"2046","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2047","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Wells Fargo Funds Trust:"
"2048","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"2049","the Wells Fargo Emerging Markets Bond Fund, Wells Fargo Factor"
"2050","Enhanced Emerging Markets Fund,Wells Fargo Factor Enhanced"
"2051","International Fund, Wells Fargo Factor Enhanced Large Cap Fund,"
"2052","Wells Fargo Factor Enhanced Small Cap Fund, Wells Fargo High Yield"
"2053","Corporate Bond Fund, Wells Fargo International Government Bond"
"2054","Fund, and Wells Fargo U.S.Core Bond Fund (collectively, the Funds),"
"2055","eight of the funds constituting the Wells Fargo Funds Trust, as"
"2056","of and for the year ended February 28, 2018, in accordance"
"2057","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"2058","Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"2059","internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"2060","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"2061","proceduresfor the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"2062","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"2063","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"2064","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2065","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2066","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"2067","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"2068","In fulfilling this responsibility,estimates and judgments"
"2069","by management are required to assess the expected benefits"
"2070","and related costs of controls.A fund's internal control over"
"2071","financial reporting is a process designed toprovide reasonable"
"2072","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"2073","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"2074","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2075","accounting principles (GAAP). A fund's internal control over"
"2076","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"2077","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"2078","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"2079","and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"2080","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2081","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2082","accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"2083","fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"2084","management andtrustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"2085","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2086","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the fund's"
"2087","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2088","statements."
"2089","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2090","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2091","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2092","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2093","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"2094","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"2095","deteriorate."
"2096","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2097","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2098","management or employees,in the normal course of performing their"
"2099","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"2100","basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"2101","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2102","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"2103","of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"2104","preventedor detected on a timely basis."
"2105","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2106","reportingwas for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2107","paragraph and would notnecessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"2108","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"2109","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"2110","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"2111","internal control over financial reporting and their operations,"
"2112","including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider"
"2113","to be a material weaknessas defined above as of February 28, 2018."
"2114","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"2115","management and the Board of Trustees of Wells Fargo Funds Trust and the"
"2116","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"2117","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"2339","banking laws and regulations."
"2340","In performing all Fund-level administrative services under"
"2341","this Section 2(b), the Manager shall: (a) act in conformity with the"
"2342","Trust's Declaration of Trust (and By-Laws, if any), the 1940 Act,"
"2343","and any other applicable laws as may be amended from time to"

"2359","the Trust. Manager will be liable for acts or omissions of any such"
"2360","sub-administrators under the standards of care described herein"
"2361","under Section 11."
"2362","Section 3. Delivery of Documents to the Manager. The"
"2363","Trust has furnished the Manager with true, correct and complete"
"2364","copies of the following documents:"
"2365","(a) The Declaration of Trust, as in effect on the date hereof;"
"2366","(b) The Registration Statement filed with the Commission"
"2367","under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act; and"

"2373","shall furnish the Manager with any further documents, materials or"
"2374","information that the Manager may reasonably request in"
"2375","connection with the performance of its duties hereunder."
"2376","Section 4. Delegation of Responsibilities. The Manager"
"2377","may carry out any of its obligations under this Agreement (other"
"2378","than under Section 2(b) hereof) by employing, subject to"
"2379","supervision by the Manager, one or more Sub-Manager(s) who are"
"2380","registered as investment advisers pursuant to the Investment"
"2381","Advisers Act of 1940 (Sub-Advisers). Each Sub-Adviser's"
"2382","employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement"
"2383","approved by the Board and if required, receiving any other"
"2384","approvals required under the 1940 Act(unless the Commission or"
"2385","its staff has given authorization or issued an interpretation"
"2386","dispensing with any such requirement). The Manager shall not be"
"2387","liable hereunder for any act or omission of any Sub-Adviser,"
"2388","except for failure to exercise good faith in the employment of the"
"2389","Sub-Adviser and for failure to exercise appropriate supervision of"
"2390","such Sub-Adviser, and as may otherwise be agreed in writing. The"
"2391","Manager shall be solely responsible for compensating any Sub-"
"2392","Adviser for services rendered under any Sub-Advisory Agreement."
"2393","The Manager may, from time to time and at any time, terminate"
"2394","any Sub-Adviser and reassume the responsibilities assigned to such"
"2395","Sub-Adviser with respect to any Fund solely with the approval of"
"2396","the Board."
"2397","Section 5. Control by Board. Any investment"
"2398","management activities undertaken by the Manager pursuant to this"
"2399","Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken by the"
"2400","Manager on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be subject to the"
"2401","direction and control of the Board."
"2402","Section 6. Compliance with Applicable Requirements."
"2403","In carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, the Manager"
"2404","shall at all times comply with:"
"2405","(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"2406","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"2407","(b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be"
"2408","amended from time to time, filed with the Commission"
"2409","under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"2410","(c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it"
"2411","may be amended from time to time;"
"2412","(d) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"2413","amended, applicable to the Trust or the Funds, and any"
"2414","rules and regulations adopted thereunder; and"
"2415","(e) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law, and"
"2416","any rules and regulations adopted thereunder."
"2417","Section 7. Proxies. The Manager shall have responsibility"
"2418","to vote proxies solicited with respect to issuers of securities in"
"2419","which assets of the Funds are invested in accordance with the"
"2420","Trust's policies on proxy voting."
"2421","Section 8. Broker-Dealer Relationships. In connection"
"2422","with the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds, the Manager"
"2423","is responsible for broker-dealer selection and negotiation of"
"2424","brokerage commission rates. The Manager's primary"
"2425","consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain"
"2426","the best price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to"
"2427","execute each particular transaction for a Fund, the Manager will"
"2428","consider among other things: the best net price available, the"
"2429","reliability, integrity and financial condition of the broker-dealer;"
"2430","the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value of"
"2431","the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a"
"2432","continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any"
"2433","transaction may be less favorable than that available from another"
"2434","broker-dealer if the difference is reasonably justified by other"
"2435","aspects of the portfolio execution services offered. Subject to such"
"2436","policies as the Board may from time to time determine, the"
"2437","Manager shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have"
"2438","breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely"
"2439","by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker or dealer that"
"2440","provides brokerage and research services to the Manager an"
"2441","amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"2442","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker"
"2443","or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if the"
"2444","Manager determines in good faith that such amount of commission"
"2445","was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"2446","research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in"
"2447","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"2448","responsibilities of the Manager with respect to the Fund and to"
"2449","other clients of the Manager. The Manager is further authorized to"
"2450","allocate the orders placed by it on behalf of the Funds to brokers"
"2451","and dealers who also provide brokerage and research services"
"2452","within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"2453","Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be"
"2454","in such amounts and proportions as the Manager shall determine"
"2455","and the Manager will report on said allocations regularly to the"
"2456","Board, indicating the brokers to whom such allocations have been"
"2457","made and the basis therefore."
"2458","Section 9. Expenses. All of the ordinary business"
"2459","expenses incurred in the operations of the Funds and the offering"
"2460","of their shares shall be borne by the Funds unless specifically"
"2461","provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses borne by the"
"2462","Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions, taxes,"
"2463","legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost of preparing share"
"2464","certificates, custodian, transfer agent and shareholder service agent"
"2465","costs, expense of issue, sale, redemption and repurchase of shares,"
"2466","expenses of registering and qualifying shares for sale, expenses"
"2467","relating to trustees and shareholder meetings, the cost of preparing"
"2468","and distributing reports and notices to shareholders, the fees and"
"2469","other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection with"
"2470","membership in investment company organizations and the cost of"
"2471","printing copies of prospectuses and statements of additional"
"2472","information distributed to the Funds' shareholders. In addition to"
"2473","the fees described in Section 10 of this Agreement, the Trust (or its"
"2474","other service providers, as may be provided pursuant to their"
"2475","respective agreements and contracts with the Trust) shall pay all of"
"2476","its Fund-level expenses which are not expressly assumed by the"
"2477","Manager pursuant to Section 2(b) or otherwise hereunder. The"
"2478","Fund-level expenses of legal counsel and accounting experts"
"2479","retained by the Manager, after consulting with the Trust's legal"
"2480","counsel and independent auditors, as may be reasonably necessary"
"2481","or appropriate for the performance by the Manager of its duties"
"2482","under this Agreement, shall be deemed to be Fund-level expenses"
"2483","of, and shall be paid for by, the Trust."
"2484","The Manager shall pay its own expenses in connection with"
"2485","the services to be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement and"
"2486","shall, at its own expense, provide its own office space, facilities"
"2487","and equipment. In addition, the Manager shall be responsible for"
"2488","reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Trust:"
"2489","(a) to amend the Trust's registration statement or supplement the"
"2490","Fund's prospectus, and circulate the same, to reflect a change in"
"2491","the personnel of the Manager responsible for making investment"
"2492","decisions in relation to a Fund; (b) to obtain approval required by"
"2493","the 1940 Act of a new sub-advisory agreement as a result of a"
"2494","change in control (as such term in defined in Section 2(a)(9) of"
"2495","the 1940 Act) of the Manager, or to otherwise comply with the"
"2496","1940 Act, the Securities Act, or any other applicable statute, law,"
"2497","rule or regulation, as a result of such change; or (c) to meet other"
"2498","legal or regulatory obligations caused by actions of the Manager."
"2499","Section 10. Compensation."
"2500","(a) As compensation for the investment management services"
"2501","provided under this Agreement, the Trust shall pay the"
"2502","Manager fees, payable monthly, at the annual rates"
"2503","indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule may be"
"2504","amended or supplemented from time to time. The fees"
"2505","payable pursuant to this Paragraph shall be calculated based"
"2506","on the average daily value (as determined on each business"
"2507","day at the time set forth in the Prospectus for determining"
"2508","net asset value per share) of each Fund's net assets, as"
"2509","appropriate, during the preceding month. If the fee payable"
"2510","to the Manager pursuant to this Paragraph begins to accrue"
"2511","before the end of any month or if this Agreement"
"2512","terminates before the end of any month, the fee for the"
"2513","period from the effective date to the end of that month or"
"2514","from the beginning of that month to the termination date,"
"2515","respectively, shall be prorated according to the proportion"
"2516","that the period bears to the full month in which the"
"2517","effectiveness or termination occurs. For purposes of"
"2518","calculating each such monthly fee, the value of each Fund's"
"2519","net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in that"
"2520","Fund's registration statement as then on file with the SEC"
"2521","for the computation of the value of the Fund's net assets in"
"2522","connection with the determination of the net asset value of"
"2523","Fund shares. For purposes of this Agreement, a business
day for a Fund is any day that the Fund is open for"
"2524","trading;"
"2525","(b) No fee, other than the management fee payable monthly, at"
"2526","the annual rates indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such"
"2527","Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to"
"2528","time, payable for the Fund-level administrative services set"
"2529","forth in Section 2(b) of this Agreement, shall be payable"
"2530","hereunder with respect to a Fund during any period in"
"2531","which the Fund invests all (or substantially all) of its"

"2540","that invests some or all of its investment assets in two or"
"2541","more registered, open-end management investment"
"2542","companies, or separate series thereof, in each case, in"
"2543","accordance with Section 12(d)(1)(G) under the Act, the"
"2544","rules thereunder or an exemptive order issued by the"

"2814","WHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment"
"2815","Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the 1940 Act) as an openend,"
"2816","series management investment company; and"

"2822","and conditions set forth in this Agreement;"
"2823","NOW THEREFORE, the Trust, the Adviser and Sub-Adviser agrees as"
"2824","follows:"
"2825","Section 1. The Trust; Delivery of Documents. The Trust"
"2826","is engaged in the business of investing and reinvesting its assets in"
"2827","securities of the type and in accordance with the limitations"
"2828","specified in its Declaration of Trust, as amended or supplemented"
"2829","from time to time, By-Laws (if any) and Registration Statement"
"2830","filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"
"2831","Commission) under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933"
"2832","(the Securities Act), including any representations made in the"
"2833","prospectus and statement of additional information relating to the"
"2834","Funds contained therein and as may be supplemented from time to"
"2835","time, all in such manner and to such extent as may from time to"
"2836","time be authorized by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the Board)."
"2837","The Board is authorized to issue any unissued shares in any"
"2838","number of additional classes or series. The Trust has delivered"
"2839","copies of the documents listed in this Section to the Sub-Adviser"
"2840","and will from time to time furnish the Sub-Adviser with any"
"2841","amendments thereof."
"2842","Section 2. Appointment of Sub-Adviser. Subject to the"
"2843","direction and control of the Board, the Adviser manages the"
"2844","investment and reinvestment of the assets of the Funds and"
"2845","provides for certain management and services as specified in the"
"2846","Investment Advisory Agreement between the Trust and the"
"2847","Adviser with respect to the Funds."
"2848","Subject to the direction and control of the Board, the Sub-"
"2849","Adviser shall manage the investment and reinvestment of the"
"2850","assets of the Funds, and without limiting the generality of the"
"2851","foregoing, shall provide the management and other services"
"2852","specified below, all in such manner and to such extent as may be"
"2853","directed from time to time by the Adviser."
"2854","The Sub-Adviser acknowledges that the Fund and other"
"2855","mutual funds advised by the Adviser (collectively, the fund
complex) may engage in transactions with certain sub-advisers in"
"2856","the fund complex (and their affiliated persons) in reliance on"
"2857","exemptions under Rule 10f-3, Rule 12d3-1, Rule 17a-10 and Rule"
"2858","17e-1 under the 1940 Act. Accordingly, the Sub-Adviser hereby"
"2859","agrees that it will not consult with any other sub-adviser of a fund"
"2860","in the fund complex that is not an affiliated person (as that term is"
"2861","defined in the 1940 Act) of Wells Fargo & Company (Wells
Fargo), or an affiliated person of such a sub-adviser, concerning"
"2862","transactions for a fund in securities or other fund assets. With"
"2863","respect to a multi-managed Fund, the Sub-Adviser shall be limited"
"2864","to managing only the discrete portion of the Fund's portfolio as"
"2865","may be determined from time-to-time by the Board or the Adviser,"
"2866","and shall not consult with the any Sub-adviser that is not an"
"2867","affiliated person of Wells Fargo as to any other portion of the"
"2868","Fund's portfolio concerning transactions for the Fund in securities"
"2869","or other Fund assets."
"2870","Section 3. Duties of the Sub-Adviser."
"2871","(a) The Sub-Adviser shall make decisions with respect"
"2872","to all purchases and sales of securities and other investment assets"
"2873","for the Funds. To carry out such decisions, the Sub-Adviser is"
"2874","hereby authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact for the Trust, for"
"2875","the account of, at the risk of and in the name of the Trust, to place"
"2876","orders and issue instructions with respect to those transactions of"
"2877","the Funds. In all purchases, sales and other transactions in"
"2878","securities for the Funds, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to exercise"
"2879","full discretion and act for the Trust in the same manner and with"
"2880","the same force and effect as the Trust might or could do with"
"2881","respect to such purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as"
"2882","with respect to all other things necessary or incidental to the"
"2883","furtherance or conduct of such purchases, sales or other"
"2884","transactions."
"2885","(b) The Sub-Adviser will report to the Board at each"
"2886","regular meeting thereof all material changes in the Funds since the"
"2887","prior report, and will also keep the Board informed of important"
"2888","developments affecting the Trust, the Funds and the Sub-Adviser, and"
"2889","on its own initiative will furnish the Board from time to time with such"
"2890","information as the Sub-Adviser may believe appropriate, whether"
"2891","concerning the individual companies whose securities are held by a"
"2892","Fund, the industries in which they engage, or the economic, social or"
"2893","political conditions prevailing in each country in which the Fund"
"2894","maintains investments. The Sub-Adviser will also furnish the Board"
"2895","with such statistical and analytical information with respect to"
"2896","securities in the Funds as the Sub-Adviser may believe appropriate or"
"2897","as the Board reasonably may request. In making purchases and sales"
"2898","of securities for the Funds, the Sub-Adviser will comply with the"
"2899","policies set from time to time by the Board as well as the limitations"
"2900","imposed by the Trust's Declaration of Trust, as amended from time to"
"2901","time, By-Laws (if any), Registration Statement under the Act and the"
"2902","Securities Act, the limitations in the Act and in the Internal Revenue"
"2903","Code of 1986, as amended applicable to the Trust and the investment"
"2904","objectives, policies and restrictions of the Funds."
"2905","(c) The Sub-Adviser may from time to time employ or"
"2906","associate with such persons as the Sub-Adviser believes to be"
"2907","appropriate or necessary to assist in the execution of the Sub-"
"2908","Adviser's duties hereunder, the cost of performance of such duties to"
"2909","be borne and paid by the Sub-Adviser. No obligation may be"
"2910","imposed on the Trust in any such respect."
"2911","(d) The Sub-Adviser shall maintain records relating to"

"2915","and maintained, in such form, for such periods and in such locations"
"2916","as may be required by applicable law, all documents and records"
"2917","relating to the services provided by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this"
"2918","Agreement required to be prepared and maintained by the Trust"
"2919","pursuant to the rules and regulations of any national, state, or local"
"2920","government entity with jurisdiction over the Trust, including the"
"2921","Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue"
"2922","Service. The books and records pertaining to the Trust which are in"
"2923","possession of the Sub-Adviser shall be the property of the Trust."
"2924","The Trust, or the Trust's authorized representatives (including the"
"2925","Adviser), shall have access to such books and records at all times"
"2926","during the Sub-Adviser's normal business hours. Upon the"
"2927","reasonable request of the Trust, copies of any such books and"
"2928","records shall be provided promptly by the Sub-Adviser to the Trust"
"2929","or the Trust's authorized representatives."
"2930","Section 4. Control by Board. As is the case with respect"
"2931","to the Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, any"
"2932","investment activities undertaken by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to"
"2933","this Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken by the"
"2934","Sub-Adviser on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be subject to"
"2935","the direction and control the Trust's Board."
"2936","Section 5. Compliance with Applicable Requirements. In"
"2937","carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser"
"2938","shall at all times comply with:"
"2939","(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any"
"2940","rules and regulations adopted thereunder;"
"2941","(b) the provisions of the registration statement of the"
"2942","Trust, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time,"
"2943","under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"2944","(c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the"
"2945","Trust, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time;"
"2946","(d) the provisions of any By-laws of the Trust, if"
"2947","adopted and as it may be amended from time to time, or"
"2948","resolutions of the Board as may be adopted from time to time;"
"2949","(e) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of"
"2950","1986, as amended, applicable to the Trust or the Funds;"
"2951","(f) any other applicable provisions of state or federal"
"2952","law; and"
"2953","In addition, any code of ethics adopted by the Sub-Adviser"
"2954","must comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act, as it may be"
"2955","amended from time to time, and any broadly accepted industry"
"2956","practices, if requested by the Trust or the Adviser."
"2957","Section 6. Broker-Dealer Relationships. The Sub-"
"2958","Adviser is responsible for the purchase and sale of securities for"
"2959","the Funds, broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of brokerage"
"2960","commission rates. The Sub-Adviser's primary consideration in"
"2961","effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best price and"
"2962","execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular"
"2963","transaction for a Fund, the Sub-Adviser will take the following into"
"2964","consideration: the best net price available, the reliability, integrity"
"2965","and financial condition of the broker-dealer; the size of and"
"2966","difficulty in executing the order; and the value of the expected"
"2967","contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing basis."
"2968","Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less"
"2969","favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the"
"2970","difference is reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio"
"2971","execution services offered. Subject to such policies as the Trust's"
"2972","Board of Trustees may from time to time determine, the Sub-"
"2973","Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have"
"2974","breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely"
"2975","by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker or dealer that"
"2976","provides brokerage and research services to the Sub-Adviser an"
"2977","amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"2978","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker"
"2979","or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if the"
"2980","Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of"
"2981","commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"2982","brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer,"
"2983","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"2984","responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund and to"
"2985","other clients of the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser is further"
"2986","authorized to allocate the orders placed by it on behalf of the Funds"
"2987","to brokers and dealers who also provide research or statistical"
"2988","material, or other services to the Funds or to the Sub-Adviser."
"2989","Such allocation shall be in such amounts and proportions as the"
"2990","Sub-Adviser shall determine and the Sub-Adviser will report on"
"2991","said allocations regularly to the Board of Trustees of the Trust"
"2992","indicating the brokers to whom such allocations have been made"
"2993","and the basis therefor."
"2994","Section 7. Expenses of the Fund. All of the ordinary"
"2995","business expenses incurred in the operations of the Funds and the"
"2996","offering of their shares shall be borne by the Funds unless"
"2997","specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement. These expenses"
"2998","borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage"
"2999","commissions, taxes, legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost"
"3000","of preparing share certificates, custodian, transfer agent and"
"3001","shareholder service agent costs, expense of issue, sale, redemption"
"3002","and repurchase of shares, expenses of registering and qualifying"
"3003","shares for sale, expenses relating to trustees and shareholder"
"3004","meetings, the cost of preparing and distributing reports and notices"
"3005","to shareholders, the fees and other expenses incurred by the Funds"
"3006","in connection with membership in investment company"
"3007","organizations and the cost of printing copies of prospectuses and"
"3008","statements of additional information distributed to the Funds'"
"3009","shareholders."
"3010","Section 8. Compensation. As compensation for the subadvisory"
"3011","services provided under this Agreement, the Adviser shall"
"3012","pay the Sub-Adviser fees, payable monthly, the annual rates"
"3013","indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule may be amended"
"3014","or supplemented from time to time. It is understood that the"
"3015","Adviser shall be responsible for the Sub-Adviser's fee for its"
"3016","services hereunder, and the Sub-Adviser agrees that it shall have"
"3017","no claim against the Trust or the Funds with respect to"
"3018","compensation under this Agreement."
"3019","Section 9. Standard of Care. The Trust and Adviser shall"
"3020","expect of the Sub-Adviser, and the Sub-Adviser will give the Trust"
"3021","and the Adviser the benefit of, the Sub-Adviser's best judgment"
"3022","and efforts in rendering its services to the Trust, and as an"
"3023","inducement to the Sub-Adviser's undertaking these services at the"
"3024","compensation level specified, the Sub-Adviser shall not be liable"
"3025","hereunder for any mistake in judgment. In the absence of willful"
"3026","misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard of"
"3027","obligations or duties hereunder on the part of the Sub-Adviser or"
"3028","any of its officers, directors, employees or agents, the Sub-Adviser"
"3029","shall not be subject to liability to the Trust or to any shareholders"
"3030","in the Trust for any act or omission in the course of, or connected"
"3031","with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be"
"3032","sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security."
"3033","Section 10. Non-Exclusivity. The services of the Sub-"
"3034","Adviser to the Adviser and the Trust are not to be deemed to be"
"3035","exclusive, and the Sub-Adviser shall be free to render investment"
"3036","advisory and administrative or other services to others (including"
"3037","other investment companies) and to engage in other activities. It is"
"3038","understood and agreed that officers or directors of the Sub-Adviser"
"3039","are not prohibited from engaging in any other business activity or"
"3040","from rendering services to any other person, or from serving as"
"3041","partners, officers, directors or trustees of any other firm or trust,"
"3042","including other investment advisory companies."
"3043","Section 11. Records. The Sub-Adviser shall, with respect to"

"3048","confirmations of portfolio trades and such other records as the"
"3049","Adviser or the Funds' Administrator reasonably requests to be"
"3050","maintained. All such records shall be maintained in a form"
"3051","acceptable to the Funds and in compliance with the provisions of"
"3052","Rule 31a-1 or any successor rule. All such records will be the"
"3053","property of the Funds, and will be available for inspection and use"
"3054","by the Funds and their authorized representatives (including the"
"3055","Adviser). The Sub-Adviser shall promptly, upon the Trust's"
"3056","request, surrender to the Funds those records which are the"
"3057","property of the Trust or any Fund. The Sub-Adviser will promptly"
"3058","notify the Funds' Administrator if it experiences any difficulty in"
"3059","maintaining the records in an accurate and complete manner."
"3060","Section 12. Term and Approval. This Agreement shall"
"3061","become effective with respect to a Fund after it is approved in"
"3062","accordance with the express requirements of the 1940 Act, and"
"3063","executed by the Trust, Adviser and Sub-Adviser and shall"
"3064","thereafter continue from year to year, provided that the"

"3285","2055 Fund), and the Wells Fargo Target 2060 Fund (formerly Wells"
"3286","Fargo Dow Jones Target 2060 Fund) (collectively, the Funds), twelve"
"3287","of the funds constituting the Wells Fargo Funds Trust, as of and"
"3288","for the year ended February 28, 2018, in accordance with"
"3289","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3290","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"3291","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"3292","as a basis for designingour auditing procedures for the purpose"
"3293","ofexpressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"3294","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"3295","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'internal"
"3296","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"3297","opinion."
"3298","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"3299","maintaining effectiveinternal control over financial reporting."
"3300","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3301","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"3302","related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"3303","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"3304","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"3305","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"3306","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"3307","principles (GAAP). A fund's internal control over financial"
"3308","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"3309","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"3310","accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions"
"3311","of the assets of the fund; (2) providereasonable assurance that"
"3312","transactions are recorded as necessary topermit preparation of"
"3313","financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and"
"3314","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"3315","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"3316","provide reasonable assurance regardingprevention or timely detection"
"3317","of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the fund's assets"
"3318","thatcouldhave a material effect on the financial statements."
"3319","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3320","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"3321","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"3322","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"3323","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"3324","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3325","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"3326","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"3327","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"3328","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"3329","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"3330","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is"
"3331","a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds'"
"3332","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"3333","detected on a timely basis."
"3334","Our consideration of the Funds'internal control over financial"
"3335","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"3336","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"3337","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"3338","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"3339","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"3340","internal control over financial reporting and their operations,"
"3341","includingcontrols over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"3342","material weakness as defined above as of February 28, 2018."

"4123","transactions and the placing and allocation of brokerage orders as are"
"4124","required to be maintained by the Trust under the Act. The Sub-Adviser"
"4125","shall prepare and maintain, or cause to be prepared and maintained, in such"
"4126","form, for such periods and in such locations as may be required by"
"4127","applicable law, all documents and records relating to the services provided"

"4130","national, state, or local government entity with jurisdiction over the Trust,"
"4131","including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal"
"4132","Revenue Service. The books and records pertaining to the Trust which are"
"4133","in possession of the Sub-Adviser shall be the property of the Trust. The"
"4134","Trust, or the Trust's authorized representatives (including the Adviser), shall"
"4135","have access to such books and records at all times during the Sub-Adviser's"
"4136","normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of the Trust, copies of"
"4137","any such books and records shall be provided promptly by the Sub-Adviser"
"4138","to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives."
"4139","Section 4. Control by Board. As is the case with respect to the"
"4140","Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, any investment"
"4141","activities undertaken by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as"
"4142","well as any other activities undertaken by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the"
"4143","Funds, shall at all times be subject to the direction and control the Trust's"
"4144","Board."
"4145","Section 5. Compliance with Applicable Requirements. In"
"4146","carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall at"
"4147","all times comply with:"
"4148","(a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and"
"4149","regulations adopted thereunder;"
"4150","(b) the provisions of the registration statement of the Trust, as"
"4151","it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, under the"
"4152","Securities Act and the 1940 Act;"
"4153","(c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it"
"4154","may be amended or supplemented from time to time;"
"4155","(d) the provisions of any By-laws of the Trust, if adopted and"
"4156","as it may be amended from time to time, or resolutions of the Board as"
"4157","may be adopted from time to time;"
"4158","(e) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"
"4159","amended, applicable to the Trust or the Funds;"
"4160","(f) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law; and"
"4161","In addition, any code of ethics adopted by the Sub-Adviser must"
"4162","comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act, as it may be amended from"
"4163","time to time, and any broadly accepted industry practices, if requested by"
"4164","the Trust or the Adviser."
"4165","Section 6. Broker-Dealer Relationships. The Sub-Adviser is"
"4166","responsible for the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds, brokerdealer"
"4167","selection, and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Sub-"
"4168","Adviser's primary consideration in effecting a security transaction will be"
"4169","to obtain the best price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to"
"4170","execute each particular transaction for a Fund, the Sub-Adviser will take"
"4171","the following into consideration: the best net price available, the"
"4172","reliability, integrity and financial condition of the broker-dealer; the size"
"4173","of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value of the expected"
"4174","contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing basis."
"4175","Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less"
"4176","favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is"
"4177","reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services"
"4178","offered. Subject to such policies as the Trust's Board of Trustees may"
"4179","from time to time determine, the Sub-Adviser shall not be deemed to have"
"4180","acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this Agreement"
"4181","or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker or"
"4182","dealer that provides brokerage and research services to the Sub-Adviser an"
"4183","amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in"
"4184","excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have"
"4185","charged for effecting that transaction, if the Sub-Adviser determines in"
"4186","good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to"
"4187","the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker"
"4188","or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the"
"4189","overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund and to"
"4190","other clients of the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser is further authorized to"
"4191","allocate the orders placed by it on behalf of the Funds to brokers and"
"4192","dealers who also provide research or statistical material, or other services"
"4193","to the Funds or to the Sub-Adviser. Such allocation shall be in such"
"4194","amounts and proportions as the Sub-Adviser shall determine and the Sub-"
"4195","Adviser will report on said allocations regularly to the Board of Trustees"
"4196","of the Trust indicating the brokers to whom such allocations have been"
"4197","made and the basis therefor."
"4198","Section 7. Expenses of the Fund. All of the ordinary business"
"4199","expenses incurred in the operations of the Funds and the offering of their"
"4200","shares shall be borne by the Funds unless specifically provided otherwise"
"4201","in this Agreement. These expenses borne by the Trust include, but are not"
"4202","limited to, brokerage commissions, taxes, legal, auditing or governmental"
"4203","fees, the cost of preparing share certificates, custodian, transfer agent and"
"4204","shareholder service agent costs, expense of issue, sale, redemption and"
"4205","repurchase of shares, expenses of registering and qualifying shares for"
"4206","sale, expenses relating to trustees and shareholder meetings, the cost of"
"4207","preparing and distributing reports and notices to shareholders, the fees and"
"4208","other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection with membership in"
"4209","investment company organizations and the cost of printing copies of"
"4210","prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to the"
"4211","Funds' shareholders."
"4212","Section 8. Compensation. As compensation for the sub-advisory"
"4213","services provided under this Agreement, the Adviser shall pay the Sub-"
"4214","Adviser fees, payable monthly, the annual rates indicated on Schedule A"
"4215","hereto, as such Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to"
"4216","time. It is understood that the Adviser shall be responsible for the Sub-"
"4217","Adviser's fee for its services hereunder, and the Sub-Adviser agrees that it"
"4218","shall have no claim against the Trust or the Funds with respect to"
"4219","compensation under this Agreement."
"4220","Section 9. Standard of Care. The Trust and Adviser shall expect of"
"4221","the Sub-Adviser, and the Sub-Adviser will give the Trust and the Adviser"
"4222","the benefit of, the Sub-Adviser's best judgment and efforts in rendering its"
"4223","services to the Trust, and as an inducement to the Sub-Adviser's"

"4225","Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any mistake in judgment. In the"
"4226","absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard"

"4232","or sale of any security."
"4233","Section 10. Non-Exclusivity. The services of the Sub-Adviser to"
"4234","the Adviser and the Trust are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the"
"4235","Sub-Adviser shall be free to render investment advisory and"
"4236","administrative or other services to others (including other investment"

"4252","representatives (including the Adviser). The Sub-Adviser shall promptly,"
"4253","upon the Trust's request, surrender to the Funds those records which are"
"4254","the property of the Trust or any Fund. The Sub-Adviser will promptly"
"4255","notify the Funds' Administrator if it experiences any difficulty in"

"4274","vote of a majority of a Fund's outstanding voting securities, or by the"
"4275","Adviser or Sub-Adviser, on sixty (60) days written notice to the other"

"4301","whether federal or of any state, by the Funds, their officers, directors,"

"4305","have and which may not be waived under any applicable federal and state"
"4306","securities laws."
"4307","Section 16. Notices. Any notices under this Agreement shall be in"

"4318","interpretation of any term or provision of this Agreement having a"
"4319","counterpart in or otherwise derived from a term or provision of the 1940"
"4320","Act shall be resolved by reference to such terms or provision of the 1940"

"4325","pursuant to the 1940 Act. In addition, where the effect of a requirement of"

"4327","Agreement is revised by rule, regulation or order of the Commission, such"
"4328","provision shall be deemed to incorporate the effect of such rule, regulation"
"4329","or order. The duties and obligations of the parties under this Agreement"

"4332","Section 18. Amendment. This Agreement supersedes the subadvisory"
"4333","agreement among Wells Fargo Funds Trust, Wells Fargo Bank,"
"4334","N.A. and Wells Fargo Capital Management Incorporated dated November"
"4335","8, 1999, as approved by the Board of Trustees on March 26, 1999 as"
"4336","amended October 28, 1999, May 9, 2000 and July 25, 2000. No provision"
"4337","of this Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated"
"4338","orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against"
"4339","which enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is"
"4340","sought. If shareholder approval of an amendment is required under the"
"4341","1940 Act, no such amendment shall become effective until approved by a"
"4342","vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of the affected Funds."
"4343","Otherwise, a written amendment of this Agreement is effective upon the"
"4344","approval of the Board of Trustees, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser."
"4345","Section 19. Wells Fargo Name. The Sub-Adviser and the Trust"
"4346","each agree that the name Wells Fargo, which comprises a component of"
"4347","the Trust's name, is a property right of the parent of the Adviser. The"
"4348","Trust agrees and consents that: (i) it will use the words Wells Fargo as a"
"4349","component of its corporate name, the name of any series or class, or all of"
"4350","the above, and for no other purpose; (ii) it will not grant to any third party"
"4351","the right to use the name Wells Fargo for any purpose; (iii) the Adviser"
"4352","or any corporate affiliate of the Adviser may use or grant to others the"
"4353","right to use the words Wells Fargo, or any combination or abbreviation"
"4354","thereof, as all or a portion of a corporate or business name or for any"
"4355","commercial purpose, other than a grant of such right to another registered"

"4357","and (iv) in the event that the Adviser or an affiliate thereof is no longer"
"4358","acting as investment adviser to any Fund or class of a Fund, the Trust"
"4359","shall, upon request by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be"
"4360","necessary to change its corporate name to one not containing the words"
"4361","Wells Fargo and following such change, shall not use the words Wells
Fargo, or any combination thereof, as a part of its corporate name or for"
"4362","any other commercial purpose, and shall use its best efforts to cause its"
"4363","trustees, officers and shareholders to take any and all actions that the"
"4364","Adviser may request to effect the foregoing and to reconvey to the Adviser"
"4365","any and all rights to such words."

"4502","WELLS FARGO FUNDS TRUST"
"4503","This fee agreement is made as of the 27th day of March, 2009,"

"4507","WHEREAS, the parties and Wells Fargo Funds Trust (the Trust)"
"4508","have entered into an Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement"
"4509","(Sub-Advisory Agreement) whereby the Sub-Adviser provides"
"4510","investment management advice to each series of the Trust as"
"4511","listed in Appendix A to the Sub-Advisory Agreement"
"4512","(each a Fund and collectively the Funds)."
"4513","WHEREAS, the Sub-Advisory Agreement provides that the fees to"
"4514","be paid to the Sub-Adviser are to be as agreed upon in writing"
"4515","by the parties."
"4516","NOW THEREFORE, the parties agree that the fees to be paid to"

"4518","as follows on a monthly basis by applying the annual rates described"
"4519","in this Schedule A to Appendix A for each Fund listed in Appendix A."
"4520","The Sub-Adviser shall receive a fee as described in this Schedule A"
