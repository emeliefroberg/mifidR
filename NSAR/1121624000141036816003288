"1427","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"1428","Firm"
"1429","The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Calvert"
"1430","Impact Fund, Inc.:"
"1431","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"1432","financial statements of Calvert Small Cap Fund,"
"1433","Calvert Global Energy Solutions Fund, Calvert"
"1434","Global Water Fund, and Calvert Green Bond"
"1435","Fund, each a series of Calvert Impact Fund, Inc."
"1436","(hereafter referred to as the Funds), as of and"
"1437","for the year ended September 30, 2016, in"
"1438","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1439","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"1440","we considered the Funds' internal"
"1441","control over financial reporting, including"
"1442","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"1443","for"
"1444","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"1445","of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1446","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"1447","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1448","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1449","Funds' internal control over financial"
"1450","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"1451","opinion."
"1452","Management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1453","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1454","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"1455","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1456","management are required to assess the expected"
"1457","benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"1458","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"1459","is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1460","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1461","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1462","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1463","generally accepted accounting principles."
"1464","A company's internal control over financial"
"1465","reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"1466","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"1467","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1468","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1469","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1470","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1471","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1472","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1473","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1474","expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"1475","accordance with authorizations of"
"1476","management and directors of the company; and (3)"
"1477","provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1478","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1479","acquisition, use, or disposition of the"
"1480","company's assets that could have a material effect"
"1481","on the financial statements."
"1482","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1483","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"1484","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1485","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1486","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1487","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"1488","that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1489","procedures may deteriorate."
"1490","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1491","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"1492","of a control does not allow management or"
"1493","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1494","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1495","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1496","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1497","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1498","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1499","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1500","Funds'"
"1501","annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1502","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1503","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control"
"1504","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"1505","purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"1506","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1507","internal control that might be material weaknesses"
"1508","under standards established by the Public"
"1509","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1510","However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"1511","the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1512","reporting and its operation, including controls"
"1513","over"
"1514","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"1515","material weakness as defined above as of"
"1516","September 30, 2016."
