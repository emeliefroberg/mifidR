"2364","we considered the Funds internal control over financial reporting,"
"2365","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"2366"," for designing"
"2367","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"2368","opinion on the"
"2369"," financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"2370"," Form N-SAR,"
"2371"," but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"2372","effectiveness"
"2373","of the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"2374","Accordingly,"
"2375"," we express no such opinion."
"2376","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"2377"," and maintaining"
"2378"," effective internal control over financial reporting."
"2379"," In fulfilling this"
"2380"," responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"2381","are required to"
"2382","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"2383","  A companys internal control over financial reporting is"
"2384","a process designed"
"2385","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"2386","of financial reporting"
"2387"," and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"2388"," purposes in accordance"
"2389","with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"2390"," A companys internal control"
"2391"," over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"2392","procedures that (1) pertain"
"2393","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"2394"," accurately and fairly"
"2395","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"2396","of the company;"
"2397","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"2398","recorded as necessary"
"2399"," to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2400","accordance with GAAP,"
"2401","and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"2402"," are being made only"
"2403","in accordance with authorizations of management"
"2404"," and trustees of the company;"
"2405"," and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"2406"," prevention or"
"2407"," timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"2408"," use or"
"2409","disposition of the companys assets that could"
"2410"," have a material effect"
"2411","on the financial statements."
"2412","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"2413"," control over financial"
"2414"," reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"2415","  Also, projections"
"2416"," of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"2417"," periods are subject to the"
"2418"," risk that controls may become inadequate"
"2419"," because of changes in conditions,"
"2420"," or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2421"," policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2422","A deficiency in internal control over"
"2423","financial reporting exists when the design"
"2424","or operation of a control does not allow"
"2425","management or employees, in the normal"
"2426","course of performing their assigned"
"2427","functions, to prevent or detect"
"2428","misstatements on a timely basis."
"2429","A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"2430","or a combination of deficiencies,"
"2431","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"2432"," such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"2433","that a material misstatement of a"
"2434"," Funds annual or interim financial statements"
"2435"," will not be prevented or"
"2436"," detected on a timely basis."
"2437","Our consideration of the Funds internal control"
"2438"," over financial reporting"
"2439"," was for the limited purpose described in the"
"2440","first paragraph and would"
"2441","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"2442","internal control that might"
"2443","be material weaknesses under standards"
"2444","established by the Public Company"
"2445","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"2446","However, we noted no"
"2447","deficiencies in the Funds internal control"
"2448","over financial reporting"
"2449","and its operation, including controls over"
"2450"," safeguarding securities,"
"2451"," that we consider to be a material weakness"
"2452"," as defined above as"
"2453"," of October 31, 2015."
