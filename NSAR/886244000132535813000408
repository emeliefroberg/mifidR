"5514","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"5515","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of The UBS Funds"
"5516","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of The UBS Funds (comprising, respectively, UBS Equity Long-Short Multi-Strategy Fund (formerly, UBS Market Neutral Multi-Strategy Fund), UBS International Equity Fund, UBS U.S. Defensive Equity Fund (formerly, UBS U.S. Equity Alpha Fund), UBS U.S. Equity Opportunity Fund, UBS U.S. Large Cap Equity Fund, UBS U.S. Small Cap Growth Fund, UBS Dynamic Alpha Fund, UBS Global Allocation Fund, UBS Global Frontier Fund, UBS Multi-Asset Income Fund, UBS Core Plus Bond Fund, UBS Emerging Markets Debt Fund, and UBS Fixed Income Opportunities Fund) (collectively, the ?Company?), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Company?s internal control over financial reporting, including control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company?s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"5517","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company?s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company?s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company?s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"5518","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5519","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company?s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"5520","Our consideration of the Company?s internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Company?s internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of June 30, 2013."
"5521","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Trustees of The UBS Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"5542","On January 28, 2013 the UBS U.S. Equity Alpha Fund became the UBS U.S. Defensive Equity Fund."
"5543","The Fund?s 80% policy changed from investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets(plus borrowings for investment purposes, if any) in equity securities of US companies to investing, undernormal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings for investment purposes, if any) inequity and/or equity-related instruments of US companies. Equity-related instruments include securities or other instruments that derive their value from equity securities and may include such instruments as short sales of equity securities, and futures and options on equity securities."
"5544","The Advisor will manage the Fund?s equity risk by utilizing an options-based strategy designed to seek to"
"5545","reduce systematic market risk in the Fund?s portfolio in extreme down markets. The Advisor will regularly"
"5546","purchase and sell exchange-traded and over-the-counter put and call options on securities and indices in"
"5547","order to hedge the Fund?s portfolio to seek to limit the Fund?s downside equity risk in extreme down markets. The Advisor believes that the options-based overlay strategy will provide the Fund with reduced downside equity risk in extreme down markets in an efficient and price-sensitive manner, while enabling the Fund to participate in rising equity markets."
