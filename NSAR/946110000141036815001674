"3169","<TEXT>"
"3170","77D: Policies with respect to security investments"
"3171","On or about August 31, 2015, the fund seeks to achieve its investment"
"3172","objective by pursuing an actively managed equity strategy, combined"
"3173","with actively managed options strategies. These strategies are intended"
"3174","to provide the fund with a portfolio that will generate attractive"
"3175","long-term total returns, while limiting downside risk and improving"
"3176","returns during periods of significant, extreme downward market movement."
"3177","To implement the equity strategy, the fund invests in equity"
"3178","securities, including common stock, preferred stock, depositary"
"3179","receipts, options, futures, rights and warrants, as well as exchange-"
"3180","traded funds (ETFs) that invest in equity securities. Under"
"3181","normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of the value"
"3182","of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes,"
"3183","in securities of U.S. issuers."
"3184","Credit Suisse actively manages the equity strategy pursuant to a"
"3185","process that employs a proprietary investment technique designed to"
"3186","identify companies with the potential to outperform. This process"
"3187","involves four primary components: (1) life cycle stage classification,"
"3188","(2) ranking, (3) fundamental analysis, and (4) securities selection."
"3189","Credit Suisse starts by classifying companies according to life cycle"
"3190","stage (which Credit Suisse identifies as start-up, growth, cash cow,"
"3191","fading winner, restructuring, financials). A proprietary screening"
"3192","process is then used to identify and rank the companies within each"
"3193","life cycle stage in terms of relative attractiveness. The screening"
"3194","is based upon four themes: valuation (companies trading at a"
"3195","discount/premium to their theoretical values), quality (companies"
"3196","with generally high and stable levels of cash flow relative to their"
"3197","invested capital base), earnings momentum (companies with strong"
"3198","short-term earnings performance) and price momentum (companies with"
"3199","strong twelve-month price performance relative to a basket of"
"3200","regional peers). The data inputs used for these themes are derived"
"3201","from a framework developed by HOLT. HOLT is a Credit Suisse research"
"3202","group that has developed and maintains a global cash flow-based"
"3203","methodology for analyzing companies."
"3204","Credit Suisse then uses a bottom-up, fundamental analysis of the"
"3205","highlighted companies within each life cycle stage to identify companies"
"3206","that are expected to increase in price, while taking into account"
"3207","macroeconomic risks and other risk management considerations. The portion"
"3208","of the fund's investment portfolio managed pursuant to the equity"
"3209","strategy will generally consist of 50-70 positions selected by"
"3210","Credit Suisse, although the number can vary based on market"
"3211","conditions. The life cycle stage classification and rankings are"
"3212","reviewed weekly and portfolio holdings are rebalanced monthly."
"3213","Credit Suisse generally holds a position until the investment"
"3214","process described above indicates that the position be reduced or"
"3215","eliminated. Credit Suisse may also reduce or eliminate a position"
"3216","held by the fund for a variety of reasons, such as to realize"
"3217","profits or take advantage of better investment opportunities."
"3218","The fund's options strategies consist of a return enhancement strategy"
"3219","and a tail risk hedging strategy. To implement the return enhancement"
"3220","strategy, the fund enters into call and put option spread transactions"
"3221","and, to a lesser extent, purchases call and put options. The goal of"
"3222","the return enhancement strategy is to increase the fund's returns by"
"3223","generating option premium income or buying options that increase in"
"3224","value. When Credit Suisse perceives option valuations to be expensive"
"3225","(which tends to occur when investors generally expect high market"
"3226","volatility), it will seek to increase the fund's returns through"
"3227","option premium income from short option spread transactions."
"3228","In a short call option spread transaction, the fund will purchase"
"3229","call options with a strike price above the current value of the"
"3230","underlying reference asset or index (out-of-the-money call options)"
"3231","and sell a maximum of an equal number of out-of-the-money call options"
"3232","with a lower strike price than the call options purchased. In a"
"3233","short put option spread transaction, the fund will sell put options"
"3234","with a strike price below the current value of the underlying"
"3235","reference asset or index (out-of-the-money put options) and"
"3236","purchase a minimum of an equal number of out-of-the-money put"
"3237","options with a lower strike price than the put options sold."
"3238","Using short spreads enables the fund to potentially limit losses"
"3239","on options sold short. When Credit Suisse perceives options"
"3240","valuations to be inexpensive (which tends to occur when"
"3241","investors generally expect low market volatility), it will seek"
"3242","to increase the fund's returns through the purchase of out-of-the-money"
"3243","call and put options. These options transactions are intended to"
"3244","generate gains for the fund, as the options are repriced higher,"
"3245","or, in the case of purchased call options, because the value of"
"3246","the options increase as the market moves higher, or, in the case"
"3247","of purchased put options, because the value of the options"
"3248","increase as the market moves lower. The extent of the fund's"
"3249","implementation of its return enhancement strategy will"
"3250","vary over time based on Credit Suisse's assessment of"
"3251","market conditions, pricing of options,"
"3252","related risks and other factors."

"3465","Fund and Credit Suisse Global Sustainable Dividend Equity Fund"
"3466","(the Funds), each a series of Credit Suisse Opportunity Funds,"
"3467","as of and for the year or period ended October 31,2015, in"
"3468","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"3469","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"3470","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"3471","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"3472","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"3473","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"3474","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"3475","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3476","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3477","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"3478","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"3479","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3480","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"3481","related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"3482","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"3483","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"3484","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"3485","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"3486","A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"3487","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"3488","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"3489","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"3490","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"3491","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3492","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"3493","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"3494","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"3495","fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"3496","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"3497","disposition of the fund's assets that could have a material"
"3498","effect on the financial statements."
"3499","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3500","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"3501","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"3502","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"3503","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with"
"3504","the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3505","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"3506","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"3507","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"3508","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"3509","A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,"
"3510","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"3511","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds'"
"3512","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"3513","detected on a timely basis."
"3514","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3515","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"3516","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"3517","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"3518","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3519","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"3520","internal control over financial reporting and their operation,"
"3521","including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider"
"3522","to be a material weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2015."

"3524","management and the Board of Trustees of Credit Suisse Opportunity"
"3525","Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"

"3527","specified parties."
