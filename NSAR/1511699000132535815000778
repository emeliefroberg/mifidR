"747","We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including the schedule of"
"748","investments, of LK Balanced Fund (the Fund), a series of Managed Portfolio Series, as of June 30,"
"749","2015, and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net"
"750","assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the three"
"751","years in the period then ended.  These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility"
"752","of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and"
"753","financial highlights based on our audits."
"754","We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"755","Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable"
"756","assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material"
"757","misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and"
"758","disclosures in the financial statements.  Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of"
"759","June 30, 2015, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers.  An audit also includes assessing the"
"760","accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the"
"761","overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our"
"762","opinion."
"763","In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all"
"764","material respects, the financial position of LK Balanced Fund as of June 30, 2015, the results of its"
"765","operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then"
