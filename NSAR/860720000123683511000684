"857","of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of any other"
"858","portfolio/series or (b) that this Agreement has not been approved by the"
"859","vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund of"
"860","which it is a portfolio/series unless such approval shall be required by"
"861","any other applicable law or otherwise."
"862","       12.	This Agreement may be amended by the parties without"

"864","to cure, correct or supplement any ambiguous, defective or inconsistent"
"865","provision hereof, or if they deem it necessary to conform this Agreement"
"866","to the requirements of applicable federal laws or regulations, but"
"867","neither the Funds nor the Adviser shall be liable for failing to do so."
"868","       13.	This Agreement shall be construed in accordance"
"869","with the law of the State of New York and the applicable provisions"

"1454","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1455","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1456","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being"
"1457","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"1458","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1459","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"1460","company's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1461","financial statements."
"1462","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1463","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"1464","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1465","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"1466","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures"
"1467","may deteriorate."
"1468","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1469","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"1470","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1471","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1472","or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1473","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"1474","the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"1475","or detected on a timely basis."
"1476","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"1477","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1478","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"1479","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1480","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1481","in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"1482","including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"1483","material weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2011."
"1484","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"1485","and the Board of Directors of the Morgan Stanley European Equity Fund and"
"1486","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"1487","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."
