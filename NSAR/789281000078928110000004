"832","Since October 2003,"

"834"," entities (collectively,"
"835","Federated) and various"
"836","Federated-sponsored"
"837","mutual funds (Funds)"
"838","have been named as defendants"
"839","in several class action"
"840","lawsuits now pending"
"841","in the United States"
"842","District Court for the"
"843","District of Maryland."
"844","The lawsuits were"
"845","purportedly filed on"
"846","behalf of people who"
"847","purchased, owned"
"848","and/or redeemed"
"849","shares of certain Funds"
"850","during specified"
"851","periods beginning"
"852","November 1, 1998. The suits"
"853","are generally similar in"
"854","alleging that"
"855","Federated engaged in illegal"
"856","and improper trading practices"
"857","including market timing and"
"858","late trading in"
"859","concert with certain"
"860","institutional traders,"
"861","which allegedly caused"
"862","financial injury to the mutual"
"863","fund"
"864","shareholders. Federated"
"865","without admitting the validity"
"866","of any claim has reached a"
"867","preliminary settlement"
"868","with the Plaintiffs in these"
"869","cases. Any settlement would"
"870","have to be approved by the Court."
"871","     Federated entities have"
"872","also been named as defendants"
"873","in several additional lawsuits"
"874","that are now"
"875","pending in the United States"
"876","District Court for the Western"

"878","lawsuits have"
"879","been consolidated into a single"
"880","action alleging excessive"
"881","advisory fees involving one"
"882","of the Funds."
"883","     The Board of the Funds"
"884","retained the law firm of Dickstein"
"885","Shapiro LLP to represent the Funds in"
"886","each of the lawsuits described"
"887"," in the preceding two paragraphs."
"888"," Federated and the Funds, and their"
"889","respective counsel, have been"
"890","defending this litigation, and"
"891","none of the Funds remains a"
"892","defendant in"
"893","any of the lawsuits. Additional"
"894","lawsuits based upon similar allegations"
"895"," may"

"904","there can be no assurance that these"

"926","In planning and performing"
"927"," our audit of the financial"
"928","statements of Federated Intermediate"
"929","Corporate Bond Fund and"
"930","Federated Short-Term Income"
"931","Fund (collectively the Funds)"
"932","(two of"
"933","the portfolios constituting"
"934","Federated Income Securities Trust)"
"935","as of and for the year ended April"
"936","30, 2010, in accordance with"
"937","the standards of the Public"
"938","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"939","(United States), we considered"
"940","the Funds' internal control"
"941"," over financial reporting,"
"942","including"
"943","controls over safeguarding"
"944","securities, as a basis for"
"945","designing our auditing procedures"
"946"," for the"
"947","purpose of expressing our"
"948","opinion on the financial"
"949","statements and to comply with the"
"950","requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"951","but not for the purpose of"
"952","expressing an opinion on the"
"953","effectiveness of the Funds'"
"954","internal control over financial"
"955","reporting. Accordingly, we express"
"956","no"
"957","such opinion."
"958","The management of the Funds is"
"959","responsible for establishing and"
"960","maintaining effective internal"
"961","control over financial reporting."
"962","In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"963","estimates and judgments by"
"964","management are required to assess"
"965","the expected benefits and related"
"966","costs of controls. The"
"967","company's internal control over"
"968","financial reporting is a process"
"969","designed to provide reasonable"
"970","assurance regarding the reliability"
"971","of financial reporting and the"
"972","preparation of financial"
"973","statements for external purposes"
"974","in accordance with generally"
"975","accepted accounting principles. A"
"976","company's internal control over"
"977","financial reporting includes"
"978","those policies and procedures that"
"979","(1) pertain to the maintenance"
"980","of records that, in reasonable"
"981","detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"982","the transactions and dispositions"
"983","of the assets of the company; (2)"
"984","provide reasonable assurance"
"985","that transactions are recorded as"
"986","necessary to permit preparation of"
"987","financial statements in"
"988","accordance with generally accepted"
"989","accounting principles, and that"
"990","receipts and expenditures of"
"991","the company are being made only"
"992","in accordance with authorizations"
"993","of management and"
"994","directors of the company; and (3)"
"995","provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"996","prevention or timely"
"997","detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"998"," use or disposition of a company's"
"999"," assets that could have a"
"1000","material effect on the financial"
"1001","statements."
"1002","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"1003","internal control over financial"
"1004","reporting may not prevent or"
"1005","detect misstatements. Also,"
"1006","projections of any evaluation of"
"1007","effectiveness to future periods are"
"1008","subject to the risk that"
"1009","controls may become inadequate"
"1010","because of changes in conditions, or that"
"1011","the degree of compliance"
"1012","with the policies or procedures"
"1013","may deteriorate."
"1014","A deficiency in internal control"
"1015","over financial reporting exists"
"1016","when the design or operation of a"
"1017","control does not allow management"
"1018","or employees, in the normal course"
"1019"," of performing their"
"1020","assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1021"," detect misstatements on a timely"
"1022","basis. A material weakness is"
"1023","a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1024","deficiencies, in internal control"
"1025","over financial reporting, such"
"1026","that there is a reasonable"
"1027","possibility that a material"
"1028","misstatement of the company's"
"1029","annual or"
"1030","interim financial statements will"
"1031","not be prevented or detected on a"
"1032","timely basis."
"1033","Our consideration of the Funds'"
"1034","internal control over financial"
"1035","reporting was for the limited"
"1036","purpose described in the first"
"1037","paragraph and would not necessarily"
"1038","disclose all deficiencies in"
"1039","internal control that might be"
"1040","material weaknesses under standards"
"1041","established by the Public"
"1042","Fund Accounting Oversight Board"
"1043","(United States). However, we noted"
"1044","no deficiencies in the"
"1045","Funds' internal control over"
"1046","financial reporting and its operation,"
"1047","including controls over"
"1048","safeguarding securities, that we"

FEDERATED INCOME SECURITIES TRUST

MINUTES OF THE REGULAR MEETING

OF

THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES

November 12, 2009


      Pursuant to written call,
the Regular Meeting of the Board
of Trustees (the Board) of
Federated Income Securities Trust
(the Trust) convened at 9:10 A.M.
 on Thursday,
November 12, 2009, at the Ritz Carlton
in Naples, Florida, following the General
Session
Meeting of the Board
(held on November 12, 2009).
The following members, constituting a
quorum of the Board, were present in
person at the meeting:


      John F. Donahue (via telephone)
John T. Conroy, Jr.
Nicholas P. Constantakis
John F. Cunningham
J. Christopher Donahue
Maureen Lally-Green
Peter E. Madden
Charles F. Mansfield, Jr.
R. James Nicholson
Thomas M. O'Neill
John S. Walsh
James F. Will



      In addition to the
Board, the same persons were
present as were in attendance at
the close
of the General Session Meeting
held on Thursday, November 12, 2009,at
 8:00 A.M.
      Mr. Peter E. Madden presided
as Chairman, and the proceedings were
recorded by
Ms. Erin J. Dugan.
	Mr. Peter J. Germain
reported that the Board will
be asked to approve amendments to the
Rule 18f-3 Multi-Class Plan (18f-3 Plan).
He noted the amendments included lowering the
breakpoint on the front-end sales charge
on Class A Shares of Federated Short-Term
Income
Fund (FSTIFA), as well as removing FSTIFA
from the advanced commissions large ticket
program with respect to shares purchased on
or after January 15, 2010.  He then directed
 the
Board to the memorandum contained behind Tab
39 of the Meeting Materials.  Mr. Germain
explained that currently the front-end sales
 charge for FSTIFA is 0.00% for purchases of $1
million and over.  It is being proposed by
Federated Investment Management Company
 (the
Adviser) that this be modified to 0.00 %
for $250,000 and over.  Mr. Germain noted that
currently purchases between $250,000 and $1
 million would incur a front-end sales charge
 of
1.00%.  He then went on to say that Adviser
also recommends removal of FSTIFA from the
advanced commissions large ticket program,
thus eliminating a 0.75% contingent deferred
sales charge (CDSC) on FSTIFA when redeemed
up to 24 months after purchase with respect
to shares purchased on or after January 15,
2010.  Mr. Germain reported that it is the
Adviser's
belief that the proposed changes will aid in
attracting assets as investors look to move out
of the
yield curve by lowering the barriers to entry,
thus benefitting the Fund by diversifying its
customers and securities and increased cash flow.
It was also noted that if the changes are
approved, all five of Federated's ultrashort
and short/short intermediate funds would have
load-
waivers on purchases of $250,000 and over.
	Mr. Germain then reviewed the legal
considerations and business risks with the
Board,
noting that amendment to the Rule 18f-3 Plan
do not require shareholder approval.  He noted
that
should the proposed changes be approved,
supplements to the Registration Statement
 would be
prepared, filed and mailed to shareholders.
 He added that the changes would take effect
on
January 15, 2010 and that expenses associated
with this mailing are approximately $1,370.00.
	Next, Mr. Germain reported to the
Board on the proposed name change of Federated
Prudent Global Income Fund (FPGIF or the Fund),
a series of Federated Income Securities
Trust (FIST).  He explained that the Board is
being asked to change the name of the Fund to
the Federated Prudent DollarBear Fund.  Mr.
Germain reported that this is being proposed in
order to reposition the Fund as a fund that
seeks to invest in securities that will rise
relative to the
U.S. dollar.  He added that in connection with
this name change, new disclosure is being
proposed to be added to the Prospectus.
	Mr. Germain outlined the two Investment
Company Act provisions that needed to be
considered when contemplating the name change.
He explained that Section (b)(1) and Section
(b)(3) of Rule 2a-7 prohibit a registered
investment company as portraying itself as a money
market fund if it is in fact not a money market
fund.  He noted concerns on this matter due to the
word dollar being including in the proposed
Fund name.  Mr. Germain explained that in order
to eliminate any potential investor confusion,
additional prospectus cover disclosure would be
added to emphasize that the Fund is not a money
 market fund and has a fluctuating share value.
	Next, Mr. Germain reminded the Board
about provisions under the Investment Company
Act Rule 35d-1 (the Names Rule) which states
that a fund name must not be misleading and
that at least 80% of the assets must be
invested in a manner consistent with the name.
 He
reported that Fund Management has researched
other funds containing the word dollar in the
names and has found numerous examples of non-money
market funds using dollar in a
modified manner such as Strengthening Dollar,
Weak Dollar, Dollar Bear, or Dollar"
"1122","Bull.  Mr. Germain reminded the Board that the
proposed name will use dollar in a modified
fashion in conjunction with bear.  In this
regard, Mr. Germain indicated that the name
connoted a philosophy rather than a particular
specific investment strategy.  He then added that
in order to further minimize any risk of the
Fund's proposed name being characterized as
misleading, Fund Management is recommending
that the fund adopt a non-fundamental policy
that states:
	As a  non-fundamental operating policy,
under normal market
condition, the Fund will invest 70% or more
of its portfolio in
non-U.S. dollar denominated investments and
gold related
investments which my be denominated in U.S.
dollars.  The Fund
may invest, for temporary or defensive purposes,
be able to invest
more than 30% of its assets in U.S. dollar
denominated
investments.

	Mr. Germain concluded by mentioning that
 a 485(a) filing would be submitted to the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) upon
Board approval of the name change, as
discussed during the Board Meetings.  He noted
that should the SEC staff disagree with
Federated's interpretation of the Names Rule
and various other portions of the application,
Federated will hold off on implementing the
proposed name change to consider alternatives.
	A discussion ensued regarding the proposed
name change.
      The meeting was then adjourned and
reconvened at 10:25 A.M. on Thursday,
November 12, 2009, at the Ritz Carlton in Naples,
Florida.
The same persons were present as
were in attendance at the close of the Meeting held
