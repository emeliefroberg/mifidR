"2121","Milwaukee, Wisconsin"
"2122","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Muzinich Credit Opportunities Fund,  a"
"2123","series of Professionally Managed Portfolios (the ?Trust?) as of and for the period ended December 31, 2014,"
"2124","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"2125","considered their internal control over financial reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"2126","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"2127","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2128","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust?s internal control over financial reporting."
"2129","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2130","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over"
"2131","financial reporting.   In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"2132","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.   A company?s internal control over financial"
"2133","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"2134","and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance generally accepted accounting"
"2135","principles.   A company?s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"

"2141","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company?s"
"2142","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2143","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
