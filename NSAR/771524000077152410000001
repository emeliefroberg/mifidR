"527","Report of Independent Registered"
"528","Public Accounting Firm"
"529","To the Shareholders and"
"530","The Board of Trustees of"
"531","Federated Adjustable Rate Securities Fund:"
"532","In planning and performing our audits"
"533"," of the financial statements of"
"534"," Federated Adjustable Rate"
"535","Securities Fund as of and for the year"
"536","ended August 31, 2010, in accordance"
"537","with the standards of"
"538","the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"539"," Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"540","internal control over financial reporting,"
"541"," including controls over safeguarding"
"542","securities, as a"
"543","basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"544","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"545","financial statements and to comply with the"
"546","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"547","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"548"," of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"549","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"550","Management of the Funds is responsible for"
"551"," establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"552","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"553"," this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"554","management are required to assess the expected"
"555"," benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"556","company's internal control over financial"
"557","reporting is a process designed to provide"
"558"," reasonable"
"559","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"560","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"561","statements for external purposes in"
"562"," accordance with generally accepted"
"563","accounting principles. A"
"564","company's internal control over financial"
"565","reporting includes those policies and"
"566"," procedures that (1)"
"567","pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"568"," in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"569","fairly reflect the"
"570","transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"571"," of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"572"," assurance that"
"573","transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"574"," permit preparation of financial statements"
"575"," in accordance"
"576","with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"577"," and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"578","are being made in accordance with authorizations"
"579"," of management and Trustees of the company;"
"580","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"581","prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized"
"582","acquisition, use, or disposition of the company'"
"583","s assets that could have a material affect on the"
"584","financial statements."
"585","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"586"," control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"587","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"588"," evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"589","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"590","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"591","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"592","procedures may deteriorate."
"593","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"594"," reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"595","control does not allow management or employees,"
"596","in the normal course of performing their"
"597","assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"598","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"599","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"600","in internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"601","there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"602","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim"
"603","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"604","detected on a timely basis."
"605","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control"
"606","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"607","purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"608"," not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"609","internal control that might be material weaknesses"
"610"," under standards established by the Public"
"611","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"612"," However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"613","Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"614","and its operation, including controls over"
"615","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"616"," material weakness as defined above as of August"
"617","31, 2010."
"618","This report is intended solely for the information"
"619","and use of management and the Board of"

"635"," CHANGE IN INDEPENDENT"
"636"," REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"637","On May 14, 2010, the Fund's"
"638","Trustees, upon the recommendation"
"639"," of the Audit Committee, appointed KPMG LLP"
"640","(KPMG) as the Fund's independent"
"641","registered public accounting firm."
"642"," On the same date, the Fund's previous"
"643","independent registered public"
"644"," accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP"
"645"," (E&Y) resigned.  The previous reports"
"646","issued by"
"647","E&Y on the Fund's financial statements"
"648"," for the fiscal years ended August 31,"
"649"," 2008 and August 31, 2009, contained no"
"650","adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion"
"651"," nor were they qualified or modified"

"656","commencing September 1, 2009 and ending"
"657"," May 14, 2010,  (i)  there were no"

"660","financial statement disclosure or"
"661","auditing scope or procedure, which"
"662","disagreements, if not resolved to the"

"664","it to make reference to the subject matter"
"665","of the disagreements in connection with"
"666"," its reports on the financial statements"
"667","for such years; and (ii) there were no"

"670","under the Securities Exchange Act of"
"671","1934, as  amended."
"672","As indicated above, the Fund has appointed"
"673"," KPMG as the independent registered public"
"674","accounting firm to audit the"
"675","Fund's financial statements for the fiscal"
"676","year ending August 31, 2010.  During the"

"678","31, 2008 and August 31, 2009 and the interim"
"679","period commencing September 1, 2009 and ending May 14, 2010,"

"681","consulted KPMG on items which: (i) concerned the application of"
"682","accounting principles to a specified transaction,"
"683"," either completed or proposed, or the type of"
"684","audit opinion that might be"
"685","rendered on the Fund's financial statements or"

"715","Since October 2003, Federated and"
"716"," related entities (collectively,"
"717","Federated) and various"
"718","Federated-sponsored mutual funds"
"719"," (Funds) have been named as"
"720","defendants in several class action"
"721","lawsuits now pending in the United"
"722","States District Court for the District"
"723","of Maryland. The lawsuits were"
"724","purportedly filed on behalf of people"
"725"," who purchased, owned and/or redeemed"
"726","shares of certain Funds"
"727","during specified periods beginning"
"728","November 1, 1998. The suits are"
"729","generally similar in alleging that"
"730","Federated engaged in illegal and improper"
"731"," trading practices including market"
"732","timing and late trading in"
"733","concert with certain institutional traders,"
"734"," which allegedly caused financial"
"735","injury to the mutual fund"
"736","shareholders. Federated without admitting"
"737","the validity of any claim has reached"
"738","a preliminary settlement"
"739","with the Plaintiffs in these cases."
"740"," Any settlement would have to be"
"741"," approved by the Court."
"742","     Federated entities have also"
"743"," been named as defendants in several"
"744","additional lawsuits that are now"
"745","pending in the United States District"
"746","Court for the Western District of"
"747","Pennsylvania. These lawsuits have"
"748","been consolidated into a single action"
"749"," alleging excessive advisory fees"
"750","involving one of the Funds."
"751","     The Board of the Funds retained the"
"752"," law firm of Dickstein Shapiro LLP to"
"753"," represent the Funds in"
"754","each of the lawsuits described in the"
"755","preceding two paragraphs. Federated and"
"756","the Funds, and their"
"757","respective counsel, have been defending"
"758","this litigation, and none of the Funds"
"759","remains a defendant in"
"760","any of the lawsuits. Additional lawsuits"
"761"," based upon similar allegations may"
"762"," be filed in the future. The"
"763","potential impact of these lawsuits, all"
"764"," of which seek monetary damages,"
"765","attorneys' fees and expenses,"
"766","and future potential similar suits is"
"767"," uncertain. Although we do not believe"

"770","there can be no assurance that these"
"771","suits, ongoing adverse"
"772","publicity and/or other developments"
"773","resulting from the allegations in these"
"774"," matters will not result in"
