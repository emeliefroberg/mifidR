"2710","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2711","The Shareholders and Board of Directors of Tributary Funds, Inc.:"
"2712","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of each series"
"2713","within  Tributary  Funds,  Inc., consisting of Tributary Short-Intermediate Bond"
"2714","Fund,  Tributary  Income  Fund,  Tributary  Balanced Fund, Tributary Core Equity"
"2715","Fund,  Tributary  Large  Cap  Growth  Fund, Tributary Growth Opportunities Fund,"
"2716","Tributary  Small  Company  Fund  and  Tributary  International Equity Fund  (the"
"2717","Funds)  as  of  and for the period ended March 31, 2011 in accordance with the"
"2718","standards  of  the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"2719","considered  the  internal  control  over financial reporting, including controls"
"2720","over  safeguarding  securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"2721","for  the  purpose  of  expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"2722","comply  with  the  requirements  of  Form  N-SAR,  but  not  for  the purpose of"
"2723","expressing  an  opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"2724","financial  reporting.  Accordingly,  we  express  no  such  opinion."
"2725","The  management  of  the  Funds  is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2726","effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  In  fulfilling  this"
"2727","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"2728","expected  benefits  and  related costs of controls.  The Funds' internal control"
"2729","over  financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2730","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"2731","financial  statements  for  external  purposes in accordance with U.S. generally"
"2732","accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP).  The  Funds'  internal  control  over"
"2733","financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"2734","the  maintenance  of  records  that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2735","reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets of the Funds; (2)"
"2736","provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to"
"2737","permit  preparation  of  financial  statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"2738","receipts  and  expenditures  of the Funds are being made only in accordance with"
"2739","authorizations of management and Board of Managers of the Funds; and (3) provide"
"2740","reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"2741","acquisition, use, or disposition of the Funds' assets that could have a material"
"2742","effect  on  the  financial  statements."
"2743","Because  of  its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2744","may  not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2745","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2746","inadequate  because  of  changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"2747","with  the  policies  or  procedures  may  deteriorate."
"2748","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"2749","or  operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"2750","course  of  performing  their  assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"2751","misstatements  on  a  timely  basis.  A  material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2752","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2753","that  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that a material misstatement of the"
"2754","Funds'  annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"2755","on  a  timely  basis."
"2756","Our  consideration  of  the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"2757","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the  first  paragraph  and  would not"
"2758","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"2759","weaknesses  under  standards  established  by  the  Public  Company  Accounting"
"2760","Oversight  Board  (United  States).  However,  we  noted  no deficiencies in the"
"2761","Funds'  internal  control  over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"2762","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness"
"2763","as  defined  above  as  of     March  31,  2011."
