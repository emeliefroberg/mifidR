"523","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"524","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of The GAMCO Growth"
"525","Fund:"
"526","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"527","of The GAMCO Growth Fund (hereafter referred to as the Fund) as"
"528","of and for the period ended December 31, 2017, in accordance with"
"529","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"530","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"531","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"532","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"533","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"534","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"535","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"536","Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"537","do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"538","internal control over financial reporting."
"539","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"540","maintaining effective internal control"
"541","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"542","estimates and judgments by management are"
"543","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"544","controls. A fund's internal control over"
"545","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"546","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"547","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"548","for external purposes in accordance with"
"549","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"550","control over financial reporting includes those"
"551","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"552","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"553","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"554","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"555","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"556","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"557","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"558","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"559","fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"560","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"561","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect"
"562","on the financial statements."
"563","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"564","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"565","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"566","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"567","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"568","conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"569","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"570","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"571","when the design or operation of a control"
"572","does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"573","performing their assigned functions, to"
"574","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"575","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"576","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"577","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"578","misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial statements"
"579","will not be prevented or"
"580","detected on a timely basis."
"581","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"582","reporting was for the limited purpose"
"583","described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily"
"584","disclose all deficiencies in internal control over"
"585","financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"586","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"587","Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"588","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"589","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that"
"590","we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"591","December 31, 2017."
"592","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"593","management and the Board of Trustees of the"
"594","Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"595","intended to be and should not be used by"

"610","PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION PURSUANT TO RULE 12b-1"
"611","OF"
"612","THE GAMCO GROWTH FUND"
"613","   WHEREAS, THE GAMCO GROWTH FUND, a Massachusetts Business Trust"
"614","(the Fund), engages in business as an open-end management"
"615","investment company and is registered as such under the Investment"
"616","Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Act);"
"617","WHEREAS, the Fund has issued and is authorized to issue common"
"618","shares of beneficial interest (Shares);"
"619","   WHEREAS, G.distributors, LLC (the Distributor) presently"
"620","serves as the principal distributor of the Shares pursuant to the"
"621","distribution agreement between the Fund and the Distributor, which"
"622","distribution agreement has been duly approved by the Board of"
"623","Trustees of the Fund (the Board), in accordance with the"
"624","requirements of the Act (the Distribution Agreement);"
"625","   WHEREAS, the Fund has established and plans to offer Shares"
"626","denominated as Class T Shares (the Class T Shares), pursuant to"
"627","Rule 18f-3 under the Act that permits the Fund to implement a"
"628","multiple distribution system providing investors with the option"
"629","of purchasing Shares of various classes;"
"630","   WHEREAS, the Board as a whole, and the trustees who are not"
"631","interested persons of the Fund (as defined in the Act) and who"
"632","have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of"
"633","the Plan or any agreements related to the Plan (the Disinterested
Trustees), have determined, after review of all information and"
"634","consideration of all pertinent facts reasonably necessary to an"
"635","informed determination, that it would be desirable to adopt a plan"
"636","of distribution for the Class T Shares and that, in the exercise"
"637","of reasonable business judgment and in light of their fiduciary"
"638","duties, that there is a reasonable likelihood that a plan of"
"639","distribution containing the terms set forth herein (the Plan)"
"640","will benefit the Fund and the shareholders of the Class T Shares,"
"641","and have accordingly approved the Plan by votes cast in person at"
"642","a meeting called for the purpose of voting on the Plan; and"
"643","   WHEREAS, this Plan governs the Class T Shares and does not"
"644","relate to any class of Shares which may be offered and sold by"
"645","the Fund other than the Class T Shares."
"646","    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the Fund"
"647","hereby adopts the Plan in accordance with Rule 12b-1 under the"
"648","Act on the following terms and conditions:"
"649","    1.	In consideration of the services to be provided, and the"
"650","expenses to be incurred, by the Distributor pursuant to the"
"651","Distribution Agreement, the Fund will pay to the Distributor as"
"652","distribution payments (the Payments) in connection with the"
"653","distribution of Class T Shares an aggregate amount at a rate of"
"654","..25% per year of the average daily net assets of the Class T"
"655","Shares. Such Payments shall be accrued daily and paid monthly in"
"656","arrears or shall be accrued and paid at such other intervals as"
"657","the Board shall determine. The Fund's obligation hereunder shall"
"658","be limited to the assets of the Class T Shares and shall not"
"659","constitute an obligation of the Fund except out of such assets"
"660","and shall not constitute an obligation of any shareholder of the"
"661","Fund."
"662","    2.	It is understood that the Payments made by the Fund"
"663","under this"
"664","Plan will be used by the Distributor for the purpose of financing"
"665","or assisting in the financing of any activity which is primarily"
"666","intended to result in the sale of Class T Shares. The scope of"
"667","the foregoing shall be interpreted by the Board, whose decision"
"668","shall be conclusive except to the extent it contravenes"
"669","established legal authority. Without in any way limiting the"
"670","discretion of the Board, the following activities are hereby"
"671","declared to be primarily intended to result in the sale of Class"
"672","T Shares: advertising the Class T Shares or the Fund's investment"
"673","adviser's mutual fund activities; compensating underwriters,"
"674","dealers, brokers, banks and other selling entities (including the"
"675","Distributor and its affiliates) and sales and marketing personnel"
"676","of any of them for sales of Class T Shares, whether in a lump sum"
"677","or on a continuous, periodic, contingent, deferred or other"
"678","basis; compensating underwriters, dealers, brokers, banks and"
"679","other servicing entities and servicing personnel (including the"
"680","Fund's investment adviser and its personnel) of any of them for"
"681","providing services to shareholders of the Fund relating to their"
"682","investment in the Class T Shares, including assistance in"
"683","connection with inquiries relating to shareholder accounts; the"
"684","production and dissemination of prospectuses (including"
"685","statements of additional information) of the Fund and the"
"686","preparation, production and dissemination of sales, marketing and"
"687","shareholder servicing materials; and the ordinary or capital"
"688","expenses, such as equipment, rent, fixtures, salaries, bonuses,"
"689","reporting and recordkeeping and third party consultancy or"
"690","similar expenses relating to any activity for which Payment is"
"691","authorized by the Board; and the financing of any activity for"
"692","which Payment is authorized by the Board; and profit to the"
"693","Distributor and its affiliates arising out of their provision of"
"694","shareholder services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Plan"
"695","does not require the Distributor or any of its affiliates to"
"696","perform any specific type or level of distribution activities or"
"697","shareholder services or to incur any specific level of expenses"
"698","for activities covered by this Section 2. In addition, Payments"
"699","made in a particular year shall not be refundable whether or not"
"700","such Payments exceed the expenses incurred for that year pursuant"
"701","to this Section 2."
"702","    3.	The Fund is hereby authorized and directed to enter into"
"703","appropriate written agreements with the Distributor and each"
"704","other person to whom the Fund intends to make any Payment, and"
"705","the Distributor is hereby authorized and directed to enter into"
"706","appropriate written agreements with each person to whom the"
"707","Distributor intends to make any payments in the nature of a"
"708","Payment. The foregoing requirement is not intended to apply to any"
"709","agreement or arrangement with respect to which the party to whom"
"710","payment is to be made does not have the purpose set forth in"
"711","Section 2 above (such as the printer in the case of the printing"
"712","of a prospectus or a newspaper in the case of an advertisement)"
"713","unless the Board determines that such an agreement or arrangement"
"714","should be treated as a related agreement for purposes of Rule"
"715","12b-1 under the Act."
"716","    4.	Each agreement required to be in writing by Section 3 must"
"717","contain the provisions required by Rule 12b-1 under the Act and"
"718","must be approved by a majority of the Board (Board Approval) and"
"719","by a majority of the Disinterested Trustees (Disinterested
Trustee Approval), by vote cast in person at a meeting called for"
"720","the purposes of voting on such agreement. All determinations or"
"721","authorizations of the Board hereunder shall be made by Board"
"722","Approval and Disinterested Trustee Approval."
"723","    5.	The officers, investment adviser or Distributor of the Fund,"
"724","as appropriate, shall provide to the Board and the Board shall"
"725","review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts"
"726","expended pursuant to this Plan and the purposes for which such"
"727","Payments were made."
"728","    6.	To the extent any activity is covered by Section 2 and is"
"729","also an activity which the Fund may pay for on behalf of the"
"730","Class T Shares without regard to the existence or terms and"
"731","conditions of a plan of distribution under Rule 12b-1 of the"
"732","Act, this Plan shall not be construed to prevent or restrict the"
"733","Fund from paying such amounts outside of this Plan and without"
"734","limitation hereby and without such payments being included in"
"735","calculation of Payments subject to the limitation set forth in"
"736","Section 1."
"737","    7.	This Plan may not be amended in any material respect without"
"738","Board Approval and Disinterested Trustee Approval and may not be"
"739","amended to increase the maximum level of Payments permitted"
"740","hereunder without such approvals and further approval by a vote of"
"741","at least a majority of the Class T Shares. This Plan may continue"
"742","in effect for longer than one year after its adoption only as long"
"743","as such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by"
"744","Board Approval and by Disinterested Trustee Approval."
"745","    8.	This Plan may be terminated at any time by a vote of the"
"746","Disinterested Trustees, cast in person at a meeting called for"
"747","the purposes of voting on such termination, or by a vote of at"
"748","least a majority of the Class T Shares."
"749","    9.	For purposes of this Plan the terms interested person and"
"750","related agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in"
"751","the Act and the rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange"
"752","Commission thereunder and the term vote of a majority of the
Class T Shares shall mean the vote, at the annual or a special"
"753","meeting of the holders of the Class T Shares duly called, (a) of"
"754","67% or more of the Class T Shares present at such meeting, if the"
"755","holders of more than 50% of the Class T Shares outstanding on the"
"756","record date for such meeting are present or represented by proxy"
"757","or, if less, (b) more than 50% of the Class T Shares outstanding"
