"824","SUB-ITEM 77E:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"825","Since February 2004,"
"826","Federated and related"
"827","entities (collectively, Federated)"
"828"," have been named as defendants in"
"829","several lawsuits that"
"830","are now pending in the"
"831","United States District"
"832","Court for the Western"
"833","District of Pennsylvania. These"
"834","lawsuits have been"
"835","consolidated into a single"
"836","action alleging excessive"
"837","advisory fees involving one"
"838","of the Federated-"
"839","sponsored mutual funds (Funds)."
"840","     Federated and its counsel"
"841","have been defending this"
"842","litigation. Additional"
"843","lawsuits based upon similar"
"844","allegations may"
"845","be filed in the future."
"846","The potential impact of"
"847","these lawsuits, all of which"
"848","seek monetary damages,"
"849","attorneys' fees and"
"850","expenses, and future potential"
"851","similar suits is uncertain."
"852","Although we do not believe"
"853","that these lawsuits will have a"
"854","material adverse effect on"
"855","the Funds, there can be no"
"856","assurance that these suits,"
"857","ongoing adverse publicity and/or other"
"858","developments resulting from"
"859","the allegations in these matters"
"860","will not result in increased"
"861","redemptions, or reduced sales, of"
"862","shares of the Funds or other"
"863","adverse consequences for the Funds."

"871","Report of Independent"
"872","Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"873","To the Shareholders and"
"874","Board of Trustees of"
"875","Federated Stock and Bond Fund"
"876","In planning and performing"
"877","our audit of the financial"
"878","statements of Federated Stock"
"879"," and Bond"
"880","Fund (the Fund) as of and"
"881","for the year ended November 30, 2010,"
"882","in accordance with the"
"883","standards of the Public"
"884","Company Accounting Oversight"
"885","Board (United States), we considered"
"886"," the"
"887","Fund's internal control over"
"888","financial reporting, including"
"889","controls over safeguarding securities,"
"890","as a basis for designing our"
"891","auditing procedures for the"
"892","purpose of expressing our"
"893","opinion on the"
"894","financial statements and to"
"895","comply with the requirements"
"896","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"897","of expressing an opinion on"
"898","the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"899","internal control over financial"
"900","reporting. Accordingly, we"
"901"," express no such opinion."
"902","Management of the Fund is"
"903","responsible for establishing"
"904","and maintaining effective internal"
"905"," control"
"906","over financial reporting."
"907","In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"908","estimates and judgments by management"
"909","are required to assess the expected"
"910","benefits and related costs"
"911","of controls. A company's internal"
"912","control over financial reporting is"
"913"," a process designed to provide"
"914","reasonable"
"915","assurance regarding"
"916","the reliability of financial reporting"
"917","and the preparation of financial"
"918","statements"
"919","for external"
"920","purposes in accordance with generally"
"921","accepted accounting principles."
"922","A company's"
"923","internal"
"924","control over financial reporting"
"925","includes those policies and procedures"
"926","that (1) pertain to the"
"927","maintenance of records that, in"
"928","reasonable detail, accurately and"
"929","fairly reflect the transactions and"
"930","dispositions of the assets of the"
"931","company; (2) provide reasonable"
"932","assurance that transactions are"
"933","recorded as necessary to permit"
"934","preparation of financial statements"
"935"," in accordance with generally"
"936","accepted accounting principles,"
"937","and that receipts and expenditures"
"938"," of the company are being made"
"939","in accordance with authorizations"
"940","of management and directors of the"
"941","company; and (3) provide"
"942","reasonable assurance regarding"
"943","prevention or timely detection of"
"944","the unauthorized acquisition,"
"945","use, or disposition of the company's"
"946","assets that could have a material"
"947","affect on the financial"
"948","statements."
"949","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"950","internal control over financial reporting"
"951"," may not prevent or"
"952","detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"953","of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"954","future periods are"
"955","subject to the risk that controls may"
"956","become inadequate because of changes"
"957","in conditions, or that"
"958","the degree of compliance with the"
"959","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"960","A deficiency in internal control"
"961","over financial reporting exists"
"962","when the design or operation of a"
"963","control does not allow management"
"964","or employees, in the normal course"
"965","of performing their"
"966","assigned functions, to prevent or"
"967","detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"968","A material weakness is a"
"969","deficiency, or a combination of"
"970","deficiencies, in internal control"
"971","over financial reporting, such that"
"972","there is a reasonable possibility"
"973","that a material misstatement of the"
"974","Fund's annual or interim"
"975","financial statements will not be"
"976"," prevented or detected on a timely"
"977"," basis."
"978","Our consideration of the Fund's"
"979","internal control over financial"
"980","reporting was for the limited"
"981","purpose described in the first"
"982"," paragraph and would not necessarily"
"983","disclose all deficiencies in"
"984","internal control that might be"
"985","material weaknesses under standards"
"986","established by the Public"
"987","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"988","(United States). However, we"
"989","noted no deficiencies in the"
"990","Fund's internal control over"
"991","financial reporting and its"
"992","operation, including controls"
"993","over"
"994","safeguarding securities that"
"995","we consider to be a material"
"996","weakness as defined above as of"
"997","November 30, 2010."
"998","This report is intended solely"
"999","for the information and use of"
"1000","management and the Board of"
"1001","Trustees of Federated Stock and"
"1002","Bond Fund and the Securities and"
