"510","Legg Mason Maryland Tax-Free Income Trust"
"511","       This SUBADVISORY AGREEMENT"
"512","(?Agreement?) is made as of the 16th day of"
"513","November, 2012 by and between Legg Mason"
"514","Partners Fund Advisor, LLC, a Delaware limited"
"515","liability company (the ?Manager?), and Western"
"516","Asset Management Company, a California"
"517","corporation (the ?Subadviser?)."
"518","       WHEREAS, the Manager has been retained"
"519","by Legg Mason Tax-Free Income Fund (the ?Trust?),"
"520","a registered management investment company under"
"521","the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended"
"522","(the ?1940 Act?) to provide investment advisory,"
"523","management, and administrative services to the Trust"
"524","with respect to a series of the Trust; and"
"525","WHEREAS, the Manager wishes to engage the"
"526","Subadviser to provide certain investment advisory"
"527","services to the Trust with respect to the series of the"
"528","Trust designated as the Legg Mason Maryland Tax-"
"529","Free Income Trust (the ?Fund?), and the Subadviser"
"530","is willing to furnish such services on the terms and"
"531","conditions hereinafter set forth;"
"532","       NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the"
"533","promises and mutual covenants herein contained, it is"
"534","agreed as follows:"
"535","       1.             In accordance with and subject to"
"536","the Investment Advisory and Management"
"537","Agreement between the Fund and the Manager (the"
"538","?Management Agreement?), the Manager hereby"
"539","appoints the Subadviser to act as Subadviser with"
"540","respect to the Fund for the period and on the terms"
"541","set forth in this Agreement. The Subadviser accepts"
"542","such appointment and agrees to render the services"
"543","herein set forth, for the compensation herein"
"544","provided."
"545","       2.             The Manager shall cause the"
"546","Subadviser to be kept fully informed at all times with"
"547","regard to the securities owned by the Fund, its funds"
"548","available, or to become available, for investment, and"
"549","generally as to the condition of the Fund?s affairs."
"550","Manager shall furnish the Subadviser with such other"
"551","documents and information with regard to the Fund?s"
"552","affairs as the Subadviser may from time to time"
"553","reasonably request."
"554","       3.             (a)           Subject to the supervision"
"555","of the Fund?s Board of Trustees (the ?Board?) and"
"556","the Manager, Subadviser shall regularly provide the"
"557","Fund with respect to such portion of the Fund?s"
"558","assets as shall be allocated to the Subadviser by the"
"559","Manager from time to time (the ?Allocated Assets?)"
"560","with investment research, advice, management and"
"561","supervision and shall furnish a continuous"
"562","investment program for the Allocated Assets"
"563","consistent with the Fund?s investment objectives,"
"564","policies and restrictions, as stated in the Fund?s"
"565","Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information."
"566","The Subadviser shall, with respect to the Allocated"
"567","Assets, determine from time to time what securities"
"568","and other investments will be purchased (including,"
"569","as permitted in accordance with this paragraph, swap"
"570","agreements, options and futures), retained, sold or"
"571","exchanged by the Fund and what portion of the"
"572","Allocated Assets will be held in the various securities"
"573","and other investments in which the Fund invests, and"
"574","shall implement those decisions (including the"
"575","execution of investment documentation), all subject to"
"576","the provisions of the Fund?s Trust Instrument and"
"577","By-Laws (collectively, the ?Governing Documents?),"
"578","the 1940 Act, and the applicable rules and regulations"
"579","promulgated thereunder by the Securities and"
"580","Exchange Commission (the ?SEC?) and interpretive"
"581","guidance issued thereunder by the SEC staff and any"
"582","other applicable federal and state law, as well as the"
"583","investment objectives, policies and restrictions of the"
"584","Fund referred to above, and any other specific"
"585","policies adopted by the Board and disclosed to the"
"586","Subadviser. The Subadviser is authorized as the"
"587","agent of the Fund to give instructions with respect to"
"588","the Allocated Assets to the custodian of the Fund as"
"589","to deliveries of securities and other investments and"
"590","payments of cash for the account of the Fund."
"591","Subject to applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, the"
"592","investment program to be provided hereunder may"
"593","entail the investment of all or substantially all of the"
"594","assets of the Fund in one or more investment"
"595","companies. The Subadviser will place orders pursuant"
"596","to its investment determinations for the Fund either"
"597","directly with the issuer or with any broker or dealer,"
"598","foreign currency dealer, futures commission merchant"
"599","or others selected by it. In connection with the"
"600","selection of such brokers or dealers and the placing of"
"601","such orders, subject to applicable law, brokers or"
"602","dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage"
"603","and research services (as those terms are defined in"
"604","Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,"
"605","as amended (the ?Exchange Act?)) to the Fund and/or"
"606","the other accounts over which the Subadviser or its"
"607","affiliates exercise investment discretion. The"
"608","Subadviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer"
"609","who provides such brokerage and research services a"
"610","commission for executing a portfolio transaction for"
"611","the Fund which is in excess of the amount of"
"612","commission another broker or dealer would have"
"613","charged for effecting that transaction if the"
"614","Subadviser determines in good faith that such amount"
"615","of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of"
"616","the brokerage and research services provided by such"
"617","broker or dealer. This determination may be viewed in"
"618","terms of either that particular transaction or the"
"619","overall responsibilities which the Subadviser and its"
"620","affiliates have with respect to accounts over which"
"621","they exercise investment discretion. The Board may"
"622","adopt policies and procedures that modify and restrict"
"623","the Subadviser?s authority regarding the execution of"
"624","the Fund?s portfolio transactions provided herein."
"625","The Subadviser shall exercise voting rights, rights to"
"626","consent to corporate action and any other rights"
"627","pertaining to the Allocated Assets subject to such"
"628","direction as the Board may provide, and shall perform"
"629","such other functions of investment management and"
"630","supervision as may be directed by the Board."
"631","       (b)           The Fund hereby authorizes any"
"632","entity or person associated with the Subadviser"
"633","which is a member of a national securities exchange to"
"634","effect any transaction on the exchange for the"
"635","account of the Fund which is permitted by"
"636","Section 11(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 11a2-"
"637","2(T) thereunder, and the Fund hereby consents to the"
"638","retention of compensation for such transactions in"
"639","accordance with Rule 11a2-2(T)(a)(2)(iv)."
"640","Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Subadviser"
"641","agrees that it will not deal with itself, or with members"
"642","of the Board or any principal underwriter of the Fund,"
"643","as principals or agents in making purchases or sales"
"644","of securities or other property for the account of the"
"645","Fund, nor will it purchase any securities from an"
"646","underwriting or selling group in which the Subadviser"
"647","or its affiliates is participating, or arrange for"
"648","purchases and sales of securities between the Fund"
"649","and another account advised by the Subadviser or its"
"650","affiliates, except in each case as permitted by the 1940"
"651","Act and in accordance with such policies and"
"652","procedures as may be adopted by the Fund from time"
"653","to time, and will comply with all other provisions of"
"654","the Governing Documents and the Fund?s Prospectus"
"655","and Statement of Additional Information relative to"
"656","the Subadviser and its directors and officers."
"657","       4.             The Subadviser may delegate to"
"658","any other one or more companies that the Subadviser"
"659","controls, is controlled by, or is under common control"
"660","with, or to specified employees of any such"
"661","companies, certain of the Subadviser?s duties under"
"662","this Agreement, provided in each case the Subadviser"
"663","will supervise the activities of each such entity or"
"664","employees thereof, that such delegation will not"
"665","relieve the Subadviser of any of its duties or"
"666","obligations under this Agreement and provided"
"667","further that any such arrangements are entered into in"
"668","accordance with all applicable requirements of the"
"669","1940 Act."
"670","       5.             The Subadviser agrees that it will"
"671","keep records relating to its services hereunder in"
"672","accordance with all applicable laws, and in compliance"
"673","with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940"
"674","Act, the Subadviser hereby agrees that any records"
"675","that it maintains for the Fund are the property of the"
"676","Fund, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the"
"677","Fund any of such records upon the Fund?s request."
"678","The Subadviser further agrees to arrange for the"
"679","preservation of the records required to be maintained"
"680","by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act for the periods"
"681","prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act."
"682","       6.             (a)           The Subadviser, at its"
"683","expense, shall supply the Board, the officers of the"
"684","Fund, and the Manager with all information and"
"685","reports reasonably required by them and reasonably"
"686","available to the Subadviser relating to the services"
"687","provided by the Subadviser hereunder."
"688","       (b)           The Subadviser shall bear all"
"689","expenses, and shall furnish all necessary services,"
"690","facilities and personnel, in connection with its"
"691","responsibilities under this Agreement. Other than as"
"692","herein specifically indicated, the Subadviser shall not"
"693","be responsible for the Fund?s expenses, including,"

"704","registrars, independent pricing vendors or other"
"705","agents; legal expenses; loan commitment fees;"

"707","relating to the issuing and redemption or repurchase"
"708","of the Fund?s shares and servicing shareholder"
"709","accounts; expenses of registering and qualifying the"

"711","state law; expenses of preparing, setting in print,"
"712","printing and distributing prospectuses and"
"713","statements of additional information and any"
"714","supplements thereto, reports, proxy statements,"
"715","notices and dividends to the Fund?s shareholders;"
"716","costs of stationery; website costs; costs of meetings"
"717","of the Board or any committee thereof, meetings of"

"723","and its officers, Board members and employees;"
"724","litigation expenses and any non-recurring or"
"725","extraordinary expenses as may arise, including,"

"727","proceedings to which the Fund is a party and the"
"728","legal obligation which the Fund may have to"
"729","indemnify the Fund?s Board members and officers"
"730","with respect thereto."
"731","       7.             No member of the Board, officer or"
"732","employee of the Fund shall receive from the Fund any"
"733","salary or other compensation as such member of the"
"734","Board, officer or employee while he is at the same time"
"735","a director, officer, or employee of the Subadviser or"
"736","any affiliated company of the Subadviser, except as"
"737","the Board may decide. This paragraph shall not apply"
"738","to Board members, executive committee members,"
"739","consultants and other persons who are not regular"
"740","members of the Subadviser?s or any affiliated"
"741","company?s staff."
"742","       8.             As compensation for the services"
"743","performed by the Subadviser, including the services"
"744","of any consultants retained by the Subadviser, the"
"745","Manager shall pay the Subadviser out of the"
"746","management fee it receives with respect to the Fund,"
"747","and only to the extent thereof, as promptly as"
"748","possible after the last day of each month, 0.02% of the"
"749","portion of the Fund's average daily net assets"
"750","allocated to the Subadviser for the management of"
"751","cash and other short-term instruments, net of expense"
"752","waivers and reimbursements. Such fee shall be paid to"
"753","the Subadviser by the Manager out of the fee it"
"754","receives from the Fund. The first payment of the fee"
"755","shall be made as promptly as possible at the end of"
"756","the month succeeding the effective date of this"
"757","Agreement, and shall constitute a full payment of the"
"758","fee due the Subadviser for all services prior to that"
"759","date. If this Agreement is terminated as of any date"
"760","not the last day of a month, such fee shall be paid as"
"761","promptly as possible after such date of termination,"
"762","shall be based on the net assets of the Fund or, if"
"763","less, the portion thereof comprising the Allocated"
"764","Assets in that period from the beginning of such"
"765","month to such date of termination, and shall be"
"766","prorated by the ratio that the number of business"
"767","days in such period bears to the number of business"
"768","days in such month. The net assets of the Fund or the"
"769","portion thereof comprising the Allocated Assets shall"
"770","in all cases be based only on business days and be"

"772","business of the New York Stock Exchange, or such"

"774","       9.             The Subadviser assumes no"
"775","responsibility under this Agreement other than to"
"776","render the services called for hereunder, in good faith,"
"777","and shall not be liable for any error of judgment or"
"778","mistake of law, or for any loss arising out of any"
"779","investment or for any act or omission in the execution"
"780","of securities transactions for the Fund, provided that"
"781","nothing in this Agreement shall protect the"
"782","Subadviser against any liability to the Manager or the"
"783","Fund to which the Subadviser would otherwise be"
"784","subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or"
"785","gross negligence in the performance of its duties or"
"786","by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations"
"787","and duties hereunder. As used in this Section 9, the"
"788","term ?Subadviser? shall include any affiliates of the"
"789","Subadviser performing services for the Fund"
"790","contemplated hereby and the partners, shareholders,"

"796","member, officer, or employee of the Fund, to engage"
"797","in any other business or to devote his time and"
"798","attention in part to the management or other aspects"
"799","of any other business, whether of a similar nature or a"
"800","dissimilar nature, nor to limit or restrict the right of the"
"801","Subadviser to engage in any other business or to"
"802","render services of any kind, including investment"
"803","advisory and management services, to any other"
"804","fund, firm, individual or association. If the purchase or"
"805","sale of securities consistent with the investment"
"806","policies of the Fund or one or more other accounts of"
"807","the Subadviser is considered at or about the same"
"808","time, transactions in such securities will be allocated"
"809","among the accounts in a manner deemed equitable by"
"810","the Subadviser. Such transactions may be combined,"
"811","in accordance with applicable laws and regulations,"
"812","and consistent with the Subadviser?s policies and"
"813","procedures as presented to the Board from time to"
"814","time."
"815","       11.           For the purposes of this"
"816","Agreement, the Fund?s ?net assets? shall be its total"
"817","assets minus its liabilities and the terms"
"818","?assignment,? ?interested person,? and ?majority of"
"819","the outstanding voting securities? shall have the"
"820","meanings given to them by Section 2(a) of the 1940"
"821","Act, subject to such exemptions as may be granted by"
"822","the SEC by any rule, regulation or order."
"823","       12.           This Agreement will become"
"824","effective with respect to the Fund as of the 16th day"
"825","of November, 2012, provided that it shall have been"
"826","approved by the Fund?s Board and, if so required by"
"827","the 1940 Act, by the shareholders of the Fund in"
"828","accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act"
"829","and, unless sooner terminated as provided herein, will"
"830","continue in effect through November 30, 2014."
"831","Thereafter, if not terminated, this Agreement shall"
"832","continue in effect with respect to the Fund, so long as"
"833","such continuance is specifically approved at least"
"834","annually (i) by the Board or (ii) by a vote of a majority"
"835","of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund,"
"836","provided that in either event the continuance is also"
"837","approved by a majority of the Board members who are"
"838","not interested persons of any party to this"
"839","Agreement, by vote cast in person at a meeting called"
"840","for the purpose of voting on such approval."
"841","       13.           This Agreement is terminable with"
"842","respect to the Fund without penalty by the Board or"
"843","by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting"
"844","securities of the Fund, in each case on not more than"
"845","60 days? nor less than 30 days? written notice to the"
"846","Subadviser, or by the Subadviser upon not less than"
"847","90 days? written notice to the Fund and the Manager,"

"849","consent of the Manager and the Subadviser. This"
"850","Agreement shall terminate automatically in the event"
"851","of its assignment."
"852","       14.           The Subadviser agrees that for any"
"853","claim by it against the Fund in connection with this"
"854","Agreement or the services rendered under this"
"855","Agreement, it shall look only to assets of the Fund for"
"856","satisfaction and that it shall have no claim against the"
"857","assets of any other portfolios of the Trust."
"858","       15.           No provision of this Agreement"
"859","may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated"
"860","orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by"
"861","the party against which enforcement of the change,"
"862","waiver, discharge or termination is sought, and no"
"863","material amendment of the Agreement shall be"
"864","effective until approved, if so required by the 1940"

"866","outstanding voting securities."
"867","       16.           This Agreement, and any"

"1020","To the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Tax-"
"1021","Free Income Fund and to the Shareholders of"
"1022","Legg Mason Investment Counsel Maryland"
"1023","Tax-Free Income Trust:"
"1024","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"1025","financial statements of Legg Mason"
"1026","Investment Counsel Maryland Tax-Free"
"1027","Income Trust (comprising Legg Mason Tax-"
"1028","Free Income Fund, the Company) as of and"
"1029","for the year ended March 31, 2013, in"
"1030","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1031","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1032","(United States), we considered the"
"1033","Company's internal control over financial"
"1034","reporting, including controls over"
"1035","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1036","designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1037","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1038","financial statements and to comply with the"
"1039","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1040","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1041","effectiveness of the Company's internal"
"1042","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"1043","we do not express an opinion on the"
"1044","effectiveness of the Company's internal"
"1045","control over financial reporting."
"1046","The management of the Company is"
"1047","responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1048","effective internal control over financial"
"1049","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1050","estimates and judgments by management"
"1051","are required to assess the expected benefits"
"1052","and related costs of controls.  A company's"
"1053","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1054","process designed to provide reasonable"
"1055","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1056","financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1057","financial statements for external purposes in"
"1058","accordance with generally accepted"
"1059","accounting principles.  A company's internal"
"1060","control over financial reporting includes"
"1061","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"1062","to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1063","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1064","reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1065","the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1066","reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1067","recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"1068","of financial statements in accordance with"
"1069","generally accepted accounting principles,"
"1070","and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1071","company are being made only in accordance"
"1072","with authorizations of management and"
"1073","trustees of the company; and (3)  provide"
"1074","reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1075","or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1076","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"1077","assets that could have a material effect on"
"1078","the financial statements."
"1079","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1080","control over financial reporting may not"
"1081","prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"1082","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"1083","to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1084","controls may become inadequate because of"
"1085","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1086","compliance with the policies or procedures"
"1087","may deteriorate."
"1088","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1089","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"1090","of a control does not allow management or"
"1091","employees, in the normal course of"
"1092","performing their assigned functions, to"
"1093","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"1094","basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"1095","a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1096","control over financial reporting, such that"
"1097","there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1098","material misstatement of the Company's"
"1099","annual or interim financial statements will"
"1100","not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"1101","basis."
"1102","Our consideration of the Company's internal"
"1103","control over financial reporting was for the"
"1104","limited purpose described in the first"
"1105","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1106","all deficiencies in internal control over"
"1107","financial reporting that might be material"
"1108","weaknesses under standards established by"
"1109","the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1110","Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"1111","no deficiencies in the Company's internal"
"1112","control over financial reporting and its"
"1113","operation, including controls over"
"1114","safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"1115","be material weaknesses as defined above as"
"1116","of March 31, 2013."
