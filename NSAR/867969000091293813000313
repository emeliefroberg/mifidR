"814","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"815","To the Board of Trustees of MFS Institutional Trust and the Shareholders of MFS"
"816","Institutional International Equity Fund and MFS Institutional Large Cap Value"
"817","Fund:"
"818","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of MFS"
"819","Institutional International Equity Fund and MFS Institutional Large Cap Value"
"820","Fund (the Funds) (each a portfolio comprising MFS Institutional Trust) as of"
"821","and for the year ended June 30, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the"
"822","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"823","Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"824","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"825","the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements and to comply"
"826","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"827","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"828","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"829","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"830","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"831","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"832","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"833","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"834","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"835","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"836","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"837","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"838","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"839","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"840","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"841","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"842","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"843","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"844","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"845","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"846","a material effect on the financial statements."
"847","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"848","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"849","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"850","inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance"
"851","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"852","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"853","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"854","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"855","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"856","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"857","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"858","fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"859","on a timely basis."
"860","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"861","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"862","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"863","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"864","Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"865","Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"866","controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"867","weakness, as defined above, as of June 30, 2013."
"868","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"869","Board of Trustees of MFS Institutional Trust and the Securities and Exchange"
"870","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"871","these specified parties."
