"2924","LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Adviser), and"
"2925","Driehaus Mutual Funds (the Trust), on behalf of the Driehaus"

"2927","      WHEREAS, the Trust is a Delaware statutory trust, and is"
"2928","registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended"
"2929","(the 1940 Act), as an open-end management company of the"

"2936","      WHEREAS, the Trust and the Adviser have determined that it"
"2937","is appropriate and in the best interests of the Fund and its"
"2938","shareholders to maintain the expenses of each class of the Fund"
"2939","at a level below the level to which such class of the Fund may"
"2940","otherwise be subject;"
"2941","      NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:"
"2942","1.	EXPENSE LIMITATION."
"2943","      1.1	Applicable Expense Limit.  To the extent that the"
"2944","ordinary operating expenses incurred by each class of the Fund"
"2945","for the three-year period beginning on the effective date listed"
"2946","above (the Expense Limit Period), including but not limited to"

Expenses), exceed the Operating Expense Limit, as defined in"
"2952","Section 1.2 below, such excess amount (the Excess Amount)"
"2953","shall be the liability of the Adviser to the extent set forth in"
"2954","this Agreement."
"2955","      1.2	Operating Expense Limit.  The Operating Expense Limit"
"2956","with respect to the Investor class shares of the Fund shall be"
"2957","1.20% (annualized) of the average daily net assets of the Fund"
"2958","attributable to such class.  The Operating Expense Limit with"
"2959","respect to the Institutional class shares of the Fund shall be"
"2960","0.95% (annualized) of the average daily net assets of the Fund"
"2961","attributable to such class."
"2962","      1.3	Duration of Operating Expense Limit.  The Operating"
"2963","Expense Limit with respect to each class of the Fund shall"
"2964","remain in effect during the term of this Agreement."
"2965","      1.4	Method of Computation.  To determine the Adviser's"
"2966","obligation with respect to the Excess Amount, each day the Fund"
"2967","Operating Expenses for each class of the Fund shall be"
"2968","annualized.  If the annualized Fund Operating Expenses for any"
"2969","day for any class of the Fund exceed the Operating Expense Limit"
"2970","of the respective class of the Fund, the Adviser shall waive or"
"2971","reduce its investment advisory fee or absorb the other Fund"
"2972","expenses applicable to such class in an amount sufficient to pay"
"2973","that day's Excess Amount.  The Trust may offset amounts owed to"
"2974","the Fund pursuant to this Agreement against the advisory fee"
"2975","payable to the Adviser.  Furthermore, to the extent that the"
"2976","Excess Amount exceeds such waived or reduced investment advisory"
"2977","fees, the Adviser may voluntarily reimburse the Fund for any"
"2978","operating expenses."
"2979","2.	REIMBURSEMENT OF FEE WAIVERS AND EXPENSE"
"2980","REIMBURSEMENTS."
"2981","      If on any day during which the Advisory Agreement is in"
"2982","effect, the estimated annualized Fund Operating Expenses for"
"2983","that day are less than the Operating Expense Limit for either"
"2984","class, the Adviser shall be entitled to reimbursement by such"
"2985","class of the investment advisory fees waived or reduced, and any"
"2986","other expense reimbursements or similar payments remitted by the"
"2987","Adviser to the Fund pursuant to Section 1 hereof (the"
"2988","Reimbursement Amount) during the Expense Limit Period to the"
"2989","extent that the Fund's annualized Operating Expenses plus the"
"2990","amount so reimbursed equals, for such day, the Operating Expense"
"2991","Limit for such class, provided that such amount paid to the"
"2992","Adviser will in no event exceed the total Reimbursement Amount"
"2993","and will not include any amounts previously reimbursed."
"2994","3.	TERM AND TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT."
"2995","      This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of"
"2996","termination of the Advisory Agreement or on expiration of the"
"2997","Expense Limit Period.  The obligation of the Adviser under"
"2998","Section 1 of this Agreement and of the Fund under Section 2 of"
"2999","this Agreement shall survive the termination of the Agreement"
"3000","solely as to expenses and obligations incurred prior to the date"

"3075","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"3076","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"3077","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"3078","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"3079","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"3080","express no such opinion."
"3081","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"3082","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"3083","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"3084","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"3085","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal"
"3086","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"3087","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"3088","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"3089","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"3090","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"3091","control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"3092","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"3093","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"3094","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"3095","the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"3096","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"3097","preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"3098","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"3099","and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"3100","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"3101","of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"3102","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"3103","use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a"
"3104","material effect on the financial statements."
"3105","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3106","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"3107","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"3108","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"3109","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"3110","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"3111","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3112","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"3113","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"3114","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"3115","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3116","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"3117","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"3118","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"3119","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"3120","company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"3121","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3122","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"3123","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"3124","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"3125","all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"3126","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"3127","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"3128","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal"
"3129","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"3130","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"3131","consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"3132","December 31, 2017."
"3133","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"3134","of management and the Board of Trustees of the Funds and"
"3135","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"3136","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"3137","specified parties."
