"1543","all times be subject to the control and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees."
"1544","</P>"
"1545","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(b)	Management Services.  The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for the performance by its affiliates"

"1563","to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as"
"1564","those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts"
"1565","over which the Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer"

"1568","Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"1569","research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular"
"1570","transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they"
"1571","exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to"

"1577","the Adviser as directors, officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and stockholders of the Adviser are or may be or"
"1578","become similarly interested in the Fund, and that the Adviser may be or become interested in the Fund as a shareholder or"
"1579","otherwise."
"1580","</P>"

"1583","the fee for that month shall be reduced proportionately on the basis of the number of business days during which it is in effect"
"1584","and the fee computed upon the average net assets for the business days it is so in effect for that month."

"1586","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	4.	The Adviser undertakes to pay all expenses involved in the operation of the Portfolio, including all expenses"
"1587","allocable at the Portfolio level, except the following: (i) transfer agent fees, Rule 12b-1 fees and other expenses allocable at"
"1588","the class level; (ii) interest and taxes; (iii) brokerage commissions and other costs in connection with the purchase or sale of"
"1589","securities and other investment instruments; (iv) fees and expenses of the Fund's Trustees other than those who are &quot;interested"

"1592","but may be received and retained by the Adviser or its affiliates. It is also understood that the Adviser and/or the Portfolio"
"1593","may, from time to time, allocate or reallocate expenses between the Portfolio and any class of the Portfolio."

"1595","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	5.	The services of the Adviser to the Portfolio are not to be deemed exclusive, the Adviser being free to render"
"1596","services to others and engage in other activities, provided, however, that such other services and activities do not, during the"
"1597","term of this Contract, interfere, in a material manner, with the Adviser's ability to meet all of its obligations with respect to"
"1598","rendering services to the Portfolio hereunder.  In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless"
"1599","disregard of obligations or duties hereunder on the part of the Adviser, the Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Portfolio or to any shareholder of the Portfolio for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services"
"1600","hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security or other investment instrument."
"1601","</P>"
"1602","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	6.	Subject to the prior written approval of the Trustees of the Trust, satisfaction of all applicable requirements under the 1940 Act, and such other terms and conditions as the Trustees may impose, the Adviser may appoint (and may from"
"1603","time to time remove) one or more unaffiliated persons as agent to perform any or all of the services specified hereunder and"
"1604","to carry out such provisions of this Agreement as the Adviser may from time to time direct, and may delegate to such unaffiliated persons the authority vested in the Adviser pursuant to this Agreement to the extent necessary to enable such persons to"
"1605","perform the services requested of such person by the Adviser, provided, however, that the appointment of any such agent"
"1606","shall not relieve the Adviser of any of its liabilities hereunder."
"1607","</P>"
"1608","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	7.	(a)	Subject to prior termination as provided in sub-paragraph (d) of this paragraph 7, this Contract shall"
"1609","continue in force until July 31, 2011 and indefinitely thereafter, but only so long as the continuance after such date"
"1610","shall be specifically approved at least annually by vote of the Trustees of the Fund or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Portfolio."
"1611","</P>"
"1612","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(b)	This Contract may be modified by mutual consent, such consent on the part of the Fund to be authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Portfolio."
"1613","</P>"
"1614","<P ALIGN=LEFT>		(c)	In addition to the requirements of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph 7, the terms of any"
"1615","continuance or modification of this Contract must have been approved by the vote of a majority of those Trustees of"
"1616","the Fund who are not parties to the Contract or interested persons of any such party, cast in person at a meeting called"
"1617","for the purpose of voting on such approval."
"1618","</P>"
"1619","<P ID=C__\desktop\MC_02-01-11.html.3 ALIGN=LEFT>		(d)	Either party hereto may, at any time on sixty (60) days' prior written notice to the other, terminate"
"1620","this Contract, without payment of any penalty, by action of its Trustees or Board of Directors, as the case may be, or"
"1621","with respect to the Portfolio by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Portfolio.  This Contract"
"1622","shall terminate automatically in the event of its assignment."
"1623","</P>"
"1624","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	8.	The Adviser is hereby expressly put on notice of the limitation of shareholder liability as set forth in the"
"1625","Fund's Declaration of Trust or other organizational document and agrees that the obligations assumed by the Fund pursuant to"
"1626","this Contract shall be limited in all cases to the Portfolio and its assets, and the Adviser shall not seek satisfaction of any such"
"1627","obligation from the shareholders or any shareholder of the Portfolio or any other Portfolios of the Fund.  In addition, the Adviser shall not seek satisfaction of any such obligations from the Trustees or any individual Trustee.  The Adviser understands"
"1628","that the rights and obligations of any Portfolio under the Declaration of Trust or other organizational document are separate"
"1629","and distinct from those of any and all other Portfolios."
"1630","</P>"
"1631","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	9.	This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of"
"1632","Massachusetts, without giving effect to the choice of laws provisions thereof."
"1633","</P>"
"1634","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	The terms &quot;vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities,&quot; &quot;assignment,&quot; and &quot;interested persons,&quot; when used"

"3295","<P align=center>____</P>"
"3296","<P>&nbsp;</P>"
"3297","<P>To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Fidelity Concord Street"
"3298","Trust:</P>"
"3299","<P></P>"
"3300","<P>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements Fidelity"
"3301","Concord Street Trust: Spartan Extended Market Index Fund, Spartan International"
"3302","Index Fund, Spartan Total Market Index Fund, and Spartan 500 Index Fund"
"3303","(collectively, the Trust) as of and for the year ended February 28, 2011, in"
"3304","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"3305","(United States), we considered the Trust's internal control over financial"
"3306","reporting, including control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"3307","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"3308","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"3309","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"3310","Trust's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not"
"3311","express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over"
"3312","financial reporting.</P>"
"3313","<P>The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3314","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"3315","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"3316","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"3317","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"3318","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"3319","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"3320","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"3321","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"3322","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"3323","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"3324","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"3325","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"3326","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Trust are being"
"3327","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"3328","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"3329","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a Trust's assets"
"3330","that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"3331","<P>Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3332","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"3333","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3334","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"3335","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"
"3336","<P></P>"
"3337","<P>&nbsp;</P>"
"3338","<P>&nbsp;</P>"
"3339","<P>&nbsp;</P>"
"3340","<P>&nbsp;</P>"
"3341","<P></P>"
"3342","<P></P>"
"3343","<P>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"3344","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
