"811","CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS"
"812","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"813","TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS"
"814","OF FENIMORE ASSET MANAGEMENT TRUST"
"815","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of FAM Value"
"816","Fund, FAM Equity-Income Fund and FAM Small Cap Fund, each a series of shares of"
"817","beneficial interest of Fenimore Asset Management Trust, as of and for the year"
"818","or period ended December 31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the"
"819","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"820","considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"821","control activities over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"822","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"823","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"824","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"825","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"826","The management of Fenimore Asset Management Trust is responsible for"
"827","establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"828","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"829","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"830","controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"831","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"832","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"833","accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of"
"834","America (GAAP). A company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"835","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"836","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"837","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"838","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"839","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"840","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"841","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"842","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"843","of a company's assets that could have material effect on the financial"
"844","statements."
"845","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may"
"846","not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"847","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"848","inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance"
"849","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"850","<PAGE>"
"851","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"852","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"853","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"854","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"855","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"856","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"857","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"858","on a timely basis."
"859","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"860","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"861","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"862","weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB. However, we noted no"
"863","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and their"
"864","operations, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"865","be material weaknesses as defined above, as of December 31, 2012."
"866","This report is intended solely for the information and use of the shareholders,"
"867","management, and the Board of Trustees of Fenimore Asset Management Trust, and"
"868","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not"
"869","be used by anyone other than these specified parties."
