"4012","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"4013","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Investment Funds (Invesco"
"4014","Investment Funds):"
"4015","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco"
"4016","International Total Return Fund, Invesco Premium Income Fund, Invesco Emerging"
"4017","Markets Local Currency Debt Fund, Invesco Balanced-Risk Allocation Fund,"
"4018","Invesco Balanced-Risk Commodity Strategy Fund, Invesco Global Markets Strategy"
"4019","Fund, Invesco Select Companies Fund, Invesco China Fund, Invesco Endeavor Fund,"
"4020","Invesco Global Health Care Fund, Invesco Emerging Markets Equity Fund, Invesco"
"4021","Developing Markets Fund and Invesco Pacific Growth Fund (hereafter referred to"
"4022","as the Funds) as of and for the year ended October 31, 2013 in accordance"
"4023","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"4024","States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"4025","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"4026","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"4027","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"4028","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"4029","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"4030","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"4031","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"4032","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"4033","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"4034","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"4035","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"4036","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"4037","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"4038","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"4039","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"4040","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"4041","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"4042","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"4043","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"4044","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"4045","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"4046","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"4047","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"4048","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"4049","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"4050","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"4051","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"4052","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"4053","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4054","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"4055","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"4056","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"4057","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"4058","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"4059","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"4060","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"4061","on a timely basis."
"4062","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"4063","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"4064","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"4065","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"4066","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"4067","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"4068","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"4069","be material weaknesses as defined above as of October 31, 2013."
"4070","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"4071","the Board of Trustees of AIM Investment Funds (Invesco Investment Funds) and"
"4072","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not"
"4073","be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"6090","                           PLAN OF RECAPITALIZATION"
"6091","   This PLAN OF RECAPITALIZATION (the Plan) is dated as of the 8th day of"
"6092","August, 2013, and has been adopted by the Board of Trustees of AIM Investment"
"6093","Funds (Invesco Investment Funds), a Delaware statutory trust created under the"
"6094","laws of the State of Delaware (the Trust), to provide for"
"6095","the recapitalization of the Invesco Global Markets Strategy Fund, a series of"
"6096","the Trust (the Fund), as described herein."
"6097","1. Definition of Terms."
"6098","   For purposes of this Plan, the following terms used herein shall have the"
"6099","following meanings:"
"6100","   (a) Charter shall mean the Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated"
"6101","September 14, 2005, as amended and supplemented to date."
"6102","   (b) Class H1 Shares shall mean the shares of beneficial interest of the"
"6103","Fund that have been established and designated by the Trust's Board of Trustees"
"6104","as Class H1 Shares."
"6105","   (c) Class Y Shares shall mean the shares of beneficial interest of the"
"6106","Fund that have been established and designated by the Trust's Board of Trustees"
"6107","as Class Y Shares."
"6108","   (d) Fund shall mean the shares of beneficial interest of the Trust which"
"6109","have been designated in its Charter as the Invesco Global Markets Strategy Fund."
"6110","   (e) Recapitalization shall mean the proposed recapitalization of the Fund"
"6111","set forth in this Plan."
"6112","   (f) Trust shall mean AIM Investment Funds (Invesco Investment Funds), a"
"6113","Delaware statutory trust."
"6114","2. Purpose."
"6115","   The purpose of the Recapitalization, as described herein, is to eliminate"
"6116","the current issued and outstanding Class H1 Shares of the Fund and cease to"
"6117","offer Class H1 Shares by converting all existing Class H1 Shares into Class Y"
"6118","Shares of the Fund."
"6119","3. Present Capitalization."
"6120","   The Fund has an unlimited number of shares classified and allocated to Class"
"6121","H1 Shares and Class Y Shares, although only Class H1 Shares are presently"
"6122","issued and outstanding. The rights and privileges of Class H1 Shares and Class"
"6123","Y Shares are equal in all respects except that (i) the eligibility criteria to"
"6124","purchase Class H1 Shares is different from the eligibility criteria to purchase"
"6125","Class Y shares; and (ii) shareholders of each of Class H1 Shares and Class Y"
"6126","Shares would have separate voting rights on any matter submitted to"
"6127","shareholders in which the interests of that class differ from the interests of"
"6128","any other class."

"6131","4. Proposed Capitalization."
"6132","   Pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Trust's Board of Trustees all issued"
"6133","shares previously designated as Class H1 Shares will be converted into Class Y"
"6134","Shares of the Fund."
"6135","5. Conditions to Implementation."
"6136","   The implementation of the Recapitalization is subject to this Plan having"
"6137","been approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, including a majority of"
"6138","the Trustees who are not interested as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the"
"6139","Investment Company Act of 1940 in accordance with the Charter and the laws of"
"6140","the State of Delaware."
"6141","   The Trustees of the Trust, in their discretion at any time prior to the"
"6142","Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), may determine to abandon the"
"6143","Recapitalization if, in the opinion of the Trustees, it is not in the best"
"6144","interests of the Fund and its shareholders to implement the Recapitalization."
"6145","6. Effective Time."
"6146","   The Recapitalization will be effective, subject to the satisfaction of the"
"6147","conditions set forth in Section 5 hereof, at 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on"
"6148","August 28, 2013 (the Effective Time)."
"6149","7. Conversion of Shares."
"6150","   At the Effective Time, the manner and basis of converting the shares of the"
"6151","Class H1 Shares of the Fund into Class Y Shares of the Fund, shall be as"
"6152","follows: by virtue of the Board's adoption of this Plan and without any action"
"6153","on the part of the Fund or the holder of such shares, the Class H1 Shares"
"6154","issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the"
"6155","Outstanding Class H1 Shares) shall be converted into, and shall become issued"
"6156","and outstanding Class Y Shares on the basis that each holder of Outstanding"
"6157","Class H1 Shares shall become the holder of record at the Effective Time of the"
"6158","number of Class Y Shares that shall equal in value the net asset value"
"6159","attributable to such holder's Outstanding Class H1 Shares immediately prior to"
"6160","the Effective Time. The net asset value of Class Y Shares received in exchange"
"6161","for Outstanding Class H1 Shares shall be the same as the net asset value of the"
"6162","shares so exchanged."
"6163","8. Additional Action for Implementation."
"6164","   The proper officers and counsel to the Trust, in addition to taking the"
"6165","action set forth in this Plan, shall:"
"6166","   (a) carry out the execution of the appropriate accounting entries to reflect"
