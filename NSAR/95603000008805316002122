"776","Item 77D Deutsche Alternative Asset Allocation"
"777","Fund (a series of Deutsche Market Trust)"
"778","The fund's Board of Trustees (the Board) on"
"779","November 11, 2015 approved a recommendation"
"780","by Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc."
"781","(DIMA), the fund's investment advisor, to"
"782","restructure Deutsche Alternative Asset Allocation"
"783","Fund from a fund-of-funds (i.e., a fund investing"
"784","primarily in other Deutsche funds) into a direct"
"785","investment fund (i.e., a fund investing directly in"
"786","securities and other investments). As a fund investing"
"787","directly in securities and other investments, the fund"
"788","no longer bears the underlying fund expenses that it"
"789","incurs as a fund-of-funds. As part of the restructuring,"
"790","the fund also adjusted its investment focus from"
"791","alternative (or non-traditional) asset categories and"
"792","investment strategies (including investments in real
assets) to a focus on a broader range of real assets,"
"793","using both traditional and alternative investment"
"794","strategies."
"795","On April 26, 2016, Deutsche Alternative Asset"
"796","Allocation Fund was renamed Deutsche Real Assets"
"797","Fund, and its investment objective was changed to read"
"798","as follows:"
"799","The fund seeks total return in excess of inflation"
"800","through capital growth and current income."
"801","On April 26, 2016, the fund's principal investment"
"802","strategy was modified to read as follows:"
"803","Main investments. The fund will invest at"
"804","least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of"
"805","any borrowings for investment purposes"
"806","(calculated at the time of any investment), in a"
"807","combination of investments that the Advisor"
"808","believes offer expo- sure to real assets."
"809","Currently, the Advisor intends to seek exposure"
"810","to the following real assets categories (either"
"811","directly or through investments in companies"
"812","that own or derive a significant portion of"
"813","their value from such real assets or the"
"814","production thereof): real estate, commodities,"
"815","natural resources, infrastructure, gold and"
"816","other precious metals, master limited"
"817","partnerships (MLPs), Treasury Inflation-"
"818","Protected Securities (TIPS) and other fixed"
"819","income securities. However, these exposures"
"820","may change from time to time and exposures to"
"821","new real assets categories may be added or"
"822","exposures to existing real assets categories may"
"823","be deleted."

"831","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"832","Accounting Firm"
"833","To the Shareholders and the Board of Trustees of"
"834","Deutsche Market Trust:"
"835","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"836","statements of Deutsche Alternative Asset Allocation"
"837","Fund, a series of Deutsche Market Trust (the"
"838","Company), as of and for the year ended March 31,"
"839","2016, in accordance with the standards of the"
"840","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"841","(United States), we considered the Company's"
"842","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"843","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"844","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"845","of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"846","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"847","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"848","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's"
"849","internal control over financial reporting."
"850","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"851","The management of the Company is responsible"
"852","for establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"853","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"854","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"855","management are required to assess the expected"
"856","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"857","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"858","designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"859","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"860","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"861","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"862","accounting principles. A company's internal control"
"863","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"864","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"865","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"866","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"867","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"868","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"869","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"870","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"871","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"872","expenditures of the company are being made only"
"873","in accordance with authorizations of management"
"874","and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"875","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"876","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"877","disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"878","material effect on the financial statements."
"879","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"880","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"881","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"882","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"883","risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"884","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"885","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"886","deteriorate."
"887","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"888","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"889","control does not allow management or employees,"
"890","in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"891","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"892","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"893","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"894","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"895","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"896","of the company's annual or interim financial"
"897","statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"898","timely basis."
"899","Our consideration of the Company's internal control"
"900","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"901","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"902","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"903","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"904","standards established by the Public Company"
"905","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"906","However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"907","Company's internal control over financial reporting"
"908","and its operation, including controls over"
"909","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"910","material weakness as defined above as of March"
"911","31, 2016."
"912","This report is intended solely for the information"
"913","and use of management and the Board of Trustees"
"914","of Deutsche Market Trust and the Securities and"
"915","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be"
"916","and should not be used by anyone other than these"
