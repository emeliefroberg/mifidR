"4418","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"4419","Firm"
"4420","The Shareholders and Board of"
"4421","Directors"
"4422","Principal Funds, Inc."
"4423","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"4424","of Blue Chip Fund, Bond Market Index Fund, Capital Securities"
"4425","Fund, Diversified Real Asset Fund, Global Multi-Strategy Fund,"
"4426","Global Opportunities Fund, International Equity Index Fund,"
"4427","International Small Company Fund, Opportunistic Municipal"
"4428","Fund, Preferred Securities Fund, and Small-MidCap Dividend"
"4429","Income Fund, (11 of the portfolios constituting the Principal"
"4430","Funds, Inc. (collectively the Funds)) as of and for the period"
"4431","ended August 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the"
"4432","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"4433","considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"4434","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"4435","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"4436","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"4437","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"4438","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"4439","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"4440","opinion."
"4441","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"4442","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"4443","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"4444","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"4445","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"4446","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"4447","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"4448","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"4449","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"4450","company's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"4451","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"4452","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"4453","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"4454","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"4455","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"4456","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that"
"4457","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"4458","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"4459","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"4460","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"4461","disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect"
"4462","on the financial statements."
"4463","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"4464","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"4465","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"4466","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"4467","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"4468","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4469","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"4470","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"4471","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"4472","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"4473","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"4474","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"4475","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"4476","the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"4477","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"4478","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"4479","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"4480","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"4481","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"4482","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"4483","(United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"4484","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"4485","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"4486","be a material weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2014."
"4487","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"4488","management and the Board of Directors of the Funds and the"
"4489","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"4490","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"9108","declared by the Board of Directors, the excess of"
"9109","the assets belonging to that series or class over"

"9111","holders of shares of any series or class shall not"
"9112","be entitled thereby to any distribution upon"
"9113","liquidation of any other series or class.  The assets"
"9114","so distributable to the stockholders of any"

"9508","AGREEMENT executed as of the 7th day of April, 2014, by and between"
"9509","PRINCIPAL MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, an Iowa corporation"
"9510","(hereinafter called the Manager), and GRAHAM CAPITAL"
"9511","MANAGEMENT L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (hereinafter called"
"9512","the Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each
series of the Principal  Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end
management investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it
with portfolio selection in connection with the investment advisory
services for each series of the Fund identified in Appendix A (hereinafter
called the Series), which the Manager has agreed to provide to the
Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to furnish such services on the terms
and conditions set forth herein;; and

WHEREAS, the Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies
properly certified or authenticated of each of the following:

 (a)	The Amended and Restated Management Agreement between
the Fund and the Manager (the Management Agreement) with
the Fund;

 (b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

 (c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and
services provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement,
the Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the
services described in Section 2 below for investment and
reinvestment of the securities and other assets of the Series,
subject to the supervision and direction of the Manager and the
Fund's Board of Directors, for the period and on the terms
hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts such appointment
and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter set forth for the
compensation herein provided. The Sub-Advisor shall provide
such services with respect to the portion of the assets of the
Series allocated to it for management from time to time by the
Manager.  The Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be
deemed to be an independent contractor and shall, except as
expressly provided or authorized herein, have no authority to act
for or represent the Fund or the Manager in any way or
otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

 		The Sub-Advisor will:
(i)    Provide investment advisory services, including but not
limited to research, advice and supervision for the
Series.  Assets allocated to the Sub-Advisor but not
required for margin to support its trading shall be
invested by the Fund and shall not be the responsibility
of the Sub-Advisor

(ii)	Furnish to the Board of Directors  for approval (or any
appropriate committee of such Board of Directors), and
revise from time to time as economic conditions require,
a recommended investment program for the Series
consistent with the Series' written investment objective
and policies.

(iii)	Implement the approved investment program on behalf
of the Fund by placing orders for the purchase, sale and
exchange of securities, commodity interests (as
defined in the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended)
and other financial instruments  without prior
consultation with the Manager and without regard to the
length of time the securities and other financial
instruments have been held, the resulting rate of
portfolio turnover or any tax considerations, subject
always to  (i) the provisions of the Fund's Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws and (ii) the requirements of the
1940 Act, to the extent within the Sub-Advisor's control
as each of the same shall be from time to time in effect.

(iv)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as reasonably
requested by the officers, in taking such steps as are
reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the
decisions of its Board of Directors, and any appropriate
committees of such Board, regarding the general
conduct of the investment business of the Series.

(v)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's
investment advisory services provided to the Series, its
compliance with the 1940 Act and the regulations
adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) thereunder and the Series' investment strategies
and restrictions as stated in the Fund's prospectus and
statement of additional information (together, the
Registration Statement), subject to receipt of such
additional information as may be required from the
Manager and provided in accordance with Section 11(d)
of this Agreement.

(vi)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such
times and in such detail as the Board of Directors may
reasonably deem appropriate in order to enable it to
determine that the investment policies, procedures and
approved investment program of the Series are being
observed.

(vii)	Upon request, provide reasonable assistance in the
determination of the fair value of certain securities when
reliable market quotations are not readily available for
purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance
with procedures and methods established by the Board
of Directors.

(viii)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment
and management facilities, including salaries of clerical
and other personnel required for it to execute its duties
faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including
bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment
necessary for the efficient conduct of its duties under this
Agreement.

(ix)	Open accounts with broker-dealers,  futures commission
merchants, banks and other financial institutions
(collectively broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to
effect all transactions for the Series, place all necessary
orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated
broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if
applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law,
purchase or sell orders for the Series may be
aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell
orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event
allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as
the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by
the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor
considers to be the most equitable and consistent with
its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients
of the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates over time.  The
Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure
may limit the size of the position that may be acquired or
sold for the Series and that aggregation of orders may
not result in more favorable pricing or lower brokerage
commissions in all instances. At the Manager's request,
the Sub-Advisor will provide the Manager with the
information required pursuant to Rule 31a-1(b)(9) of the
1940 Act.   The Sub-Advisor will effect transactions with
those broker-dealers which it believes provide favorable
net prices and are capable of providing efficient
executions, taking into consideration, among other
things, order size, difficulty of execution, the operational
capabilities, facilities and financial condition of the
broker-dealer involved, whether that broker-dealer has
risked its own capital in positioning a block of securities
or other assets, and the prior experience of the broker-
dealer in effecting transactions of the relevant types. The
Sub-Advisor's primary objective will be to obtain best
execution with respect to all transactions for the Series.
However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers-dealers
on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or
other services or products to the Sub-Advisor or its
affiliates. To the extent consistent with applicable law,
the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount
of commission for effecting a securities transaction in
excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread
another broker- dealer would have charged for effecting
that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good
faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in
relation to the value of the brokerage and research
products and/or services provided by such broker-
dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage
and research products and/or services, may be viewed
in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates
have with respect to the Series and other accounts over
which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such
services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in
managing the Series. In addition, joint repurchase or
other accounts may not be utilized by the Series except
to the extent permitted under any exemptive order
obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions
of such order are complied with.

(x)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to
the Series as are required of an investment adviser of a
registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act
and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended
(the Investment Advisers Act), and the rules
thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with
such periodic and special reports as the Fund or
Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with
the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the
Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it
maintains for the Series are the property of the Fund,
agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule
31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains
for the Fund and that are required to be maintained by
Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to
surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it
maintains for the Series upon request by the Fund or the
Manager. The Sub-Advisor may retain copies of any
such records.

(xi)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act
and the Sub-Advisor's code of ethics (the Code of"
"9513","Ethics) adopted pursuant to Rule 17j-1 as the same
may be amended from time to time.  The Manager
acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current
Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to
the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics.

(xii)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may
request, furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio
transactions and reports on investments held by the
Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund
may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor will make
available its personnel to meet with the Fund's Board of
Directors at the Fund's principal place of business on
reasonable prior notice to review the investments of the
Series.

(xiii)	Provide such additional information in the possession of
the Sub-Advisor or its affiliates may be required for the
Fund or the Manager to comply with their respective
obligations under applicable laws, including, without
limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment
Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and
any rule or regulation thereunder.  Sub-Advisor will
advise Manager of any changes in Sub-Advisor's Senior
Management (i.e. Chief Investment Officer and/or Chief
Executive Officer) within a reasonable time after any
such change.  Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-
Advisor's Form ADV more than 48 hours prior to the
execution of this Agreement.

(xiv)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies
solicited by, or with respect to, the issuers of securities
held in the Series in accordance with the Sub-Advisor's
proxy voting policy as most recently provided to the
Manager. The Sub-Advisor's obligations in the previous
sentence are contingent upon its timely receipt of such
proxy solicitation materials from the Manager.  The
Manager shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor all
proxy solicitation materials that it receives and shall
assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the proxy
voting process.



    3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-
Advisor will not consult with any other investment advisory firm
that provides investment advisory services to any investment
company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company
regarding transactions for the Fund in securities or other assets.
The Manager agrees to provide a list of such other investment
advisory firms to the Sub-Advisor, such list to be promptly
updated by the Manager upon any changes thereto.

    4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the
Fund, the Manager shall pay the compensation specified in
Appendix A to this Agreement.

    5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its partners, members,
directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable
to the Manager, the Board of Directors, the Fund or its
shareholders for any claim, expense or other  loss suffered by
the Manager or the Fund resulting from any error of judgment
made in the good faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's duties
under this Agreement or as a result of the failure by the Manager
or any of its affiliates to comply with the terms of this Agreement
except for losses resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or
gross negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of
the Sub-Advisor or any of its partners, members, directors,
officers, employees, agents (excluding any broker-dealer
selected by the Sub-Advisor), or affiliates.

      6.   Trade Errors

The Sub-Advisor will notify the Manager of any Trade Error(s),
regardless of materiality, promptly upon the discovery such
Trade Error(s) by the Sub-Advisor. Notwithstanding Section 5,

or its shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the
Fund resulting from Trade Errors. Any gains which occur due to
a Trade Error shall be retained by the Fund. For purposes under
this Section, Trade Errors are defined as errors (regardless of
cause, and including, but not limited to errors caused, at least in
part, by manual error or systems-related issues such as coding,
unauthorized access, or security breach)  due to (i) erroneous
orders by the Sub-Advisor for the Series that result in the

persons affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third
parties to better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations
under this Agreement for the provision of certain personnel and
facilities to the Sub- Advisor, subject to written notification to and
approval of the Manager and, where required by applicable law,
the Board of Directors.

"9584","committees of such Board, regarding the general"
"9585","conduct of the investment business of the Series."
"9586","(v)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's"
"9587","investment advisory services provided to the Series, its"
"9588","compliance with the 1940 Act and the regulations"
"9589","adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"9590","(SEC) thereunder and the Series' investment strategies"
"9591","and restrictions as stated in the Fund's prospectus and"
"9592","statement of additional information (together , the"
"9593","Registration Statement), subject to receipt of such"
"9594","additional information as may be required from the"
"9595","Manager and provided in accordance with Section 11(d)"
"9596","of this Agreement."
"9597","(vi)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such"
"9598","times and in such detail as the Board of Directors may"
"9599","reasonably deem appropriate in order to enable it to"
"9600","determine that the investment policies, procedures and"
"9601","approved investment program of the Series are being"
"9602","observed."
"9603","(vii)	Upon request, provide reasonable assistance in the"
"9604","determination of the fair value of certain securities when"
"9605","reliable market quotations are not readily available for"
"9606","purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance"
"9607","with procedures and methods established by the Board"
"9608","of Directors."
"9609","(viii)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment"
"9610","and management facilities, including salaries of clerical"
"9611","and other personnel required for it to execute its duties"
"9612","faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including"
"9613","bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment"
"9614","necessary for the efficient conduct of its duties under this"
"9615","Agreement."
"9616","(ix)	Open accounts with broker-dealers,  futures commission"
"9617","merchants, banks and other financial institutions"
"9618","(collectively broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to"
"9619","effect all transactions for the Series, place all necessary"
"9620","orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated"
"9621","broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if"
"9622","applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law,"
"9623","purchase or sell orders for the Series may be"
"9624","aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell"
"9625","orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event"
"9626","allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as"
"9627","the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by"
"9628","the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor"
"9629","considers to be the most equitable and consistent with"
"9630","its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients"
"9631","of the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates over time.  The"
"9632","Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure"
"9633","may limit the size of the position that may be acquired or"
"9634","sold for the Series and that aggregation of orders may"
"9635","not result in more favorable pricing or lower brokerage"
"9636","commissions in all instances. At the Manager's request,"
"9637","the Sub-Advisor will provide the Manager with the"
"9638","information required pursuant to Rule 31a-1(b)(9) of the"
"9639","1940 Act.   The Sub-Advisor will effect transactions with"
"9640","those broker-dealers which it believes provide favorable"
"9641","net prices and are capable of providing efficient"
"9642","executions, taking into consideration, among other"
"9643","things, order size, difficulty of execution, the operational"
"9644","capabilities, facilities and financial condition of the"
"9645","broker-dealer involved, whether that broker-dealer has"
"9646","risked its own capital in positioning a block of securities"
"9647","or other assets, and the prior experience of the broker-"
"9648","dealer in effecting transactions of the relevant types. The"
"9649","Sub-Advisor's primary objective will be to obtain best"
"9650","execution with respect to all transactions for the Series."
"9651","However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers-dealers"
"9652","on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or"
"9653","other services or products to the Sub-Advisor or its"
"9654","affiliates. To the extent consistent with applicable law,"
"9655","the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount"
"9656","of commission for effecting a securities transaction in"
"9657","excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread"
"9658","another broker- dealer would have charged for effecting"
"9659","that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good"
"9660","faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in"
"9661","relation to the value of the brokerage and research"
"9662","products and/or services provided by such broker-"
"9663","dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage"
"9664","and research products and/or services, may be viewed"
"9665","in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"9666","responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates"
"9667","have with respect to the Series and other accounts over"
"9668","which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such"
"9669","services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in"
"9670","managing the Series. In addition, joint repurchase or"
"9671","other accounts may not be utilized by the Series except"
"9672","to the extent permitted under any exemptive order"
"9673","obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions"
"9674","of such order are complied with."
"9675","(x)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to"
"9676","the Series as are required of an investment adviser of a"
"9677","registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act"
"9678","and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended"
"9679","(the Investment Advisers Act), and the rules"
"9680","thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with"
"9681","such periodic and special reports as the Fund or"
"9682","Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with"
"9683","the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the"
"9684","Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it"
"9685","maintains for the Series are the property of the Fund,"
"9686","agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule"
"9687","31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains"
"9688","for the Fund and that are required to be maintained by"
"9689","Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to"
"9690","surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it"
"9691","maintains for the Series upon request by the Fund or the"
"9692","Manager. The Sub-Advisor may retain copies of any"
"9693","such records."
"9694","(xi)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act"
"9695","and the Sub-Advisor's code of ethics (the Code of
Ethics) adopted pursuant to Rule 17j-1 as the same"
"9696","may be amended from time to time.  The Manager"
"9697","acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current"
"9698","Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to"
"9699","the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the"
"9700","Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics."
"9701","(xii)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may"
"9702","request, furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio"
"9703","transactions and reports on investments held by the"
"9704","Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund"
"9705","may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor will make"
"9706","available its personnel to meet with the Fund's Board of"
"9707","Directors at the Fund's principal place of business on"
"9708","reasonable prior notice to review the investments of the"
"9709","Series."
"9710","(xiii)	Provide such additional information in the possession of"
"9711","the Sub-Advisor or its affiliates may be required for the"
"9712","Fund or the Manager to comply with their respective"
"9713","obligations under applicable laws, including, without"
"9714","limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as"

"9729","Manager. The Sub-Advisor's obligations in the previous"
"9730","sentence are contingent upon its timely receipt of such"
"9731","proxy solicitation materials from the Manager.  The"
"9732","Manager shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor all"
"9733","proxy solicitation materials that it receives and shall"
"9734","assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the proxy"
"9735","voting process."

"10048","Series are being observed."
"10049","(g)	Upon request, provide assistance and recommendations for the"

"10062","transactions for each Series, place all necessary orders with"
"10063","broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-dealers), and"

"10067","other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of"
"10068","securities so sold or purchased, as well as the expenses incurred"

"10081","Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis that they"
"10082","provide brokerage, research or other services or products to the"
"10083","Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the"
"10084","Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission"
"10085","for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of"
"10086","commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have"

"10089","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research"
"10090","products and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This"
"10091","determination, with respect to brokerage and research products"
"10092","and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either that particular"
"10093","transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor"
"10094","and its affiliates have with respect to each Series as well as to"
"10095","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all"

"10630","for the determination of the fair value of certain securities"
"10631","when reliable market quotations are not readily available"
"10632","for purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance"
"10633","with procedures and methods established by the Fund's"
"10634","Board of Directors."
"10635","(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment"
"10636","and management facilities, including salaries of clerical"
"10637","and other personnel required for it to execute its duties"
"10638","faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including"
"10639","bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment necessary"
"10640","for the efficient conduct of the investment advisory affairs"
"10641","of each Series."
"10642","(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures"
"10643","commission merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-"
"10644","dealers to effect all transactions for each Series, place all"
"10645","necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including"
"10646","affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if"
"10647","applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law,"
"10648","purchase or sell orders for each Series may be"
"10649","aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell orders"
"10650","of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event"
"10651","allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as"
"10652","the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by"
"10653","the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers"
"10654","to be the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary"
"10655","obligations to the Fund and to other clients.  The Sub-"
"10656","Advisor will report on such allocations at the request of the"
"10657","Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors"
"10658","providing such information as the number of aggregated"
"10659","trades to which each Series was a party, the broker-"
"10660","dealers to whom such trades were directed and the basis"
"10661","for the allocation for the aggregated trades.  The Sub-"
"10662","Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of"
"10663","transactions for each Series at prices which are"
"10664","advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that"
"10665","are reasonable in relation to the benefits received."
"10666","However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers"
"10667","on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or"
"10668","other services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the"
"10669","extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor"
"10670","may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for"
"10671","effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount"
"10672","of commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer"
"10673","would have charged for effecting that transaction if the"
"10674","Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of"
"10675","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"10676","brokerage and research products and/or services provided"
"10677","by such broker or dealer. This determination, with respect"
"10678","to brokerage and research products and/or services, may"
"10679","be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"10680","the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its"
"10681","affiliates have with respect to each Series as well as to"
"10682","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion."
"10683","Not all such services or products need be used by the"
"10684","Sub-Advisor in managing the Series.  In addition, joint"
"10685","repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by the"
"10686","Series except to the extent permitted under any exemptive"
"10687","order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all"
"10688","conditions of such order are complied with."
"10689","(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to"
"10690","each Series as are required of an investment advisor of a"
"10691","registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act"
"10692","and Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment
Advisers Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the"
"10693","Fund and the Manager with such periodic and special"
"10694","reports as the Fund or Manager may reasonably request."
"10695","In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under"
"10696","the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all"
"10697","records that it maintains for each Series are the property"
"10698","of the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described"
"10699","by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it"
"10700","maintains for the Series and that are required to be"
"10701","maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further"
"10702","agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any records that"
"10703","it maintains for a Series upon request by the Fund or the"
"10704","Manager.  The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the"
"10705","maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is directly"
"10706","related to the services the Sub-Advisor provides to a"
"10707","Series."
"10708","(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act"
"10709","and the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to"
"10710","that Rule as the same may be amended from time to time."
"10711"," The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-"
"10712","Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall"
"10713","promptly forward to the Manager a copy of any material"
"10714","amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics along"
"10715","with certification that the Sub-Advisor has implemented"
"10716","procedures for administering the Sub-Advisor's Code of"
"10717","Ethics."
"10718","(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may"
"10719","request, furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio"
