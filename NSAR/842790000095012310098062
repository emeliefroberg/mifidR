"2020","     1.1. It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Reorganization"
"2021","described herein shall be conducted separately of the others, and a party that"
"2022","is not a party to a Reorganization shall incur no obligations, duties or"
"2023","liabilities with respect to such Reorganization by reason of being a party to"
"2024","this Agreement. If any one or more Reorganizations should fail to be"
"2025","consummated, such failure shall not affect the other Reorganizations in any way."
"2026","<PAGE>"
"2027","     1.2. Provided that all conditions precedent to a Reorganization set forth"
"2028","herein have been satisfied as of the Closing Date (defined in Section 3.1), and"
"2029","based on the representations and warranties each party provides to the others,"
"2030","each Target Entity and its corresponding Acquiring Entity agree to take the"
"2031","following steps with respect to their Reorganization(s), the parties to which"
"2032","and classes of shares to be issued in connection with which are set forth in"
"2033","Exhibit A:"
"2034","          (a) The Target Fund shall transfer all of its Assets, as defined and"
"2035","     set forth in Section 1.2(b), to the Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund"
"2036","     in exchange therefor shall assume the Liabilities, as defined and set forth"
"2037","     in Section 1.2(c), and deliver to the Target Fund the number of full and"
"2038","     fractional Acquiring Fund shares determined in the manner set forth in"
"2039","     Section 2."
"2040","          (b) The assets of the Target Fund to be transferred to the Acquiring"
"2041","     Fund shall consist of all assets and property, including, without"
"2042","     limitation, all cash, securities, commodities and futures interests, claims"
"2043","     (whether absolute or contingent, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued and"
"2044","     including, without limitation, any interest in pending or future legal"
"2045","     claims in connection with past or present portfolio holdings, whether in"
"2046","     the form of class action claims, opt-out or other direct litigation claims,"
"2047","     or regulator or government-established investor recovery fund claims, and"
"2048","     any and all resulting recoveries) and dividends or interest receivable that"

"2050","     an asset on the books of the Target Fund on the Closing Date, except for"
"2051","     cash, bank deposits or cash equivalent securities in an amount necessary to"
"2052","     pay the estimated costs of extinguishing any Excluded Liabilities (as"
"2053","     defined in Section 1.2(c)) and cash in an amount necessary to pay any"
"2054","     distributions pursuant to Section 7.1(g) (collectively, Assets)."
"2055","          (c) The Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the liabilities of the"
"2056","     Target Fund, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at"
"2057","     the Closing Date, except for the Target Fund's Excluded Liabilities (as"
"2058","     defined below), if any, pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, with"
"2059","     respect to each Target Fund separately, Liabilities). Each Target Fund"
"2060","     will use its best efforts to discharge all known Liabilities prior to or at"
"2061","     the Valuation Date (as defined in Section 2.1(a)) to the extent possible"
"2062","     and consistent with its own investment objectives and policies and normal"
"2063","     business operations. If prior to the Closing Date the Acquiring Entity"
"2064","     identifies a liability that the Acquiring Entity and the Target Entity"
"2065","     mutually agree should not be assumed by the Acquiring Fund, such liability"
