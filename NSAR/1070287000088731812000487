       Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Trustees and Shareholders
Prudential Investment Portfolios 9:

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements
of Prudential Large-Cap Core Equity Fund, a series of Prudential
Investment Portfolios 9 (hereafter referred to as the Fund),
as of and for the year ended October 31, 2012, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,
as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose
of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply
with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion.

Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this
responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to
assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when
the design or operation of a control does not allow management or
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,
to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material
weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis.

Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting
was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would
not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might
be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no
deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting
and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities,
that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of
October 31, 2012.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of management
and the Board of Trustees of the Fund and the Securities and Exchange
Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone
other than these specified parties.

       Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Trustees and Shareholders
Prudential Investment Portfolios 9:

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of
Prudential Absolute Return Bond Fund, a series of Prudential
Investment Portfolios 9 (hereafter referred to as the Fund),
as of and for the year ended October 31, 2012, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,
as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of
expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply
with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such o
pinion.

Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling
this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are
required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists
when the design or operation of a control does not allow management
or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned
functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's
annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph
and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal
control that might be material weaknesses under standards established
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting and its operation, including controls over
safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness
as defined above as of October 31, 2012.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of management
and the Board of Trustees of the Fund and the Securities and Exchange
Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone
other than these specified parties.
