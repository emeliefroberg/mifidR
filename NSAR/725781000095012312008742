"582","             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"583","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Sector Funds (Invesco Sector"
"584","Funds):"
"585","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Invesco"
"586","Technology Sector Fund; (one of the Funds constituting AIM Sector Funds (Invesco"
"587","Sector Funds), hereafter referred to as the Fund), as of and for the year"
"588","ended March 31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"589","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"590","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"591","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"592","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"593","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"594","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"595","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"596","internal control over financial reporting."
"597","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective"
"598","internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"599","estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"600","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over financial"
"601","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"602","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"603","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"604","principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"605","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"606","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"607","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"608","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"609","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"610","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"611","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"612","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"613","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"614","effect on the financial statements."
"615","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"616","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"617","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"618","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"619","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"620","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"621","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"622","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"623","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"624","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"625","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"626","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"627","on a timely basis."
"628","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"629","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"630","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"631","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"632","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"633","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"634","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"635","be material weaknesses as defined above as of March 31, 2012."
"636","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"637","Board of Trustees of AIM Sector Funds (Invesco Sector Funds) and the Securities"
"638","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"639","anyone other than these specified parties."

"691","      On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor -"

"693","Notice of Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (collectively,"
"694","Invesco) (Order No. 05-1318). The WVASC made findings of fact that Invesco"
"695","allegedly entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the"
"696","Invesco Funds and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for"
"697","such Funds, and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco violated the West"
"698","Virginia securities laws. The WVASC ordered Invesco to cease any further"
"699","violations and sought to impose monetary sanctions, including restitution to"
"700","affected investors, disgorgement of fees, reimbursement of investigatory,"
"701","administrative and legal costs and an administrative assessment to be"
"702","determined by the Commissioner. On October 27, 2011, a hearing examiner was"

"950","expenses are required to be disclosed and included in the total annual fund"
"951","operating expenses in the prospectus fee table. As a result, the net total"

"961","limitations should be amended, continued or terminated. The expense limitations"
"962","will expire upon the Expiration Date unless the Trusts and Invesco have agreed"
"963","to continue them. The Exhibits will be amended to reflect any such agreement."
"964","      For the Voluntary Limits (listed in Exhibits A -- D), the Trusts and"
"965","Invesco agree that these are not contractual in nature and that Invesco may"

"967","sole discretion after consultation with the Funds' Boards of Trustees. Any delay"
"968","or failure by Invesco to update this Memorandum of Agreement with regards to the"
