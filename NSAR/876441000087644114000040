"943","<TEXT>"
"944","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"945","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"946","Franklin Templeton Global Allocation Fund"
"947","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"948","Franklin Templeton Global Allocation Fund (the Fund) as of and for"
"949","the year ended May 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the"
"950","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"951","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"952","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"953","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"954","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"955","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"956","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"957","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"958","Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"959","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"960","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"961","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"962","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"963","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"964","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"965","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"966","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"967","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"968","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"969","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"970","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"971","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"972","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"973","with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"974","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"975","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"976","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"977","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that"
"978","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"979","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"980","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"981","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"982","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"983","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"984","procedures may deteriorate."
"985","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"986","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"987","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"988","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"989","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"990","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"991","possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim"
"992","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"993","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"994","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"995","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over"
"996","financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"997","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"998","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal"
"999","control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"1000","over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses"
"1001","as defined above as of May 31, 2014."
"1002","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"1003","and the Board of Trustees of Franklin Templeton Global Allocation Fund"
"1004","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"1005","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1021","October 30, 2013 supplement to the Registrant's prospectus:"
"1022","From 099 P-1 04/14"
"1023","SUPPLEMENT DATED APRIL 1, 2014"
"1024","TO THE PROSPECTUS DATED OCTOBER 1, 2013"
"1025","OF"
"1026","FRANKLIN TEMPLETON GLOBAL ALLOCATION FUND"
"1027","(Franklin Templeton International Trust)"
"1028","The Prospectus is amended as follows:"
"1029","I.  The third paragraph in the Fund Summary - Principal Investment
Strategies section beginning on page 4 is replaced with the following:"
"1030","The Fund is structured as a multi-manager fund, with the investment"
"1031","manager responsible for monitoring the Fund's overall investment"
"1032","performance, managing the Fund's allocation to commodities, managing"
"1033","the Fund's tactical asset allocation, and re-balancing the Fund's"
"1034","portfolio to maintain the baseline allocation to various asset classes"
"1035","and investment strategies. The baseline allocation also may change"
"1036","from time to time, at the discretion of the investment manager."
"1037","IV.  The twelfth paragraph in the Fund Details - Principal Investment
Policies and Practices section beginning on page 15 is replaced with"
"1038","the following:"
"1039","Currently, the Fund's investment manager utilizes ETNs to obtain"
"1040","exposure to commodities. The ETNs used by the investment manager are"
"1041","senior, unsecured unsubordinated debt securities that trade on U.S."
"1042","and foreign stock exchanges at market price. In addition, investors"
"1043","can receive a cash payment at the ETNs' scheduled maturity or through"
"1044","early redemption. The ETNs are backed by the credit of the issuer and"
"1045","their return is linked to the performance of an index intended to"
"1046","reflect the returns that are potentially available through an investment"
"1047","in futures contracts on the physical commodities comprising the index,"
"1048","plus a specified rate of interest. No periodic interest payments are"
"1049","made on the ETNs and there is no principal protection. The ETNs are"
"1050","designed to provide investors, such as the Fund, with a cost-effective"
"1051","investment in broad-based commodities, as measured by the index. The"
"1052","Fund may from time to time hold the ETNs and other commodity-linked"
"1053","instruments, such as commodity-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in"
"1054","a Cayman Islands-based company that is wholly owned by the Fund (the"
"1055","Subsidiary). Investing through the Subsidiary is principally intended"
"1056","to allow the Fund to gain exposure to such commodity-linked instruments"
"1057","within the federal income tax requirements that apply to the Fund."
"1058","V.  The first paragraph under Fund Details - Principal Risks -
Regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act section on page 31 is"
"1059","replaced with the following:"
"1060","Regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act"
"1061","The investment manager is registered as a commodity pool operator"
"1062","(CPO) under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and the rules of the CFTC"
"1063","and is subject to CFTC regulation with respect to the Fund. The CFTC"
"1064","has adopted rules regarding the disclosure, reporting and recordkeeping"
"1065","requirements that will apply with respect to the Fund as a result of"
"1066","the investment manager's registration as a CPO. Generally, these rules"
"1067","allow for substituted compliance with CFTC disclosure and shareholder"
"1068","reporting requirements, based on the investment manager's compliance"
"1069","with comparable SEC requirements. This means that for most of the CFTC's"
"1070","disclosure and shareholder reporting applicable to the investment manager"
"1071","as the Fund's CPO, the investment manager's compliance with SEC"
"1072","disclosure and shareholder reporting will be deemed to fulfill the"
"1073","investment manager's CFTC compliance obligations. However, as a result"
"1074","of CFTC regulation with respect to the Fund, the Fund may incur"
"1075","additional compliance and other expenses. The investment manager is also"
"1076","registered as a commodity trading adviser (CTA), but relies on an"
"1077","exemption with respect to the Fund from CTA regulations available for a"
"1078","CTA that also serves as the Fund's CPO. The CFTC has neither reviewed"
"1079","nor approved the Fund, its investment strategies or this prospectus."
"1080","Please keep this supplement with your prospectus for future reference."
