"830","SETTLED REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO MARKET"
"831","TIMING"
"832","     On October 8, 2004, Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco), successor by merger"
"833","to Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. and INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), both former"
"834","investment advisers, along with Invesco Aim Distributors, n/k/a Invesco"
"835","Distributors, Inc. (Invesco Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"
"836","regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York"
"837","Attorney General and the Colorado Attorney General, to resolve civil enforcement"
"838","actions and/or investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"839","the AIM Funds (n/k/a the Invesco Funds), including those formerly advised by"
"840","IFG. As part of the settlements, a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of which"
"841","is civil penalties) was created to compensate shareholders harmed by market"
"842","timing and related activity in funds formerly advised by IFG. Additionally,"
"843","Invesco and Invesco Distributors created a $50 million fair fund ($30 million of"
"844","which is civil penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and"
"845","related activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done pursuant to the"
"846","terms of the settlement. The methodology of the fair funds distributions was"
"847","determined by Invesco's independent distribution consultant (IDC Plan), in"
"848","consultation with Invesco and the independent trustees of the Invesco Funds, and"
"849","approved by the SEC on May 23, 2008."
"850","     The IDC Plan provides for distribution to all eligible investors for the"
"851","periods spanning January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2003 (for the IFG Fair Fund)"
"852","and January 1, 2001 through September 30, 2003 (for the AIM Fair Fund), their"
"853","proportionate share of the applicable Fair Fund to compensate such investors for"
"854","injury they may have suffered as a result of market timing in the affected"
"855","funds. The IDC Plan includes a provision for any residual amounts in the Fair"
"856","Funds to be distributed in the future to the affected funds. Further details"
"857","regarding the IDC Plan and distributions thereunder are available on Invesco's"
"858","Web site, available at http://www.invesco.com/us."
"859","     On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor -"
"860","Securities Commission (WVASC) issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and"
"861","Notice of Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (collectively,"
"862","Invesco) (Order No. 05-1318). The WVASC made findings of fact that Invesco"
"863","allegedly entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the"
"864","Invesco Funds and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for"
"865","such Funds, and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco violated the West"
"866","Virginia securities laws. The WVASC ordered Invesco to cease any further"
"867","violations and sought to impose monetary sanctions, including restitution to"
"868","affected investors, disgorgement of fees, reimbursement of investigatory,"
"869","administrative and legal costs and an administrative assessment to be"
"870","determined by the Commissioner. Invesco is not aware of any further efforts by"
"871","WVASC to pursue the prosecution of this matter. Invesco settled all other"
"872","regulatory investigations related to market timing, resulting in: 1) affected"
"873","shareholders receiving restitution; 2) Invesco paying disgorgement and civil"
"874","penalties; and 3) Invesco taking remedial actions to prevent market timing."
"875","Accordingly, Invesco considers this matter resolved."

"888","      AIM INVESTMENT SECURITIES FUNDS (INVESCO INVESTMENT SECURITIES FUNDS)"
"889","On October 14, 2010, AIM Investment Securities Funds (Invesco Investment"
"890","Securities Funds) (the Trust) commenced operations of the Class R shares for"
"891","Invesco Van Kampen Corporate Bond Fund (the Fund). Class R shares are sold at"
"892","net asset value, and are not subject to an initial sales charge. Shares of"
"893","beneficial interest of the Trust are redeemable at their net asset value at the"
"894","option of the Trust in certain circumstances, subject in certain circumstances"
"895","to a contingent deferred sales charge or redemption fee. Each class of shares"
"896","represents an interest in the same portfolio of investments. Differing sales"
"897","charges and expenses will result in differing net asset values and dividends and"
"898","distributions. Each share of a Fund generally has the same voting, dividend,"
"899","liquidation and other rights; however, each class of shares of a Fund is subject"
"900","to different sales loads, conversion features, exchange privileges and"
"901","class-specific expenses. Only shareholders of a specific class may vote on"
"902","matters relating to that class' distribution plan. Shareholders of each Fund are"
"903","entitled to one vote per share (with proportionate voting for fractional"
"904","shares), irrespective of the relative net asset value of the shares of a Fund."
"905","However, on matters affecting an individual Fund or class of shares, a separate"
"906","vote of shareholders of that Fund or class is required. Shareholders of a Fund"
"907","or class are not entitled to vote on any matter which does not affect that Fund"
"908","or class but that requires a separate vote of another Fund or class. When"
"909","issued, shares of each Fund are fully paid and nonassessable, have no preemptive"
"910","or subscription rights and are freely transferable. Class R shares do not have"
"911","conversion rights. Class R shares do not have cumulative voting rights, which"
"912","means that when shareholders elect trustees, holders of more than 50% of the"
"913","shares voting for the election of trustees can elect all of the trustees of the"
"914","Trust, and the holders of fewer than 50% of the shares voting for the election"
"915","of trustees will not be able to elect any trustees. Upon any liquidation of the"
"916","Trust, shareholders of each class are entitled to share pro rata in the net"
"917","assets belonging to the applicable Fund allocable to such class available for"
"918","distribution after satisfaction of outstanding liabilities of the Fund allocable"
"919","to such class."
"920","Under Delaware law, shareholders of a Delaware statutory trust shall be entitled"
"921","to the same limitations of liability extended to shareholders of private"
"922","for-profit corporations. There is a remote possibility, however, that"
"923","shareholders could, under certain circumstances, be held liable for the"
"924","obligations of the Trust to the extent the courts of another state which does"
"925","not recognize such limited liability were to apply the laws of such state to a"
"926","controversy involving such obligations. The Amended and Restated Agreement and"
"927","Declaration of Trust (the Trust Agreement) disclaims shareholder liability for"
"928","acts or obligations of the Trust and requires that notice of such disclaimer be"
"929","given in each agreement, obligation or instrument entered into or executed by"
"930","the Trust or the trustees to all parties, and each party thereto must expressly"
"931","waive all rights of action directly against shareholders of the Trust. The Trust"
"932","Agreement provides for indemnification out of the property of a Fund for all"
"933","losses and expenses of any shareholder of such Fund held liable on account of"
"934","being or having been a shareholder. Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring"
"935","financial loss due to shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which"
"936","a Fund is unable to meet its obligations and the complaining party is not held"
"937","to be bound by the disclaimer."

"3235","      liability of the Target Fund arising by reason of undistributed investment"
"3236","      company taxable income or net capital gain, the Target Fund, before the"
"3237","      Closing Date will declare on or prior to the Valuation Date to the"
"3238","      shareholders of Target Fund a dividend or dividends that, together with"
"3239","      all previous such dividends, shall have the effect of distributing (i) all"
"3240","      of its investment company taxable income (determined without regard to any"
"3241","      deductions for dividends paid) and all of its net capital gains (after"
"3242","      reduction for any capital loss carryover), if any, for the period from the"
"3243","      close of its last fiscal year to the Closing Time on the Closing Date;"
"3244","      (ii) any such investment company taxable income and net capital gains for"
"3245","      its taxable year ended prior to the Closing Date to the extent not"
"3246","      otherwise already distributed; and (iii) at least 90 percent of the"
"3247","      excess, if any, of the Target Fund's interest income excludible from gross"
"3248","      income under Section 103(a) of the Code over its deductions disallowed"
"3249","      under Sections 265 and 171(a)(2) of the Code for its taxable year ended"
"3250","      prior to the Closing Date and at least 90 percent of such net tax-exempt"
"3251","      income for the period from the close of its last fiscal year to the"
"3252","      Closing Time on the Closing Date.;"
"3253","            (k) All issued and outstanding shares of the Target Fund are, and on"
"3254","      the Closing Date will be, duly and validly issued and outstanding, fully"
"3255","      paid and non-assessable by the Target Entity and, in every state where"
"3256","      offered or sold, such offers and sales have been in compliance in all"
"3257","      material respects with applicable registration and/or notice requirements"
"3258","      of the 1933 Act and state and District of Columbia securities laws;"
"3259","            (l) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will"

"3573","Target Fund or the Acquiring Fund, the Acquiring Entity or Target Entity,"
"3574","respectively, shall, at its option, not be required to consummate the"

"3576","      8.1. The Agreement shall have been approved by the requisite vote of the"
"3577","holders of the outstanding shares of the Target Fund in accordance with the"
"3578","provisions of the Target Entity's Governing Documents, Delaware law, and the"

"3594","itself waive any of such conditions;"
"3595","      8.4. A registration statement on Form N-14 under the 1933 Act properly"

"3614","      9.1. Each Acquiring Fund will bear its expenses relating to the"
"3615","Reorganizations, which IAI has estimated to be $30,000 per Reorganization. A"
"3616","Target Fund will bear its costs associated with the Reorganization to the extent"
"3617","that the Target Fund is expected to recoup those costs within 24 months"
"3618","following the Reorganization as a result of reduced total annual fund operating"
"3619","expenses based on estimates prepared by the Adviser and discussed with the"
"3620","Board. IAI has agreed to bear the Reorganization costs of any Target Fund that"
"3621","does not meet the foregoing threshold."
