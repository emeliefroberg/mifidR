"512","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"

"521","management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective"
"522","internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"523","estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"524","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund&#8217;s internal control over financial"
"525","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"526","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"527","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"528","principles. A fund&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"529","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"530","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"531","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"532","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"533","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"534","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"535","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"536","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"537","acquisition, use or disposition of the fund&#8217;s assets that could have a material"
"538","effect on the financial statements.</font></div>"

"541","of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not"
