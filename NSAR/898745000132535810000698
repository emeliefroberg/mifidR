"28760","distribution upon liquidation of any other series or class.  The"
"28761","assets so distributable to the shareholder of any particular"

"29976","any distribution upon liquidation of any other series or class."

"29978","series or class shall be distributed among such shareholders"
"29979","according to their respective rights taking into account the"
"29980","proper allocation of expenses being borne by that series or"
"29981","class.  The liquidation of assets attributable to any particular"
"29982","series or class in which there are shares then outstanding and"
"29983","the termination of the series or the class may be authorized by"
"29984","vote of a majority of the Board of Directors then in office,"
"29985","without action or approval of the shareholders, to the extent"
"29986","consistent with applicable laws and regulation.  In the event"
"29987","that there are any general assets not belonging to any particular"
"29988","series or class of stock and available for distribution, such"
"29989","distribution shall be made to holders of stock of various series"
"29990","or classes in such proportion as the Board of Directors"
"29991","determines to be fair and equitable, and such determination by"
"29992","the Board of Directors shall be conclusive and binding for all"
"29993","purposes."
"29994","	(5)	Redemption.  All"
"29995","shares of stock of the Corporation shall have the redemption"
"29996","rights provided for in Article V, Section 5."
"29997","	(d)	The Corporation's shares of stock are issued and sold, and"

"29999","subject to the condition and understanding that the provisions of"
"30000","the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, as from time to time"
"30001","amended, shall be binding upon them."
"30002","	Section 2.  Quorum Requirements and Voting Rights:  Except as"
"30003","otherwise expressly provided by the Maryland General Corporation Law,"
"30004","the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of one-third of the"

"30015","action may be taken or authorized upon the concurrence of a majority of"
"30016","the aggregate number of votes entitled to be cast thereon subject to"

"30018","rules or orders of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any"
"30019","successor thereto.  All shares of stock of this Corporation shall have"
"30020","the voting rights provided for in Article V, Section 1, paragraph (b)."
"30021","	Section 3.  No Preemptive Rights:  No holder of shares of capital"
"30022","stock of the Corporation shall, as such holder, have any right to"
"30023","purchase or subscribe for any shares of the capital stock of the"
"30024","Corporation which the Corporation may issue or sell (whether consisting"

"30027","by it after the issue thereof, or other shares) other than any right"
"30028","which the Board of Directors of the Corporation, in its discretion, may"
"30029","determine."
"30030","	Section 4.  Determination of Net Asset Value: The net asset value of"
"30031","each share of each series or class of each series of the Corporation"
"30032","shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the value of the net assets"
"30033","of the Corporation, or if applicable of the series or class (being the"

"30464","PLAN OF ACQUISITION"
"30465","Short-Term Bond Fund and"
"30466","Short-Term Income Fund"
"30467","         The Board of Directors of Principal Funds, Inc., a Maryland"
"30468","corporation (the Fund), deems it advisable that Short-Term Income"
"30469","Fund series of the Fund (Short-Term Income) acquire all of the assets"
"30470","of Short-Term Bond Fund series of the Fund (Short-Term Bond) in"
"30471","exchange for the assumption by Short-Term Income of all of the"
"30472","liabilities of Short-Term Bond and shares issued by Short-Term Income"
"30473","which are thereafter to be distributed by Short-Term Bond pro rata to"
"30474","its shareholders in complete liquidation and termination of Short-Term"
"30475","Bond and in exchange for all of Short-Term Bond's outstanding shares."
"30476","         Short-Term Bond will transfer to Short-Term Income, and Short-"
"30477","Term Income will acquire from Short-Term Bond, all of the assets of"
"30478","Short-Term Bond on the Closing Date and will assume from Short-Term"
"30479","Bond all of the liabilities of Short-Term Bond in exchange for the"
"30480","issuance of the number of shares of Short-Term Income determined as"
"30481","provided in the following paragraphs, which shares will be subsequently"
"30482","distributed pro rata to the shareholders of Short-Term Bond in complete"
"30483","liquidation and termination of Short-Term Bond and in exchange for all"
"30484","of Short-Term Bond's outstanding shares.  Short-Term Bond will not"
"30485","issue, sell or transfer any of its shares after the Closing Date, and"
"30486","only redemption requests received by Short-Term Bond in proper form"
"30487","prior to the Closing Date shall be fulfilled by Short-Term Bond."
"30488","Redemption requests received by Short-Term Bond thereafter will be"
"30489","treated as requests for redemption of those shares of Short-Term Income"
"30490","allocable to the shareholder in question."
"30491","         Short-Term Bond will declare, and Short-Term Income may declare,"
"30492","to its shareholders of record on or prior to the Closing Date a"
"30493","dividend or dividends which, together with all previous such dividends,"
"30494","shall have the effect of distributing to its shareholders all of its"
"30495","income (computed without regard to any deduction for dividends paid)"
"30496","and all of its net realized capital gains, if any, as of the Closing"
"30497","Date."
"30498","         On the Closing Date, Short-Term Income will issue to Short-Term"
"30499","Bond a number of full and fractional shares of Short-Term Income, taken"
"30500","at their then net asset value, having an aggregate net asset value"
"30501","equal to the aggregate value of the net assets of Short-Term Bond.  The"
"30502","aggregate value of the net assets of Short-Term Bond and Short-Term"
"30503","Income shall be determined in accordance with the then current"
"30504","Prospectus of the Fund as of close of regularly scheduled trading on"
"30505","the New York Stock Exchange on the Closing Date."
"30506","         The closing of the transactions contemplated in this Plan (the"
"30507","Closing) shall be held at the offices of Principal Management"
"30508","Corporation, 680 8th Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50392 at 3:00 p.m."
"30509","Central Time on July 23, 2010, or on such earlier or later date as fund"
"30510","management may determine.  The date on which the Closing is to be held"
"30511","as provided in this Plan shall be known as the Closing Date."
"30512","         In the event that on the Closing Date (a) the New York Stock"
"30513","Exchange is closed for other than customary weekend and holiday"
"30514","closings; or (b) trading on said Exchange is restricted; or (c) an"
"30515","emergency exists as a result of which it is not reasonably practicable"
"30516","for Short-Term Income or Short-Term Bond to fairly determine the value"
"30517","of its assets, the Closing Date shall be postponed until the first"
"30518","business day after the day on which trading shall have been fully"
"30519","resumed."
"30520","         As soon as practicable after the Closing, Short-Term Bond shall"
"30521","(a) distribute on a pro rata basis to the shareholders of record of"
"30522","Short-Term Bond at the close of business on the Closing Date the shares"
"30523","of Short-Term Income received by Short-Term Bond at the Closing in"
"30524","exchange for all of Short-Term Bond's outstanding shares, and (b) be"
"30525","liquidated in accordance with applicable law and the Fund's Articles of"
"30526","Incorporation."
"30527","         For purposes of the distribution of shares of Short-Term Income"
"30528","to shareholders of Short-Term Bond, Short-Term Income shall credit its"
"30529","books an appropriate number of its shares to the account of each"
"30530","shareholder of Short-Term Bond.  No certificates will be issued for"
"30531","shares of Short-Term Income.  After the Closing Date and until"
"30532","surrendered, each outstanding certificate, if any, which, prior to the"
"30533","Closing Date, represented shares of Short-Term Bond, shall be deemed"
"30534","for all purposes of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws to"
"30535","evidence the appropriate number of shares of Short-Term Income to be"
"30536","credited on the books of Short-Term Income in respect of such shares of"
"30537","Short-Term Bond as provided above."
"30538","         Prior to the Closing Date, Short-Term Bond shall deliver to"
"30539","Short-Term Income a list setting forth the assets to be assigned,"
"30540","delivered and transferred to Short-Term Income, including the"
"30541","securities then owned by Short-Term Bond and the respective federal"
"30542","income tax bases (on an identified cost basis) thereof, and the"
"30543","liabilities to be assumed by Short-Term Income pursuant to this Plan."
"30544","         All of Short-Term Bond's portfolio securities shall be delivered"
"30545","by Short-Term Bond's custodian on the Closing Date to Short-Term Income"
"30546","or its custodian, either endorsed in proper form for transfer in such"
"30547","condition as to constitute good delivery thereof in accordance with the"
"30548","practice of brokers or, if such securities are held in a securities"
"30549","depository within the meaning of Rule 17f-4 under the Investment"
"30550","Company Act of 1940, transferred to a Fund in the name of Short-Term"
"30551","Income or its custodian with said depository.  All cash to be delivered"
"30552","pursuant to this Plan shall be transferred from Short-Term Bond at its"
"30553","custodian to Short-Term Income at its custodian.  If on the Closing"
"30554","Date Short-Term Bond is unable to make good delivery to Short-Term"
"30555","Income's custodian of any of Short-Term Bond's portfolio securities"
"30556","because such securities have not yet been delivered to Short-Term"
"30557","Bond's custodian by its brokers or by the transfer agent for such"
"30558","securities, then the delivery requirement with respect to such"
"30559","securities shall be waived, and Short-Term Bond shall deliver to Short-"
"30560","Term Income's custodian on or by said Closing Date with respect to said"
"30561","undelivered securities executed copies of an agreement of assignment in"
"30562","a form satisfactory to Short-Term Income, and a due bill or due bills"
"30563","in form and substance satisfactory to the custodian, together with such"
"30564","other documents including brokers' confirmations, as may be reasonably"
"30565","required by Short-Term Income."
"30566","         This Plan may be abandoned and terminated, whether before or"

"30730","(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission"
"30731","merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to"
"30732","effect all transactions for the Series, place all"
"30733","necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers"
"30734","(including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate"
"30735","commissions, if applicable. To the extent consistent"
"30736","with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the"
"30737","Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase"
"30738","or sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In"
"30739","such event allocation of securities so sold or"
"30740","purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in the"
"30741","transaction, will be made by the Sub-Advisor in the"
"30742","manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the most"
"30743","equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations"
"30744","to the Fund and to other clients.  The Sub-Advisor will"
"30745","report on such allocations at the request of the"
"30746","Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors"
"30747","providing such information as the number of aggregated"
"30748","trades to which the Series was a party, the broker-"
"30749","dealers to whom such trades were directed and the basis"
"30750","for the allocation for the aggregated trades.  The Sub-"
"30751","Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution"
"30752","of transactions for the Series at prices which are"
"30753","advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that"
"30754","are reasonable in relation to the benefits received."
"30755","However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers"
"30756","on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or"
"30757","other services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the"
"30758","extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor"
"30759","may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for"
"30760","effecting a securities transaction in excess of the"
"30761","amount of commission or dealer spread another broker or"
"30762","dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction"
"30763","if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such"
"30764","amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the"
"30765","value of the brokerage and research products and/or"
"30766","services provided by such broker or dealer. This"
"30767","determination, with respect to brokerage and research"
"30768","products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of"
"30769","either that particular transaction or the overall"
"30770","responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its"
"30771","affiliates have with respect to the Series as well as to"
"30772","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion."
"30773","Not all such services or products need be used by the"
"30774","Sub-Advisor in managing the Series.  In addition, joint"
"30775","repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by the"
"30776","Series except to the extent permitted under any"
"30777","exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided"
"30778","that all conditions of such order are complied with."
"30779","(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to"
"30780","the Series as are required of an investment advisor of a"
"30781","registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act"
"30782","and Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment

"31578","BROWN INVESTMENT ADVISORY INCORPORATED SUB-ADVISED FUNDS"
"31579","AGREEMENT executed as of September 14, 2010, by and between PRINCIPAL"
"31580","MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, an Iowa corporation (hereinafter called the
Manager), and BROWN INVESTMENT ADVISORY INCORPORATED, a Maryland"
"31581","corporation (hereinafter called the Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each Fund
of the Principal  Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the 1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it
with portfolio selection and related research and statistical services
in connection with the investment advisory services for each series
identified in Appendix A ( hereinafter called the Series), which the
Manager has agreed to provide to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires
to furnish such services; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies properly
certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly
provide the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated
of any amendment or supplement thereto:

 	(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) with the
Fund;

 	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

 	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by
the Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and
services provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the
Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services
described in Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of
the securities and other assets of the Series, subject to the
control and direction of the Manager and the Fund's Board of
Directors, for the period and on the terms hereinafter set forth.
The Sub-Advisor accepts such appointment and agrees to furnish
the services hereinafter set forth for the compensation herein
provided. The Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be deemed
to be an independent contractor and shall, except as expressly
provided or authorized, have no authority to act for or represent
the Fund or the Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an
agent of the Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not
limited to research, advice and supervision for the Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval
(or any appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from
time to time as economic conditions require, a recommended
investment program for the Fund consistent with the Series'
investment objective and policies.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders
for the purchase and sale of securities without prior
consultation with the Manager and without regard to the
length of time the securities have been held, the resulting
rate of portfolio turnover or any tax considerations, subject
always to the provisions of the Fund's Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws, the requirements of the 1940 Act,
as each of the same shall be from time to time in effect.

 (d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by
the officers, in taking such steps as are reasonably
necessary or appropriate to carry out the decisions of its
Board of Directors, and any appropriate committees of such
Board, regarding the general conduct of the investment
business of the Series.

 (e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services provided to the Series, its compliance with
the 1940 Act and the regulations adopted by the Securities
and Exchange Commission thereunder and the Series' investment
strategies and restrictions as stated in the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information, subject
to receipt of such additional information as may be required
from the Manager and provided in accordance with Section
11(d) of this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor has no
responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except
insofar as is directly related to the services it provides to
the Series.

 (f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times
and in such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably
deem appropriate in order to enable it to determine that the
investment policies, procedures and approved investment
program of the Series are being observed.

 (g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of
the fair value of certain securities when reliable market
quotations are not readily available for purposes of
calculating net asset value in accordance with procedures and
methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors.

 (h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment
and management facilities, including salaries of investment,
clerical and other personnel required for it to execute its
duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities,
including bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment
necessary for the efficient conduct of its duties under this
Agreement.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission
merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect
all transactions for the Series, place all necessary orders
with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-
dealers), and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the
extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell
orders for the Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous
purchase or sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor.
In such event allocation of securities so sold or purchased,
as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be
made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor
considers to be the most equitable and consistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients.  The
Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure may
limit the size of the position that may be acquired or sold
for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor will report on such
allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund or the
Fund's Board of Directors providing such information as the
number of aggregated trades to which the Series was a party,
the broker-dealers to whom such trades were directed and the
basis for the allocation for the aggregated trades.  The Sub-
Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of
transactions for the Series at prices which are advantageous
to the Series and at commission rates that are reasonable in
relation to the benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor
may select brokers or dealers on the basis that they provide
brokerage, research or other services or products to the Sub-
Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the
Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of
commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess
of the amount of commission or dealer spread another broker
or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction
if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such amount
of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the
brokerage and research products and/or services provided by
such broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to
brokerage and research products and/or services, may be
viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the
overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its
affiliates have with respect to the Series as well as to
accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Not
all such services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor
in managing the Series. In addition, joint repurchase or
other accounts may not be utilized by the Series except to
the extent permitted under any exemptive order obtained by
the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions of such order
are complied with.
(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the
Series as are required of an investment advisor of a
registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and
Investment Advisor's Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisor's"
"31582","Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the
Manager with such periodic and special reports as the Fund or
Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with the
requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-
Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it maintains for
the Series are the property of the Fund, agrees to preserve
for the periods described by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act
any records that it maintains for the Fund and that are
required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act,
and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any
records that it maintains for the Series upon request by the
Fund or the Manager.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as
the same may be amended from time to time.  The Manager
acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current Code
of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to the Manager
a copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of
Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request,
furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio
transactions and reports on investments held by the Series,
all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably
request.  The Sub-Advisor will make available its officers
and employees to meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at
the Fund's principal place of business on due notice to
review the investments of the Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-
advisor and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to
comply with their respective obligations under applicable
laws, including, without limitation, the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the
Investment Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the Securities Act), and any state securities
laws, and any rule or regulation thereunder.  Sub-Advisor
will advise Manager of any changes in Sub-Advisor's general
partners within a reasonable time after any such change.
Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-Advisor's Form ADV more
than 48 hours prior to the execution of this Agreement.

(n)	Perform quarterly and annual tax compliance tests to monitor
the Series' compliance with Subchapter M of the Code and
Section 817(h) of the Code, subject to receipt of such
additional information as may be required from the Manager
and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of this
Agreement.  The Sub-Advisor shall notify the Manager
immediately upon having a reasonable basis for believing that
the Series has ceased to be in compliance or that it might
not be in compliance in the future.  If it is determined that
the Series is not in compliance with the requirements noted
above, the Sub-Advisor, in consultation with the Manager,
will take prompt action to bring the Series back into
compliance (to the extent possible) within the time permitted
under the Code.

(o)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies
solicited by, or with respect to, the issuers of securities
held in the Series.  The Manager shall cause to be forwarded
to Sub-Advisor all proxy solicitation materials that it
receives and shall assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to
conduct the proxy voting process.

     3.	Prohibited Conduct

     In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-
Advisor will not consult with any other investment advisory firm
that provides investment advisory services to any investment
company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company regarding
transactions for the Fund in securities or other assets.

     4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the Fund,
the Manager shall pay the compensation specified in Appendix A to
this Agreement.

5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager,
the Fund or its shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager
or the Fund resulting from any error of judgment made in the good
faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's duties under this Agreement
or as a result of the failure by the Manager or any of its
affiliates to comply with the terms of this Agreement except for
losses resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of the
Sub-Advisor or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents
(excluding any broker-dealer selected by the Sub-Advisor), or
affiliates.

6.	Indemnification

The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sub-Advisor
from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities or
damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees and other related
expenses), (Losses) howsoever arising, from or in connection
with this Agreement or the performance by the Sub-Advisor of its
duties hereunder, so long as the Sub-Advisor shall, after receipt
of notice of any claim or commencement of any action, promptly
notify the Manager in writing of the claim or commencement of
such action.  The Manager shall not be liable for any settlement
of any claim or action effected without its written consent.
Nothing contained herein shall require the Manager to indemnify
the Sub-Advisor for Losses resulting from the Sub-Advisor's
willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the
performance of its duties or from its reckless disregard of its
obligations and duties under this Agreement.

7.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons
affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third
parties to better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement for the provision of certain
personnel and facilities to the Sub- Advisor, subject to written
notification to and approval of the Manager and, where required
by applicable law, the Board of Directors of the Fund.

8.	Regulation

bodies having jurisdiction over the services provided pursuant to
this Agreement any information, reports or other material which
any such body may request or require pursuant to applicable laws
and regulations.

9.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement

"31676","consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the"
"31677","Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell"
"31678","orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event"
"31679","allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as the"
"31680","expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the"
"31681","Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the"

"31683","the Fund and to other clients.  The Manager recognizes that, in"
"31684","some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the position"
"31685","that may be acquired or sold for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor"
"31686","will report on such allocations at the request of the Manager,"
"31687","the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing such"
"31688","information as the number of aggregated trades to which the"

"31692","execution of transactions for the Series at prices which are"
"31693","advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that are"
"31694","reasonable in relation to the benefits received. However, the"
"31695","Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis that they"
"31696","provide brokerage, research or other services or products to the"
"31697","Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the"
"31698","Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission"
"31699","for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount"
"31700","of commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would"
"31701","have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor"
"31702","determines in good faith that such amount of commission is"
"31703","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"31704","research products and/or services provided by such broker or"
"31705","dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and"
"31706","research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of"
"31707","either that particular transaction or the overall"
"31708","responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have"
"31709","with respect to the Series as well as to accounts over which"
"31710","they exercise investment discretion. Not all such services or"
"31711","products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series."

"31713","utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any"
"31714","exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all"
"31715","conditions of such order are complied with. The Sub-advisor has"
"31716","no obligation to seek to obtain any material non-public"
"31717","(inside) information about any issuer or securities, and will"
"31718","not purchase or sell for the Series the securities of any issuer"

"31720","Manager recognizes that the Sub-advisor shall not be the"
"31721","Custodian nor be considered to have custody of the Series'"
"31722","holdings as that term is used in the Investment Advisers Act of"
"31723","1940. The Sub-advisor may issue such instructions to the"
"31724","Custodian as Sub-advisor deems appropriate to settle Series"
"31725","transactions. Notices of transactions executed by Sub-advisor"
"31726","will be sent promptly to the Custodian. The Manager represents"
"31727","that the custodial agreement with the Fund's Custodian requires"
"31728","that the Custodian provide the Fund, at least quarterly, with a"
"31729","statement detailing all monies disbursed from the custodial"

"31738","31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all"
"31739","records that it maintains for the Series are the property of the"
"31740","Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2"

"32057","  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"32058","The Shareholders and Board of Directors"
"32059","Principal Funds, Inc."
"32060","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"32061","of Principal Funds, Inc. as of and for the year ended October 31,"
"32062","2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"32063","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered its"
"32064","internal controls over financial reporting, including controls"
"32065","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"32066","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"32067","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"32068","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"32069","the effectiveness of Principal Funds, Inc.'s internal control"
"32070","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"32071","opinion."
"32072","The management of Principal Funds, Inc. is responsible for"
"32073","establishing and maintaining effective internal control over"
"32074","financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"32075","and judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"32076","benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal"
"32077","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"32078","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"32079","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"32080","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"32081","accounting principles. A company's internal control over"
"32082","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"32083","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"32084","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"32085","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"32086","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"32087","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"32088","accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures"
"32089","of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"32090","authorizations of management and directors of the company and (3)"
"32091","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"32092","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"32093","company's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"32094","financial statements."
"32095","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"32096","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"32097","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"32098","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"32099","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"32100","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"32101","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"32102","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"32103","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"32104","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"32105","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"32106","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"32107","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"32108","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"32109","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"32110","timely basis."
"32111","Our consideration of Principal Funds, Inc.'s internal control"
"32112","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"32113","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"32114","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"32115","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"32116","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"32117","deficiencies in Principal Funds, Inc.'s internal control over"
"32118","financial reporting and its operation, including controls for"
"32119","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material"
"32120","weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2010."
"32121","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"32122","management and the Board of Directors of Principal Funds, Inc."

"32182","We are regularly involved in litigation, both as a defendant and"
"32183","as a plaintiff, but primarily as a defendant. Litigation naming"
"32184","us as a defendant ordinarily arises out of our business"
"32185","operations as a provider of asset management and accumulation"
"32186","products and services, life, health and disability insurance."
"32187","Some of the lawsuits are class actions, or purport to be, and"
"32188","some include claims for unspecified or substantial punitive and"
"32189","treble damages. In addition, regulatory bodies such as state"
"32190","insurance departments, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory"
"32191","Authority, the Department of Labor and other regulatory agencies"
"32192","regularly make inquiries and conduct examinations or"
"32193","investigations concerning our compliance with, among other"
"32194","things, insurance laws, securities laws, ERISA and laws governing"
"32195","the activities of broker-dealers. We receive requests from"
"32196","regulators and other governmental authorities relating to"
"32197","industry issues and may receive additional requests, including"
"32198","subpoenas and interrogatories, in the future."
"32199","On October 28, 2009, Judith Curran filed a derivative action"
"32200","lawsuit on behalf of the Principal Funds, Inc. and Strategic"
"32201","Asset Management Portfolio in the United States District Court"
"32202","for the Southern District of Iowa against Principal Management"
"32203","Corporation, Principal Global Investors, LLC, and Principal Funds"
"32204","Distributor, Inc. (the Curran Defendants). The lawsuit alleges"
"32205","the Curran Defendants breached their fiduciary duty under Section"
"32206","36(b) of the Investment Company Act by charging advisory fees and"
"32207","distribution fees that were excessive. The Curran Defendants"
"32208","filed a motion to dismiss the case on January 29, 2010. That"
"32209","motion was granted in part and overruled in part. Principal"
"32210","Global Investors, LLC was dismissed from the suit. The remaining"
"32211","Curran Defendants are aggressively defending the lawsuit."
"32212","While the outcome of any pending or future litigation or"
"32213","regulatory matter cannot be predicted, management does not"
"32214","believe that any pending litigation or regulatory matter will"
"32215","have a material adverse effect on our business or financial"
"32216","position. The outcome of such matters is always uncertain, and"
"32217","unforeseen results can occur. It is possible that such outcomes"
"32218","could materially affect net income in a particular quarter or"
"32219","annual period."
