"807","Accounting Firm"
"808","To the Shareholders"
"809","and Board of Directors"
"810","of"
"811","Federated International"
"812","Series, Inc.:"
"813","In planning and"
"814","performing our audit of"
"815","the financial statements"
"816","of Federated"
"817","International Bond"
"818","Fund (one of the"
"819","portfolios constituting"
"820","Federated International"
"821","Series, Inc.) (the Fund)"
"822","as of"
"823","and for the year ended"
"824","November 30, 2010, in"
"825","accordance with the"
"826","standards of the Public"
"827","Company Accounting"
"828","Oversight Board (United"
"829","States), we considered the"
"830","Fund's internal"
"831","control over financial"
"832","reporting, including"
"833","controls over safeguarding"
"834","securities, as a basis for"
"835","designing our auditing"
"836","procedures for the purpose"
"837","of expressing our"
"838","opinion on the financial"
"839","statements and to comply"
"840","with the requirements of"
"841","Form N-SAR, but not for"
"842","the purpose of"
"843","expressing an opinion on"
"844","the effectiveness of the"
"845","Fund's internal control"
"846","over financial reporting."
"847","Accordingly, we express"
"848","no such opinion."
"849","The management of the"
"850","Fund is responsible for"
"851","establishing and"
"852","maintaining effective"
"853","internal"
"854","control over financial"
"855","reporting.  In fulfilling"
"856","this responsibility,"
"857","estimates and judgments by"
"858","management are required"
"859","to assess the expected"
"860","benefits and related costs"
"861","of controls. A"
"862","company's internal control"
"863","over financial reporting"
"864","is a process designed to"
"865","provide reasonable"
"866","assurance regarding the"
"867","reliability of financial"
"868","reporting and the"
"869","preparation of financial"
"870","statements for external"
"871","purposes in accordance with"
"872","generally accepted"
"873","accounting principles.  A"
"874","company's internal control"
"875","over financial reporting"
"876","includes those policies"
"877","and procedures that"
"878","(1) pertain to the maintenance"
"879","of records that, in reasonable"
"880","detail, accurately and"
"881","fairly reflect"
"882","the transactions and"
"883","dispositions of the assets"
"884","of the company; (2) provide"
"885","reasonable assurance"
"886","that transactions are"
"887","recorded as necessary to"
"888","permit preparation of"
"889","financial statements in"
"890","accordance with generally"
"891","accepted accounting principles,"
"892","and that receipts and"
"893","expenditures of"
"894","the company are being made"
"895","only in accordance with"
"896","authorizations of management"
"897","and"
"898","directors of the company;"
"899","and (3) provide reasonable"
"900","assurance regarding prevention"
"901","or timely"
"902","detection of unauthorized"
"903","acquisition, use or disposition"
"904","of a company's assets that"
"905","could have a"
"906","material effect on the"
"907","financial statements."
"908","Because of its inherent"
"909","limitations, internal control"
"910","over financial reporting may"
"911","not prevent or"
"912","detect misstatements. Also,"
"913","projections of any evaluation"
"914","of effectiveness to future"
"915","periods are"
"916","subject to the risk that"
"917","controls may become inadequate"
"918","because of changes in conditions,"
"919","or that"
"920","the degree of compliance"
"921","with the policies or"
"922","procedures may deteriorate."
"923","A deficiency in internal"
"924","control over financial"
"925","reporting exists when the"
"926","design or operation of a"
"927","control does not allow"
"928","management or employees,"
"929","in the normal course of"
"930","performing their"
"931","assigned functions, to"
"932","prevent or detect misstatements"
"933","on a timely basis.  A"
"934","material weakness is"
"935","a deficiency, or a combination"
"936","of deficiencies, in internal"
"937","control over financial reporting,"
"938","such"
"939","that there is a reasonable"
"940","possibility that a material"
"941","misstatement of the company's"
"942","annual or"
"943","interim financial statements"
"944","will not be prevented or"
"945","detected on a timely basis."
"946","Our consideration of the"
"947","Fund's internal control over"
"948","financial reporting was"
"949","for the limited"
"950","purpose described in the"
"951","first paragraph and would"
"952","not necessarily disclose"
"953","all deficiencies in"
"954","internal control that might"
"955","be material weaknesses under"
"956","standards established by"
"957","the Public"
"958","Company Accounting Oversight"
"959"," Board (United States)."
"960","However, we noted no"
"961","deficiencies in"
"962","the Fund's internal control"
"963","over financial reporting"
"964","and its operation, including"
"965","controls over"
"966","safeguarding securities,"
"967","that we consider to be a"
"968","material weakness as"
"969","defined above as of"
"970","November 30, 2010."
"971","This report is intended"
"972","solely for the information"
"973","and use of management and"
"974","the Board of"
"975","Directors of the Fund and"
"976","the Securities and Exchange"
"977"," Commission and is not"
"978","intended to be and"
"979","should not be used by"
"980","anyone other than these"
"981","specified parties."
