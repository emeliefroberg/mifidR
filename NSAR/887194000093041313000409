"1486","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"

"1489","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1490","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"

"1497","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund&#146;s internal"
"1498","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1499","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1500","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1501","accepted accounting principles. A fund&#146;s internal control over financial"
"1502","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1503","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1504","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1505","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1506","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1507","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1508","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"

"1510","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"1511","of a fund&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial"

"1513","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"

"1519","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1520","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"

"1523","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1524","Company&#146;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
