"763","of expressing an"
"764","opinion on the"
"765","effectiveness of the"
"766","Fund?s internal"
"767","control over"
"768","financial reporting."
"769","Accordingly, we"
"770","express no such"
"771","opinion."
"772","The management of"
"773","the Fund is"
"774","responsible for"
"775","establishing and"
"776","maintaining"
"777","effective internal"
"778","control over"
"779","financial reporting."
"780","In fulfilling this"
"781","responsibility,"
"782","estimates and"
"783","judgments by"
"784","management are"
"785","required to assess"
"786","the expected"
"787","benefits and related"
"788","costs of controls.  A"
"789","company?s internal"
"790","control over"
"791","financial reporting"
"792","is a process"
"793","designed to provide"
"794","reasonable"
"795","assurance regarding"
"796","the reliability of"
"797","financial reporting"
"798","and the preparation"
"799","of financial"
"800","statements for"
"801","external purposes in"
"802","accordance with"
"803","generally accepted"
"804","accounting"
"805","principles.  A"
"806","company?s internal"
"807","control over"
"808","financial reporting"
"809","includes those"
"810","policies and"
"811","procedures that (1)"
"812","pertain to the"
"813","maintenance of"
"814","records that, in"
"815","reasonable detail,"
"816","accurately and"
"817","fairly reflect the"
"818","transactions and"
"819","dispositions of the"
"820","assets of the"
"821","company; (2)"
"822","provide reasonable"
"823","assurance that"
"824","transactions are"
"825","recorded as"
"826","necessary to permit"
"827","preparation of"
"828","financial statements"
"829","in accordance with"
"830","generally accepted"
"831","accounting"
"832","principles, and that"
"833","receipts and"
"834","expenditures of the"
"835","company are being"
"836","made only in"
"837","accordance with"
"838","authorizations of"
"839","management and"
"840","directors of the"
"841","company; and (3)"
"842","provide reasonable"
"843","assurance regarding"
"844","prevention or"
"845","timely detection of"
"846","unauthorized"
"847","acquisition, use or"
"848","disposition of a"
"849","company?s assets"
"850","that could have a"
"851","material effect on"
"852","the financial"
"853","statements."
"854","Because of its"
"855","inherent limitations,"
"856","internal control"
"857","over financial"
"858","reporting may not"
"859","prevent or detect"
"860","misstatements."
"861","Also, projections of"
"862","any evaluation of"
"863","effectiveness to"
"864","future periods are"
"865","subject to the risk"
"866","that controls may"
"867","become inadequate"
"868","because of changes"
"869","in conditions, or"
"870","that the degree of"
"871","compliance with"
"872","the policies or"
"873","procedures may"
"874","deteriorate."
"875","A deficiency in"
"876","internal control"
"877","over financial"
"878","reporting exists"
"879","when the design or"
"880","operation of a"
"881","control does not"
"882","allow management"
"883","or employees, in"
"884","the normal course"
"885","of performing their"
"886","assigned functions,"
"887","to prevent or detect"
"888","misstatements on a"
"889","timely basis.  A"
"890","material weakness"
"891","is a deficiency, or a"
"892","combination of"
"893","deficiencies, in"
"894","internal control"
"895","over financial"
"896","reporting, such that"
"897","there is a"
"898","reasonable"
"899","possibility that a"
"900","material"
"901","misstatement of the"
"902","company?s annual"
"903","or interim financial"
"904","statements will not"
"905","be prevented or"
"906","detected on a timely"
"907","basis."
"908","Our consideration"
"909","of the Fund?s"
"910","internal control"
"911","over financial"
"912","reporting was for"
"913","the limited purpose"
"914","described in the"
"915","first paragraph and"
"916","would not"
"917","necessarily disclose"
"918","all deficiencies in"
"919","internal control that"
"920","might be material"
"921","weaknesses under"
"922","standards"
"923","established by the"
"924","Public Company"
"925","Accounting"
"926","Oversight Board"
"927","(United States)."
"928","However, we noted"
"929","no deficiencies in"
"930","the Fund?s internal"
"931","control over"
"932","financial reporting"
"933","and its operation,"
"934","including controls"
"935","over safeguarding"
"936","securities that we"
"937","consider to be a"
"938","material weakness"
