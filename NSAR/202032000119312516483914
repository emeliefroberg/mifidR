"5248","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"5249","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Growth Series (Invesco Growth"
"5250","Series):"
"5251","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco"
"5252","Balanced-Risk Retirement 2020 Fund, Invesco Balanced-Risk Retirement 2030 Fund,"
"5253","Invesco Balanced-Risk Retirement 2040 Fund, Invesco Balanced-Risk Retirement"
"5254","2050 Fund, Invesco Balanced-Risk Retirement Now Fund, Invesco Conservative"
"5255","Allocation Fund, Invesco Convertible Securities Fund, Invesco Global Low"
"5256","Volatility Equity Yield Fund, Invesco Growth Allocation Fund, Invesco Income"
"5257","Allocation Fund, Invesco International Allocation Fund, Invesco Mid Cap Core"
"5258","Equity Fund, Invesco Moderate Allocation Fund, Invesco Small Cap Growth Fund,"
"5259","Invesco Alternative Strategies Fund, Invesco Multi-Asset Inflation Fund and"
"5260","Invesco U.S. Mortgage Fund (hereafter referred to as the Funds) as of and for"
"5261","the year ended December 31, 2015 in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"5262","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"5263","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"5264","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"5265","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"5266","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"5267","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"5268","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"5269","internal control over financial reporting."
"5270","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"5271","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"5272","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"5273","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"5274","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"5275","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"5276","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"5277","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"5278","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"5279","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"5280","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"5281","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"5282","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"5283","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"5284","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"5285","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"5286","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"5287","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"5288","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"5289","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"5290","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"5291","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"5292","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5293","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"5294","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"5295","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"5296","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"5297","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"5298","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"5299","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"5300","on a timely basis."
"5301","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"5302","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"5303","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"5304","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"5305","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"5306","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"5307","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"5308","be material weaknesses as defined above as of December 31, 2015."

"5360","   1.  Invesco agrees that until the expiration date, if any, of the commitment"
"5361","       set forth on the attached Exhibit B occurs, as such Exhibit B is amended"
"5362","       from time to time, Invesco will waive advisory fees payable by an"

"5367","       i.   Invesco's Fund Accounting Group will calculate, and apply, the"

"5375","       For purposes of the paragraph above, the following terms shall have the"

"5387","       investment securities, dividend payments, or new investor capital."
"5388","   2.  Neither a Trust nor Invesco may remove or amend the Waiver to a Trust's"
"5389","       detriment prior to the Expiration Date without requesting and receiving"
"5390","       the approval of the Board of Trustee of the applicable Fund's Trust to"
"5391","       remove or amend such Waiver. Invesco will not have any right to"

"5393","   Subject to the foregoing paragraphs, Invesco agrees to review the"

"5399","   It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Trusts hereunder shall"
