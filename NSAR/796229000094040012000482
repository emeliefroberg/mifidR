"2109","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2110","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of The GAMCO"
"2111","Westwood Funds"
"2112","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"2113","statements of the GAMCO Westwood Funds (comprised of"
"2114","GAMCO Westwood Equity Fund, GAMCO Westwood Balanced Fund,"
"2115","GAMCO Westwood Intermediate Bond Fund, GAMCO Westwood"
"2116","SmallCap Equity Fund, GAMCO Westwood Income Fund and"
"2117","GAMCO Westwood Mighty MitesSM Fund, hereafter referred to"
"2118","as the Funds) as of and for the year ended"
"2119","September 30, 2012, in accordance with the standards of"
"2120","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"2121","States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"2122","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"2123","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"2124","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"2125","the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2126","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2127","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"2128","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"2129","we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2130","Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"2131","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"2132","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"2133","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"2134","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"2135","required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"2136","costs of controls.  A funds' internal control over"
"2137","financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"2138","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2139","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2140","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"2141","generally accepted accounting principles.  A funds'"
"2142","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"2143","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2144","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"2145","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2146","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"2147","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2148","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"2149","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2150","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"2151","fund are being made only in accordance with"
"2152","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund;"
"2153","and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"2154","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"2155","acquisition, use or disposition of a funds' assets that"
"2156","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2157","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"2158","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2159","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2160","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"2161","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2162","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2163","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2164","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"2165","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2166","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"2167","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2168","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is"
"2169","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"2170","internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"2171","there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"2172","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial"
"2173","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"2174","basis."
"2175","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"2176","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"2177","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"2178","all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"2179","reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"2180","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"2181","Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"2182","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over"
"2183","financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"2184","over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"2185","material weaknesses as defined above as of September 30,"
"2186","2012."
"2187","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"2188","use of management and the Board of Trustees of the Funds"
"2189","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"2190","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"2191","than these specified parties."

"2473","(provided that a majority of such Trustees then in office act"
"2474","on the matter), upon a determination, based upon a review of"
"2475","readily available facts (but not a full trial-type inquiry)"
"2476","that such Covered Person acted in good faith in the reasonable"
"2477","belief that such Covered Person's action was in the best"
"2478","interests of the Trust and is not liable to the Trust or its"
"2479","Shareholders by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith,"
"2480","gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved"
"2481","in the conduct of such Covered Person's office, or (b) there"
"2482","has been obtained an opinion in writing of independent legal"
"2483","counsel, based upon a review of readily available facts (but"
"2484","not a full trial-type inquiry) to the effect that such Covered"
"2485","Person appears to have acted in good faith in the reasonable"
"2486","belief that such Covered Person's action was in the best"
"2487","interests of the Trust and that such indemnification would not"
"2488","protect such Covered Person against any liability to the Trust"
"2489","to which such Covered Person would otherwise be subject by"
"2490","reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or"
"2491","reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of"
"2492","his office. Any approval pursuant to this Section shall not"
"2493","prevent the recovery from any Covered Person of any amount"
"2494","paid to such Covered Person in accordance with this Section as"
"2495","indemnification if such Covered Person is subsequently"
"2496","adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction not to have"
"2497","acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that such Covered"
"2498","Person's action was in the best interests of the Trust or to"
"2499","have been liable to the Trust or its Shareholders by reason of"
"2500","willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless"
"2501","disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such"
"2502","Covered Person's office."
"2503","            10.3 	Indemnification Not Exclusive. The right of indemnification"
"2504","hereby provided shall not be exclusive of or"
"2505","affect any other rights to which any such Covered Person may"
"2506","be entitled. As used in this Article 10, the term Covered Person"
"2507","shall include such person's heirs, executors and administrators,"
"2508","and a disinterested person is a person against whom none of the actions,"
"2509","suits or other proceedings in question or another action,"
"2510","suit, or other proceeding on the same or similar grounds is then"
"2511","or has been pending. Nothing contained in this article shall affect"
"2512","any rights to indemnification to which personnel of the Trust,"
"2513","other than Trustees and officers, and other persons may be"
"2514","entitled by contract or otherwise under law, nor the power of"
"2515","the Trust to purchase and maintain liability insurance on"
"2516","behalf of such person."
"2517","            10.4 	Limitation: Notwithstanding any provisions in the"

"2519","all such provisions are limited by the following undertaking set"
"2520","forth in the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange"
"2521","Commission: In the event that a claim for indemnification is"
"2522","asserted by a Trustee, officer or controlling person of the"
"2523","Trust in connection with the registered securities of the Trust,"
"2524","the Trust will not make such indemnification unless (i) the Trust"
"2525","has submitted, before a court or other body, the question of"
"2526","whether the person to be indemnified was liable by reason of"
"2527","willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless"
"2528","disregard of duties, and has obtained a final decision on the"
"2529","merits that such person was not liable by reason of such"
"2530","conduct or (ii) in the absenceof such decision, the Trust"
"2531","shall have obtained a reasonable determination, based upon a"
"2532","review of the facts, that such person was not liable by virtue"
"2533","of such conduct, by (a) the vote of a majority of Trustees who"
"2534","are neither interested persons as such term is defined in the"
"2535","Investment Company Act of 1940, nor parties to the proceeding"
"2536","or (b) an independent legal counsel in a written opinion. The"
"2537","Trust will not advance attorneys' fees or other expenses"
"2538","incurred by the person to be indemnified unless the Trust"
"2539","shall have (i) received an undertaking by or on behalf of such"
"2540","person to repay the advance unless it is ultimately determined"
"2541","that such person is entitled to indemnification and one of the"
"2542","following conditions shall have occurred: (x) such person"
"2543","shall provide security for his undertaking, (y) the Trust"
"2544","shall be insured against losses arising by reason of any"
"2545","lawful advances or (z) a majority of the disinterested, non-"
"2546","party Trustees of the Trust, or an independent legal counsel"
"2547","in a written opinion, shall have determined that based on a"
"2548","review of readily available facts there is reason to believe"
"2549","that such person ultimately will be found entitled to"
"2550","indemnification."
