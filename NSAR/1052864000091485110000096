"1376","ended December 31, 2009, in accordance with the standards"
"1377","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1378","States), we considered the Company's internal control"
"1379","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1380","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1381","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1382","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"

"1386","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"

"1389","The management of the Company is responsible for"
