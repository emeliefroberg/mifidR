"1072","of expressing our opinion on the financial"

"1077","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1078","Management of the Fund is responsible for"

"1082","management are required to assess the expected"

"1084","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"1085","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1086","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1087","preparation of financial statements for external"
"1088","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1089","accounting principles. A Fund's internal control"
"1090","over financial reporting includes those policies and"

"1092","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1093","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1094","the assets of the Fund; (2) provide reasonable"

"1103","of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of"
"1104","the Fund's assets that could have a material effect"
"1105","on the financial statements."
"1106","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
