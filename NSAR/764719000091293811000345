"542","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"543","To the Board of Trustees of MFS"
"544","Series Trust XV and the Shareholders of MFS Commodity Strategy Fund: In planning"
"545","and performing our audits of the financial  statements of MFS Commodity Strategy"
"546","Fund (one of the series of MFS Series Trust XV) (the  Trust) as of and for the"
"547","year ended  April 30,  2011,  in  accordance  with the  standards  of the Public"
"548","Company  Accounting  Oversight Board (United States),  we considered the Trust's"
"549","internal control over financial reporting,  including controls over safeguarding"
"550","securities,  as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"551","expressing  our  opinion  on the  financial  statements  and to comply  with the"
"552","requirements of Form N-SAR,  but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"553","the  effectiveness  of the Trust's  internal  control over financial  reporting."
"554","Accordingly,  we  express  no such  opinion.  The  management  of the  Trust  is"
"555","responsible for  establishing  and maintaining  effective  internal control over"
"556","financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,  estimates and judgments"
"557","by management are required to assess the expected  benefits and related costs of"
"558","controls.  A trust's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting is a process"
"559","designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"560","reporting and the preparation of financial  statements for external  purposes in"
"561","accordance with generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A trust's internal"
"562","control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"563","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"564","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the trust; (2)"
"565","provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to"
"566","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"567","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the trust are being"
"568","made only in accordance  with  authorizations  of management and trustees of the"
"569","trust;  and (3) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or timely"
"570","detection of unauthorized  acquisition,  use, or disposition of a trust's assets"
"571","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"572","Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting"
"573","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"574","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"575","inadequate  because of changes in  conditions  or that the degree of  compliance"
"576","with the  policies or  procedures  may  deteriorate.  A  deficiency  in internal"
"577","control  over  financial  reporting  exists  when the design or  operation  of a"
"578","control  does not  allow  management  or  employees,  in the  normal  course  of"
"579","performing  their assigned  functions,  to prevent or detect  misstatements on a"
"580","timely  basis.  A  material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or a  combination  of"
"581","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"582","reasonable  possibility  that a material  misstatement  of the trust's annual or"
"583","interim  financial  statements  will not be  prevented  or  detected on a timely"
"584","basis."
"585","Our  consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial  reporting was"
"586","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in the  first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"587","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"588","weaknesses  under  standards   established  by  the  Public  Company  Accounting"
"589","Oversight  Board.  However,  we  noted  no"
"590","deficiencies in the Trust's  internal  control over financial  reporting and its"
"591","operation,  including controls for safeguarding securities,  that we consider to"
"592","be a material weakness, as defined above, as of April 30, 2011."
"593","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"594","Board of  Trustees  of MFS  Series  Trust  XV and the  Securities  and  Exchange"
"595","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"596","these specified parties."
