"510","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"511","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"512","Putnam Tax Exempt Income Fund:"
"513","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"514","of Putnam Tax Exempt Income Fund (the Fund), as of and for the"
"515","year ended September 30, 2014, in accordance with the standards"
"516","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"517","we considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"518","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"519","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"520","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"521","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"522","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"523","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"524","such opinion."
"525","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"526","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"527","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"528","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"529","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"530","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"531","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"532","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"533","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"534","A companys internal control over financial reporting includes"
"535","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"536","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"537","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"538","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"539","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"540","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"541","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"542","with authorizations of management and trustees of the company;"
"543","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"544","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"545","of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the"
"546","financial statements."
"547","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"548","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"549","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"550","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"551","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"552","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"553","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"554","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"555","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"556","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"557","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"558","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"559","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"560","material misstatement of a Funds annual or interim financial"
"561","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"562","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"563","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"564","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"565","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"566","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"567","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"568","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"569","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"570","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"571","September 30, 2014."
"572","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"573","management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam Tax Exempt Income"
"574","Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"575","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"576","specified parties."

"629","Agreement and Declaration of Trust and Principal Office"
"630","      1.1  Agreement and Declaration of Trust.  These Bylaws shall"
"631","be subject to the Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as from"
"632","time to time in effect (the  Declaration of Trust ), of the"
"633","Massachusetts business trust established by the Declaration of"
"634","Trust (the  Trust ).  Capitalized terms used but not defined in"
"635","these Bylaws have the meanings given to them in the Declaration"
"636","of Trust."
"637","      1.2  Principal Office of the Trust.  The principal office of"
"638","the Trust shall be located in Boston, Massachusetts.  The Trust"
"639","may have other principal offices within or without the"
"640","Commonwealth of Massachusetts as the Trustees may from time to"
"641","time determine."
"642","ARTICLE 2"
"643","Meetings of Trustees"
"644","      2.1  Regular Meetings.  Regular meetings of the Trustees may"
"645","be held without call or notice at such places and at such times"
"646","as the Trustees may from time to time determine, provided that"
"647","notice of the first regular meeting following any such"
"648","determination shall be given to absent Trustees."
"649","      2.2  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Trustees may"
"650","be held at any time and at any place designated in the call of"
"651","the meeting when called by the Chair of the Trustees, the"
"652","President, the Executive Vice President or the Treasurer or by"
"653","two or more Trustees, sufficient notice thereof being given to"
"654","each Trustee by the Clerk or an Assistant Clerk or by the officer"
"655","or the Trustees calling the meeting."
"656","      2.3  Notice of Special Meetings.  It shall be sufficient"
"657","notice to a Trustee of a special meeting: (a) to send notice (i)"
"658","by mail at least forty-eight hours before the meeting, (ii) by"
"659","courier at least forty-eight hours before the meeting, (iii) by"
"660","electronic mail (e-mail), facsimile or other electronic means at"
"661","least twenty-four hours before the meeting, in each case,"
"662","addressed to the Trustee at his or her usual or last known"
"663","business or residence address (or e-mail address, facsimile"
"664","number or other appropriate address); or (b) to give notice to"
"665","him or her in person or by telephone at least twenty-four hours"
"666","before the meeting.  Notice of a special meeting need not be"
"667","given to any Trustee if a written waiver of notice, executed by"
"668","him or her before or after the meeting, is filed with the records"
"669","of the meeting, or to any Trustee who attends the meeting without"
"670","protesting before or at its commencement the lack of notice to"
"671","him or her.  Any written waiver of notice may be provided and"
"672","delivered to the Trust by mail, courier, e-mail, facsimile or"
"673","other electronic means. Neither notice of a meeting nor a waiver"
"674","of a notice need specify the purposes of the meeting.  All"
"675","notices shall be deemed to be given when sent."
"676","      2.4  Quorum.  At any meeting of the Trustees a majority of"
"677","the Trustees then in office shall constitute a quorum.  Once a"
"678","quorum has been validly established for a meeting, it cannot be"
"679","broken by Trustees withdrawing from the meeting.  Any meeting may"
"680","be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the votes cast"
"681","upon the question, whether or not a quorum is present, and the"
"682","meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice."
"683","      2.5  Telephone Meeting; Action Without a Meeting.  Except as"
"684","otherwise provided in the Declaration of Trust and these Bylaws,"
"685","any action to be taken by the Trustees may be taken by a majority"
"686","of the Trustees present at the meeting of the Trustees (a quorum"
"687","being present), including any meeting held by means of a"
"688","conference telephone or other communications equipment by means"
"689","of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each"
"690","other at the same time and participation by such means shall"
"691","constitute presence in person at a meeting. Any action to be"
"692","taken by the Trustees may also be taken without a meeting if one"
"693","or more written consents thereto are signed by a majority of the"
"694","Trustees.  Any written consent may be given by mail, courier, e-"
"695","mail, facsimile or other electronic means.  Copies of such"
"696","written consents shall be filed with the minutes of the"
"697","proceedings of the Trustees.  Such consents shall be treated for"
"698","all purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of the Trustees.  If in"
"699","accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust and"
"700","these Bylaws any action is taken by the Trustees by written"
"701","consents of less than all of the Trustees, then prompt notice of"
"702","any such action shall be furnished to each Trustee who did not"
"703","execute such written consent, provided that the effectiveness of"
"704","such action shall not be impaired by any delay or failure to"
"705","furnish such notice."
"706","ARTICLE 3"
"707","Officers"
"708","      3.1  Enumeration; Qualification.  The officers of the Trust"
"709","shall be a President, a Treasurer, a Clerk and such other"
"710","officers (including Vice President, which shall include the"
"711","office of Executive Vice President), if any, as the Trustees from"
"712","time to time may in their discretion elect.  The Trust may also"
"713","have such agents as the Trustees from time to time may in their"
"714","discretion appoint.  In addition, there shall be a Chair of the"
"715","Trustees, who will be considered an officer of the Trustees and"
"716","not of the Trust.  The Chair of the Trustees shall be a Trustee"
"717","and may but need not be a Shareholder; and any other officer may"
"718","but need not be a Trustee or a Shareholder.  Any two or more"
"719","offices may be held by the same person."
"720","      3.2  Election.  The Chair of the Trustees, the President,"
"721","the Treasurer and the Clerk shall be elected by the Trustees upon"
"722","the occurrence of any vacancy in any such office.  Other"
"723","officers, if any, may be elected or appointed by the Trustees at"
"724","any time.  Vacancies in any such other office may be filled at"
"725","any time."
"726","      3.3  Tenure.  The Chair of the Trustees, the President, the"
"727","Treasurer and the Clerk shall hold office in each case until he"
"728","or she dies, resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified.  Each"
"729","other officer shall hold office, and each agent shall retain"
"730","authority, at the pleasure of the Trustees. Notwithstanding the"
"731","foregoing, the tenure of any officer of the Trust who is an"
"732","employee or officer of the Trusts investment adviser or its"
"733","affiliates shall automatically terminate contemporaneously with"
"734","the termination of such persons employment with, or service as"
"735","officer of, the Trusts investment adviser and all of its"
"736","affiliates."
"737","      3.4  Powers.  Subject to the other provisions of these"
"738","Bylaws, each officer shall have, in addition to the duties and"
"739","powers set forth in these Bylaws and in the Declaration of Trust,"
"740","such duties and powers as are commonly incident to the office"
"741","occupied by him or her as if the Trust were organized as a"
"742","Massachusetts business corporation and such other duties and"
"743","powers as the Trustees may from time to time designate."
"744","      3.5  Chair.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide, the"
"745","Chair of the Trustees shall preside at all meetings of the"
"746","Trustees.  The Chair of the Trustees shall have such other duties"
"747","and powers relating to the operations of the Trustees as the"
"748","Trustees may from time to time designate, but shall have no"
"749","individual authority to act for the Trust as an officer of the"
"750","Trust.  The Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who"
"751","are not  interested persons  of the Trust, as that term is"
"752","defined in the 1940 Act, may appoint one or more persons to"
"753","perform the duties of the Chair of the Trustees in the event of"
"754","his or her absence at any meeting or in the event of his or her"
"755","disability.  The Chair of the Trustees shall also have the power"
"756","to appoint one or more persons to perform the duties of the Chair"
"757","of the Trustees in the event of his or her absence at any"
"758","meeting."
"759","      3.6  President.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by"
"760","vote or otherwise, the President shall be the principal executive"
"761","officer of the Trust."

"1167","expected of the Trustees."
"1168","      (b) 	The Manager, at its expense, except as such expense is"
"1169","paid by the Fund as provided in Section 1(d), will furnish (1)"
"1170","all necessary investment and management facilities, including"
"1171","salaries of personnel, required for it to execute its duties"
"1172","faithfully; (2) suitable office space for the Fund; and (3)"
"1173","administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical"
"1174","personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of"
"1175","the affairs of the Fund, including determination of the net asset"
"1176","value of the Fund, but excluding shareholder accounting services."
"1177","Except as otherwise provided in Section 1(d), the Manager will"
"1178","pay the compensation, if any, of the officers of the Fund."
"1179","      (c) 	The Manager, at its expense, will place all orders for"
"1180","the purchase and sale of portfolio investments for the Funds"
"1181","account with brokers or dealers selected by the Manager. In the"
"1182","selection of such brokers or dealers and the placing of such"
"1183","orders, the Manager will use its best efforts to obtain for the"
"1184","Fund the most favorable price and execution available, except to"
"1185","the extent it may be permitted to pay higher brokerage"
"1186","commissions for brokerage and research services as described"
"1187","below. In using its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the most"
"1188","favorable price and execution available, the Manager, bearing in"
"1189","mind the Funds best interests at all times, will consider all"
"1190","factors it deems relevant, including by way of illustration,"
"1191","price, the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for"
"1192","the security, the amount of the commission, the timing of the"
"1193","transaction taking into account market prices and trends, the"
"1194","reputation, experience and"
"1195","financial stability of the broker or dealer involved and the"
"1196","quality of service rendered by the broker or dealer in other"
"1197","transactions. Subject to such policies as the Trustees of the"
"1198","Fund may determine, the Manager will not be deemed to have acted"
"1199","unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this Contract"
"1200","or otherwise solely by reason of its having caused the Fund to"
"1201","pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and research"
"1202","services to the Manager an amount of commission for effecting a"
"1203","portfolio investment transaction in excess of the amount of"
"1204","commission another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"1205","effecting that transaction, if the Manager determines in good"
"1206","faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation"
"1207","to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by"
"1208","such broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular"
"1209","transaction or the Managers overall responsibilities with respect"
"1210","to the Fund and to other clients of the Manager as to which the"
"1211","Manager exercises investment discretion. The Manager agrees that"
"1212","in connection with purchases or sales of portfolio investments"
"1213","for the Funds account, neither the Manager nor any officer,"
"1214","director, employee or agent of the Manager shall act as a"
"1215","principal or receive any commission other than as provided in"
"1216","Section 3."
"1217","      (d) 	The Fund will pay or reimburse the Manager for the"
"1218","compensation in whole or in part of such officers of the Fund and"
"1219","persons assisting them as may be determined from time to time by"
"1220","the Trustees of the Fund. The Fund will also pay or reimburse the"
"1221","Manager for all or part of the cost of suitable office space,"
"1222","utilities, support services and equipment attributable to such"
"1223","officers and persons as may be determined in each case by the"
"1224","Trustees of the Fund. The Fund will pay the fees, if any, of the"
"1225","Trustees of the Fund."
"1226","      (e) 	The Manager will not be obligated to pay any expenses"
"1227","of or for the Fund not expressly assumed by the Manager pursuant"
"1228","to this Section 1 other than as provided in Section 3."
"1229","      (f) 	Subject to the prior approval of a majority of the"
"1230","Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who are not"
"1231","interested persons  and, to the extent required by the 1940 Act"
"1232","and the rules and regulations under the 1940 Act, subject to any"
"1233","applicable guidance or interpretation of the Securities and"
"1234","Exchange Commission or its staff, by the shareholders of the Fund,"
"1235","the Manager may, from time to time, delegate to a sub-adviser or"
"1236","sub-administrator any of the Managers duties under this Contract,"
"1237","including the management of all or a portion of the assets being"
"1238","managed. In all instances, however, the Manager must oversee the"
"1239","provision of delegated services, the Manager must bear the"
"1240","separate costs of employing any sub-adviser or sub-administrator,"
"1241","and no delegation will relieve the Manager of any of its"
"1242","obligations under this Contract."
"1243","2. 	OTHER AGREEMENTS, ETC."
"1244","      It is understood that any of the shareholders, Trustees,"
"1245","officers and employees of the Fund may be a shareholder, director,"
"1246","officer or employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the"
"1247","Manager, and in any person controlled by or under common control"

"1254","business."

"1257","Managers services rendered, for the facilities furnished and for"
"1258","the expenses borne by the Manager pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b),"
"1259","and (c) of Section 1, a fee, based on the Funds Average Net"
"1260","Assets, computed and paid monthly at the annual rates set forth"
"1261","on Schedule B attached to this Contract, as from time to time"
"1262","amended. The Funds  Average Net Assets  means the average of all"
"1263","of the determinations of the Funds net asset value at the close"
"1264","of business on each business day during each month while this"
"1265","Contract is in effect. The fee is payable for each month within"
"1266","15 days after the close of the month."

"1269","similar payments received by the Manager or any affiliated person"

"1271","portfolio investments of the Fund, less any direct expenses"
"1272","approved by the Trustees incurred by the Manager or any"
"1273","affiliated person of the Manager in connection with obtaining"
"1274","such payments."
"1275","      In the event that expenses of the Fund for any fiscal year"
"1276","exceed the expense limitation on investment company expenses"
"1277","imposed by any statute or regulatory authority of any"
"1278","jurisdiction in which shares of the Fund are qualified for offer"
"1279","or sale, the compensation due the Manager for such fiscal year"
"1280","will be reduced by the amount of excess by a reduction or refund"
"1281","thereof. In the event that the expenses of the Fund exceed any"
"1282","expense limitation which the Manager may, by written notice to"
"1283","the Fund, voluntarily declare to be effective subject to such"
"1284","terms and conditions as the Manager may prescribe in such notice,"
"1285","the compensation due the Manager will be reduced, and if"
"1286","necessary, the Manager will assume expenses of the Fund, to the"
"1287","extent required by the terms and conditions of such expense"
"1288","limitation."
"1289","      If the Manager serves for less than the whole of a month,"
"1290","the foregoing compensation will be prorated."
"1291","4. 	ASSIGNMENT TERMINATES THIS CONTRACT; AMENDMENTS OF THIS"
"1292","CONTRACT."
"1293","      This Contract will automatically terminate, without the"
"1294","payment of any penalty, in the event of its assignment, provided"
"1295","that no delegation of responsibilities by the Manager pursuant to"

"1297","provision of this Contract may be changed, waived, discharged or"
"1298","terminated orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by"
"1299","the party against which enforcement of the change, waiver,"

"1488","SUB-MANAGEMENT CONTRACT"
"1489","      This Sub-Management Contract is dated as of February 27,"
"1490","2014 between PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC, a Delaware"
"1491","limited liability company (the  Manager ) and PUTNAM INVESTMENTS"
"1492","LIMITED, a company organized under the laws of England and Wales"
"1493","(the  Sub-Manager )."
"1494","      WHEREAS, the Manager is the investment manager of each of"
"1495","the investment companies registered under the United States"
"1496","Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, that are identified"
"1497","on Schedule A hereto, as it may from time to time be amended by"
"1498","the Manager (the  Funds ), and a registered investment adviser"
"1499","under the United States Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as"
"1500","amended;"
"1501","      WHEREAS, the Sub-Manager is licensed as an investment"
"1502","manager by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom"
"1503","(the  FCA ); and"
"1504","      WHEREAS, the Manager desires to engage the Sub-Manager from"
"1505","time to time to manage a portion of certain of the Funds:"
"1506","      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants"
"1507","herein contained, it is agreed as follows:"
"1508","1.	SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY SUB-MANAGER."
"1509","      (a)	The Sub-Manager, at its expense, will furnish"
"1510","continuously an investment program for that portion of any Fund"
"1511","the management of which is allocated from time to time by the"
"1512","Manager to the Sub-Manager (an  Allocated Sleeve ). The Manager"
"1513","shall, in its sole discretion, determine which Funds will have an"
"1514","Allocated Sleeve and the amount of assets allocated from time to"
"1515","time to each such Allocated Sleeve; provided that, with respect"
"1516","to any Fund, the Trustees of such Fund must have approved the use"
"1517","of the Sub-Manager prior to the creation of an Allocated Sleeve"
"1518","for such Fund. The Sub-Manager will determine what investments"
"1519","shall be purchased, held, sold or exchanged by any Allocated"
"1520","Sleeve and what portion, if any, of the assets of the Allocated"
"1521","Sleeve shall be held uninvested and shall, on behalf of the Fund,"
"1522","make changes in the Funds investments held in such Allocated"
"1523","Sleeve."
"1524","      (b)	The Manager may also, at its discretion, request the"
"1525","Sub-Manager to provide assistance with purchasing and selling"
"1526","securities for any Fund, including the placement of orders with"
"1527","broker-dealers selected in accordance with Section 1(d), even if"
"1528","the Manager has not established an Allocated Sleeve for such"
"1529","Fund."
"1530","      (c)	The Sub-Manager at its expense will furnish all"
"1531","necessary investment and management facilities, including"
"1532","salaries of personnel, required for it to execute its duties"
"1533","faithfully."
"1534","      (d)	The Sub-Manager shall place all orders for the purchase"
"1535","and sale of portfolio investments for any Allocated Sleeve with"
"1536","brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Manager. In the selection"
"1537","of such brokers or dealers and the placing of such orders, the"
"1538","Sub-Manager shall use its best efforts to obtain for the related"
"1539","Fund the most favorable price and execution available, except to"
"1540","the extent it may be permitted to pay higher brokerage"
"1541","commissions for brokerage and research services as described"
"1542","below. In using its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the most"
"1543","favorable price and execution available, the Sub-Manager, bearing"
"1544","in mind the Funds best interests at all times, shall consider all"
"1545","factors it deems relevant, including by way of illustration,"
"1546","price, the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for"
"1547","the security, the amount of the commission, the timing of the"
"1548","transaction taking into account market prices and trends, the"
"1549","reputation, experience and financial stability of the broker or"
"1550","dealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the broker"
"1551","or dealer in other transactions. Subject to such policies as the"
"1552","Trustees of the Funds may determine, the Sub-Manager shall not be"
"1553","deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty"
"1554","created by this Contract or otherwise solely by reason of its"
"1555","having caused a Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides"
"1556","brokerage and research services to the Manager or the Sub-Manager"
"1557","an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"1558","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker"
"1559","or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if"
"1560","the Sub-Manager determines in good faith that such amount of"
"1561","commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"1562","brokerage and research services provided by such broker or"
"1563","dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"1564","its overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to"
"1565","other clients of the Manager or the Sub-Manager as to which the"
"1566","Manager or the Sub-Manager exercises investment discretion. The"
"1567","Sub-Manager agrees that in connection with purchases or sales of"
"1568","portfolio investments for any Fund, neither the Sub-Manager nor"
"1569","any officer, director, employee or agent of the Sub-Manager shall"
"1570","act as a principal or receive any commission other than as"
"1571","provided in Section 3."
"1572","      (e)	The Sub-Manager shall not be obligated to pay any"

"1666","respect to such Fund shall be reduced in the same proportion as"
"1667","the fee paid to the Manager with respect to such Fund is so"
"1668","reduced.  Measurement Period  shall be any period for which"
"1669","payments of interest or fees (whether designated as such or"

"2466","proportion to the number of Shares of such series held by each of"
"2467","them, except to the extent otherwise required or permitted by the"

"2472","of such class held by each of them.  Such distributions shall be"
"2473","made in cash, Shares or other property, or a combination thereof,"
"2474","as determined by the Trustees.  Any such distribution paid in"
"2475","Shares will be paid at the net asset value thereof as determined"

"2477","Redemptions and Repurchases"
"2478","      Section 2.	The Trust shall purchase such Shares as are offered"

"2482","designated by the Trust that the Trust purchase such Shares, or"

"2487","the Trustees.  Payment for said Shares shall be made by the Trust"
"2488","to the Shareholder within seven days after the date on which the"
"2489","request is made.  The obligation set forth in this Section 2 is"
"2490","subject to the provision that in the event that at any time the"

"2497","period permitted by order of the Securities and Exchange"
"2498","Commission for the protection of investors, such obligation may"
"2499","be suspended or postponed by the Trustees.  The Trust may also"
"2500","purchase or repurchase Shares at a price not exceeding the net"

"2507","such payment shall be determined by the Trust in its sole"
"2508","discretion, and the Trust shall have no obligation to effect a"
"2509","pro rata division of cash or other property in making any such"
"2510","payment.  In no event shall the Trust be liable for any delay of"
"2511","any other person in transferring securities or other property"

"2517","at such time such Shareholder owns fewer Shares than, or Shares"
"2518","having an aggregate net asset value of less than, an amount"
"2519","determined from time to time by the Trustees, in which case the"
"2520","Trust may redeem all Shares owned by such Shareholder or only so"

"2522","for any fee fixed from time to time by the Trustees for the"
"2523","maintenance of small accounts; (ii) to the extent that such"
"2524","Shareholder owns Shares of a particular series of Shares equal to"
"2525","or in excess of a percentage of the outstanding Shares of that"
"2526","series determined from time to time by the Trustees; (iii) to the"
"2527","extent that such Shareholder owns Shares of the Trust"
"2528","representing a percentage equal to or in excess of such"
"2529","percentage of the aggregate number of outstanding Shares of the"
"2530","Trust or the aggregate net asset value of the Trust determined"
"2531","from time to time by the Trustees; (iv) if such Shareholder fails"
"2532","to supply appropriate personal and tax identification information"
"2533","requested by the Trust; (v) if such Shareholder fails to meet or"
"2534","maintain the qualifications for ownership of a particular series"
"2535","or class; or (vi) if the Trustees determine for any other reason,"
"2536","in their sole discretion, that the ownership of Shares by a"
"2537","Shareholder is not in the best interests of the remaining"
"2538","Shareholders of the Trust or of the applicable series or class."

"2590","or administrative or legislative or other body, in which such"
"2591","Covered Person may be or may have been involved as a party or"
"2592","otherwise or with which such Covered Person may be or may have"
"2593","been threatened, while in office or thereafter, by reason of"
"2594","being or having been such a Covered Person except with respect to"
"2595","any matter as to which such Covered Person shall have been"
"2596","finally adjudicated in any such action, suit or other proceeding"
"2597","(a) not to have acted in good faith, (b) not to have acted in the"
"2598","reasonable belief that such Covered Persons action was in the"

"2601","proceeding, to have had reasonable cause to believe his or her"
"2602","action was unlawful or (d) to be liable to the Trust or its"

"2604","negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the"
"2605","conduct of such Covered Persons office (each of such exceptions"

"2613","Trust if it is ultimately determined that indemnification of such"

"2615","that either (a) such Covered Person shall have provided"
"2616","appropriate security for such undertaking, (b) the Trust shall be"
"2617","insured against losses arising from any such advance payments or"

"2622","of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial type"
"2623","inquiry) that there is reason to believe that such Covered Person"
"2624","will be found entitled to indemnification under this Article. In"
"2625","making any such determination, the disinterested Trustees or such"
"2626","counsel, as the case may be, shall afford the Covered Person a"
"2627","rebuttable presumption that the Covered Person did not engage in"

"2633","which the action, suit, or proceeding was brought, that such"
"2634","Covered Person engaged in Disabling Conduct, indemnification"
"2635","shall be provided if (a) approved as in the best interests of the"
"2636","Trust, after notice that it involves such indemnification, by at"
"2637","least a majority of the disinterested Trustees acting on the"
"2638","matter (provided that a majority of the disinterested Trustees"
"2639","then in office act on the matter) upon a determination, based"
"2640","upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full"
"2641","trial type inquiry) that such Covered Person did not engage in"
"2642","Disabling Conduct, or (b) there has been obtained an opinion in"
"2643","writing of independent legal counsel, based upon a review of"
"2644","readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial type inquiry)"
"2645","to the effect that such Covered Person did not engage in"
"2646","Disabling Conduct.  Any approval pursuant to this Section shall"
"2647","not prevent the recovery from any Covered Person of any amount"

"2649","indemnification if such Covered Person is subsequently"
"2650","adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction not to have"
"2651","engaged in Disabling Conduct."
"2652","Right Not Exclusive"
"2653","      Section 3.	The right of indemnification hereby provided shall"

"2668","the Trust to purchase and maintain liability insurance on behalf"
