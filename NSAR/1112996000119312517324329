"4365","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"4366","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Counselor Series Trust"
"4367","(Invesco Counselor Series Trust):"
"4368","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of each of"
"4369","the following fourteen funds:"
"4370","Invesco American Franchise Fund          Invesco Growth and Income Fund"
"4371","Invesco California Tax-Free Income Fund  Invesco Low Volatility Equity Yield"
"4372","                                         Fund"
"4373","Invesco Core Plus Bond Fund              Invesco Pennsylvania Tax Free Income"
"4374","Invesco Equally-Weighted S&P 500 Fund    Invesco S&P 500 Index Fund"
"4375","Invesco Equity and Income Fund           Invesco Short Duration High Yield"
"4376","                                         Municipal Fund"
"4377","Invesco Floating Rate Fund               Invesco Small Cap Discovery Fund"
"4378","Invesco Global Real Estate Income Fund   Invesco Strategic Real Return Fund"
"4379","(hereafter collectively referred to as the Funds), as of and for the year"
"4380","ended August 31, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"4381","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"4382","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"4383","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"4384","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"4385","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"4386","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"4387","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"4388","internal control over financial reporting."
"4389","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"4390","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"4391","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"4392","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"4393","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"4394","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"4395","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"4396","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"4397","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"4398","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"4399","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"4400","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"4401","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"4402","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"4403","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"4404","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"4405","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"4406","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"4407","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"4408","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"4409","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"4410","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"4411","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4412","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"4413","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"4414","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"4415","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"4416","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"4417","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"4418","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"4419","on a timely basis."
"4420","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"4421","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"4422","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"4423","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"4424","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"4425","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"4426","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"4427","be material weaknesses as defined above as of August 31, 2017."

"5542","          AIM Counselor Series Trust (Invesco Counselor Series Trust)"
"5543","On April 4, 2017, AIM Counselor Series Trust (Invesco Counselor Series Trust)"
"5544","(the Trust) commenced operations of Class R6 shares for the Invesco Low"
"5545","Volatility Equity Yield Fund, Invesco Pennsylvania Tax Free Income Fund,"
"5546","Invesco California Tax-Free Income Fund, Invesco S&P 500 Index Fund and Invesco"
"5547","Short Duration High Yield Municipal Fund (the Funds). Class R6 shares are"
"5548","sold at net asset value, and are not subject to an initial sales charge or to a"
"5549","CDSC. Shares of beneficial interest of the Trust are redeemable at their net"
"5550","asset value at the option of the shareholder or at the option of the Trust, in"
"5551","accordance with any applicable provisions of the Trust Agreement and applicable"
"5552","law, subject in certain circumstances to a contingent deferred sales charge."
"5553","Each share of a Fund generally has the same voting, dividend, liquidation and"
"5554","other rights; however, each class of shares of a Fund is subject to different"
"5555","sales loads, conversion features, exchange privileges and class-specific"
"5556","expenses. Only shareholders of a specific class may vote on matters relating to"
"5557","that class's distribution plan. Shareholders of each Fund are entitled to one"
"5558","vote per share (with proportionate voting for fractional shares), irrespective"
"5559","of the relative net asset value of the shares of a Fund. However, on matters"
"5560","affecting an individual Fund or class of shares, a separate vote of"
"5561","shareholders of that Fund or class is required. Shareholders of a Fund or class"
"5562","are not entitled to vote on any matter which does not affect that Fund or class"
"5563","but that requires a separate vote of another Fund or class. An example of a"
"5564","matter that would be voted on separately by shareholders of each Fund is the"
"5565","approval of the advisory agreement with Invesco Advisers, Inc. (the Adviser or"
"5566","Invesco). When issued, shares of each Fund are fully paid and nonassessable,"
"5567","have no preemptive or subscription rights, and are freely transferable."
"5568","Class R6 shares do not have cumulative voting rights in connection with the"
"5569","election of Trustees or on any other matter. Upon any liquidation of the Trust,"
"5570","shareholders of each class are entitled to share pro rata in the net assets"
"5571","belonging to the applicable Fund allocable to such class available for"
"5572","distribution after satisfaction of, or reasonable provision for, the"
"5573","outstanding liabilities of the Fund allocable to such class."
"5574","Under Delaware law, shareholders of a Delaware statutory trust shall be"
"5575","entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to shareholders"
"5576","of private for-profit corporations organized under Delaware law. There is a"
"5577","remote possibility, however, that shareholders could, under certain"
"5578","circumstances, be held liable for the obligations of the Trust to the extent"
"5579","the courts of another state, which does not recognize such limited liability,"
"5580","were to apply the laws of such state to a controversy involving such"
"5581","obligations. The Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as amended or restated"
"5582","from time to time, (the Trust Agreement) disclaims shareholder personal"
"5583","liability for the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses of the Trust and"
"5584","requires that every undertaking of the Trust or the Board relating to the Trust"
"5585","or any Fund include a recitation limiting such obligation to the Trust and its"
"5586","assets or to one or more Funds and the assets belonging thereto. The Trust"
"5587","Agreement provides for indemnification out of the property of a Fund (or Class,"
"5588","as applicable) for all losses and expenses of any shareholder of such Fund held"
"5589","personally liable solely on account of being or having been a shareholder."

"6040","will be amended to reflect any such agreement."
"6041","   For the Voluntary Limits (listed in Exhibits A - D), Invesco agrees that"
