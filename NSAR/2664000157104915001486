"1027","31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1028","Portfolio&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1029","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"1030","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Portfolio&#8217;s internal control"

"1033","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>Management of the Portfolio is responsible"
"1034","for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"1035","and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"1036","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"1037","and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"1038","A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1039","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1040","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"1041","with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1042","and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1043","use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"1044","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>&nbsp;</P>"
"1045","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1046","control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"1047","to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1048","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"

"1050","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1051","reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1052","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"1053","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"1054","a material misstatement of the Portfolio&#8217;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
