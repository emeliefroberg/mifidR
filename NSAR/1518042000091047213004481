"473","17605 Wright Street"
"474","Omaha, Nebraska"
"475","68130"
"476","In planning and"
"477","performing our audit of"
"478","the financial statements"
"479","of The SFG Futures"
"480","Strategy Fund (the"
"481","Fund), a series of"
"482","Northern Lights Fund"
"483","Trust II as of and for the"
"484","year ended August 31,"
"485","2013, in accordance with"
"486","the standards of the"
"487","Public Company"
"488","Accounting Oversight"
"489","Board (United States),"
"490","we considered the"
"491","Fund's internal control"
"492","over financial reporting,"
"493","including controls over"
"494","safeguarding securities,"
"495","as a basis for designing"
"496","our auditing procedures"
"497","for the purpose of"
"498","expressing our opinion"
"499","on the financial"
"500","statements and to"
"501","comply with the"
"502","requirements of Form N-"
"503","SAR, but not for the"
"504","purpose of expressing an"
"505","opinion on the"
"506","effectiveness of the"
"507","Fund's internal control"
"508","over financial reporting."
"509","Accordingly, we express"
"510","no such opinion."
"511","The management of the"
"512","Fund is responsible for"
"513","establishing and"
"514","maintaining effective"
"515","internal control over"
"516","financial reporting.   In"
"517","fulfilling this"
"518","responsibility, estimates"
"519","and judgments by"
"520","management are"
"521","required to assess the"
"522","expected benefits and"
"523","related costs of controls."
"524","A company's internal"
"525","control over financial"
"526","reporting is a process"
"527","designed to provide"
"528","reasonable assurance"
"529","regarding the reliability"
"530","of financial reporting"
"531","and the preparation of"
"532","financial statements for"
"533","external purposes in"
"534","accordance with"
"535","generally accepted"
"536","accounting principles."
"537","A company's internal"
"538","control over financial"
"539","reporting includes those"
"540","policies and procedures"
"541","that (1) pertain to the"
"542","maintenance of records"
"543","that, in reasonable"
"544","detail, accurately and"
"545","fairly reflect the"
"546","transactions and"
"547","dispositions of the"
"548","assets of the company;"
"549","(2) provide reasonable"
"550","assurance that"
"551","transactions are"
"552","recorded as necessary"
"553","to permit preparation"
"554","of financial statements"
"555","in  accordance  with"
"556","generally  accepted"
"557","accounting  principles,"
"558","and  that  receipts  and"
"559","expenditures of the"
"560","company are being"
"561","made only in accordance"
"562","with authorizations of"
"563","management and"
"564","directors of the"
"565","company; and (3)"
"566","provide reasonable"
"567","assurance regarding"
"568","prevention or timely"
"569","detection of"
"570","unauthorized"
"571","acquisition, use or"
"572","disposition of a"
"573","company's assets that"
"574","could have a material"
"575","effect on the financial"
"576","statements."
"577","Because of inherent"
"578","limitations, internal"
"579","control over financial"
"580","reporting may not"
"581","prevent or detect"
"582","misstatements.   Also,"
"583","projections of any"
"584","evaluation of"
"585","effectiveness to future"
"586","periods are subject to"
"587","the risk that controls"
"588","may become"
"589","inadequate because of"
"590","changes in conditions,"
"591","or that the degree of"
"592","compliance with the"
"593","policies or procedures"
"594","may deteriorate."
"595","A deficiency in internal"
"596","control over financial"
"597","reporting exists when"
"598","the design or operation"
"599","of a control does not"
"600","allow management or"
"601","employees, in the normal"
"602","course of performing"
"603","their assigned functions,"
"604","to prevent or detect"
"605","misstatements on a"
"606","timely basis.   A"
"607","material weakness is a"
"608","deficiency, or"
"609","combination of"
"610","deficiencies, in internal"
"611","control over financial"
"612","reporting, such that there"
"613","is a reasonable"
"614","possibility that a"
"615","material misstatement"
"616","of the Fund's annual or"
"617","interim financial"
"618","statements will not be"
"619","prevented or detected"
"620","on a timely basis."

"626","Our consideration of"
"627","the Fund's internal"
"628","control over financial"
"629","reporting was for the"
"630","limited purpose"
"631","described in the first"
"632","paragraph and would not"
"633","necessarily disclose all"
"634","deficiencies in internal"
"635","control that might be"
"636","material weaknesses"
"637","under standards"
"638","established by the Public"
"639","Company Accounting"
"640","Oversight Board (United"
"641","States).   However, we"
"642","noted no deficiencies in"
"643","the Fund's internal"
"644","control over financial"
"645","reporting and its"
"646","operation, including"
"647","controls over"
"648","safeguarding securities"
"649","that we consider to be"
"650","material weaknesses as"
"651","defined above as of"
"652","August 31, 2013."
