"1652","To the Shareholders of BlackRock Allocation Target Shares:"
"1653","Series A Portfolio, BlackRock Allocation Target Shares: Series C"
"1654","Portfolio, BlackRock Allocation Target Shares: Series E"
"1655","Portfolio, BlackRock Allocation Target Shares: Series M"

"1660","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"1661","of BlackRock Allocation Target Shares: Series A Portfolio,"
"1662","BlackRock Allocation Target Shares: Series C Portfolio,"
"1663","BlackRock Allocation Target Shares: Series E Portfolio,"
"1664","BlackRock Allocation Target Shares: Series M Portfolio,"
"1665","BlackRock Allocation Target Shares: Series P Portfolio, and"
"1666","BlackRock Allocation Target Shares: Series S Portfolio,"
"1667","(collectively, the Funds), each a series of BlackRock"
"1668","Allocation Target Shares, as of and for the year ended March 31,"
"1669","2018, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1670","Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we"
"1671","considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"1672","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1673","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"1674","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1675","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1676","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"1677","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"1678","express no such opinion."
"1679","The management of the Funds' is responsible for establishing and"
"1680","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1681","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1682","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1683","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"1684","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1685","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1686","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1687","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"1688","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1689","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1690","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"1691","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1692","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1693","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1694","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1695","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1696","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1697","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"1698","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1699","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a company's"
"1700","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1701","statements."
"1702","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1703","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1704","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"

"3808","                  (b)	In order that the Fund may determine the"

"3846","required in order to be approved with respect to such series or class;"
"3847","provided, however, that as to any matter with respect to which a"
"3848","separate vote of any class or series of Shares is required by the"
"3849","1940 Act, such requirement as to a separate vote by that class or"
"3850","series of Shares shall apply in addition to a vote of all the affected"
"3851","classes and series voting together as a single class; provided,"
"3852","further, that except to the extent required by the 1940 Act, there"
"3853","shall be no separate class votes on the election or removal of"
"3854","Directors or the selection of auditors for the Fund and its series."
"3855","Shareholders of a particular class or series of Shares shall not be"
"3856","entitled to vote on any matter that affects only one or more other"
"3857","classes or series of Shares."

"3859","Charter, these Bylaws or a resolution of the Directors specifying"
"3860","a greater or a lesser vote requirement for the transaction of any"
"3861","item of business at any meeting of Shareholders, (i) the affirmative"
"3862","vote of a majority of the Shares present in person or represented"
"3863","by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act"
"3864","of the Shareholders with respect to any matter that properly comes"
"3865","before the meeting, and (ii) where a separate vote of two or more"
"3866","classes or series of Shares is required on any matter, the affirmative"
"3867","vote of a majority of the Shares of such class or series of Shares"
"3868","present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be"
"3869","the act of the Shareholders of such class or series with respect to"

"3871","                  (c)	Only Shareholders of record shall be entitled"
"3872","to vote.  Each full Share shall be entitled to one vote and fractional"
"3873","Shares shall be entitled to a vote of such fraction.  When any Share"
"3874","is held jointly by several persons, any one of them may vote at any"
"3875","meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Share, but if more"
"3876","than one of them shall be present at such meeting in person or by"
"3877","proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so present disagree"
"3878","as to any vote to be cast, such vote shall not be received in respect"
"3879","of such Share."
"3880","                  (d)	There shall be no cumulative voting in the"

"3883","entitled to vote on any matter at a meeting present in person or by"
"3884","proxy shall constitute a quorum at such meeting of the Shareholders"
"3885","for purposes of conducting business on such matter.  The holders of"
"3886","a majority of the outstanding Shares of the affected series or class"
"3887","on the record date present in person or by proxy shall constitute"
"3888","a quorum at any meeting of the Shareholders for purposes of conducting"
"3889","business on which a vote of Shareholders of such series or classes"
"3890","is being taken.  The absence from any meeting, in person or by proxy,"
"3891","of a quorum of Shareholders for action upon any given matter shall"
"3892","not prevent action at such meeting upon any other matter or matters"
"3893","which may properly come before the meeting, if there shall be present"
"3894","thereat, in person or by proxy, a quorum of Shareholders in respect"
"3895","of such other matters.  A quorum, once established, shall not be"
"3896","broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum."
"3897","If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any"
"3898","meeting of the Shareholders, the chairman of the meeting, shall have"
"3899","power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, in the manner provided"
"3900","in Section 7 of this Article I, until a quorum shall be present or"
"3901","represented."
"3902","            Section 11.	Proxies."
"3903","                  (a)	At any meeting of Shareholders, any holder of"
"3904","Shares entitled to vote thereat may vote by properly executed proxy,"
"3905","provided that no proxy shall be voted at any meeting unless it shall"
"3906","have been placed on file with the Secretary, or with such other"
"3907","officer or agent of the Fund as the Directors or Secretary may direct,"
"3908","for verification prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken."
"3909","Pursuant to a resolution of a majority of the Directors, proxies may"
"3910","be solicited in the name of one or more Directors or one or more of"
"3911","the officers or employees of the Fund.  No proxy shall be valid after"
"3912","the expiration of 11 months from the date thereof, unless otherwise"
"3913","provided in the proxy.  A proxy purporting to be executed by or on"
"3914","behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at"
"3915","or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall"
"3916","rest on the challenger.  If the holder of any such Share is a minor"
"3917","or a person of unsound mind, and subject to guardianship or to the"
"3918","legal control of any other person as regards the charge or management"
"3919","of such Share, such person may vote by their guardian or such other"
"3920","person appointed or having such control, and such vote may be given"
"3921","in person or by proxy."
"3922","                  (b)	Without limiting the manner in which a"
"3923","Shareholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such"
"3924","Shareholder as proxy, the following shall constitute a valid means"
"3925","by which a Shareholder may grant such authority:"
"3926","                  (i)	A Shareholder may execute a writing"
"3927","authorizing another person or persons to act for such"
"3928","Shareholder as proxy.  Execution may be accomplished by the"
"3929","Shareholder or such Shareholder's authorized officer, director,"
"3930","employee or agent signing such writing or causing such person's"
"3931","signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means,"
"3932","including, but not limited to, by facsimile or electronic"
"3933","signature."
"3934","                  (ii)	A Shareholder may authorize another person"
"3935","or persons to act for such Shareholder as proxy by transmitting"
"3936","or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or"
"3937","other means of electronic or telephonic transmission to the"
"3938","person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy"
"3939","solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like"
"3940","agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of"
"3941","the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such"
"3942","telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission"
"3943","must either set forth or be submitted with information from"
"3944","which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other"
"3945","electronic transmission was authorized by the Shareholder.  If"
"3946","it is determined that such telegrams, cablegrams or other"
"3947","electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors of election"
"3948","or, if there are no inspectors of election, such other persons"
"3949","making that determination shall specify the information on"
"3950","which they relied."
"3951","                  (c)	Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other"
"3952","reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission authorizing"
"3953","another person or persons to act as proxy for a Shareholder may be"
"3954","substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission"
"3955","for any and all purposes for which the original writing or"
"3956","transmission could be used; provided, however, that such copy,"
"3957","facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a"
"3958","complete reproduction of the entire original writing or"
"3959","transmission."
"3960","            Section 12.	Inspectors of Election."
"3961","                  (a)	In advance of any meeting of Shareholders, the"
"3962","Directors may appoint inspectors of election to act at the meeting"
"3963","or any adjournment thereof.  If inspectors of election are not so"
"3964","appointed, the person acting as Chairman of any meeting of"
"3965","Shareholders may, and on the request of any Shareholder or"
"3966","Shareholder proxy shall, appoint inspectors of election of the"
"3967","meeting.  The number of inspectors of election shall be either one"
"3968","or three.  If appointed at the meeting on the request of one or more"
"3969","Shareholders or proxies, a majority of Shares present shall determine"
"3970","whether one or three inspectors of election are to be appointed, but"
"3971","failure to allow such determination by the Shareholders shall not"
"3972","affect the validity of the appointment of inspectors of election."
"3973","In case any person appointed as inspector of election fails to appear"
"3974","or fails or refuses to act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment"
"3975","made by the Directors in advance of the convening of the meeting or"
"3976","at the meeting by the person acting as chairman.  Unless otherwise"
"3977","required by applicable law, inspectors may be officers, employees"
"3978","or agents of the Fund.  Each inspector, before entering upon the"
"3979","discharge of the duties of inspector, shall take and sign an oath"
"3980","faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict"
"3981","impartiality and according to the best of such inspector's ability."
"3982","                  (b)	The inspectors of election shall have the duties"
"3983","prescribed by law and shall determine the number of Shares"
"3984","outstanding, the Shares represented at the meeting, the existence"
"3985","of a quorum, the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies, shall"
"3986","receive votes, ballots or consents, shall hear and determine all"
"3987","challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the"
"3988","right to vote, shall count and tabulate all votes or consents,"
"3989","determine the results, and do such other acts as may be proper to"

"4449","ARTICLE IV"
"4450","LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION"
"4451","            Section 1.	No Personal Liability of Directors or Officers."
"4452","No Director, advisory board member or officer of the Fund shall be"
"4453","subject in such capacity to any personal liability whatsoever to any"
"4454","Person, save only liability to the Fund or its Shareholders arising"
"4455","from bad faith, willful misfeasance, gross negligence or reckless"
"4456","disregard for his or her duty to such Person; and, subject to the"
"4457","foregoing exception, all such Persons shall look solely to the assets"
"4458","of the Fund for satisfaction of claims of any nature arising in"
"4459","connection with the affairs of the Fund.  If any Director, advisory"
"4460","board member or officer, as such, of the Fund, is made a party to"
"4461","any suit or proceeding to enforce any such liability, subject to the"
"4462","foregoing exception, such person shall not, on account thereof, be"
"4463","held to any personal liability.  Any repeal or modification of the"
"4464","Charter or this Article IV Section 1 shall not adversely affect any"
"4465","right or protection of a Director, advisory board member or officer"
"4466","of the Fund existing at the time of such repeal or modification with"
"4467","respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or"
"4468","modification."
"4469","            Section 2.	Mandatory Indemnification."
"4470","                  (a)	The Fund hereby agrees, solely out of the assets"
"4471","of the affected series, to indemnify each person who is or was a"
"4472","Director, advisory board member or officer of the Fund (each such"
"4473","person being an Indemnitee)  to the full extent permitted under"
"4474","applicable law against any and all liabilities and expenses,"
"4475","including amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise"
"4476","or as fines and penalties, and legal fees and expenses reasonably"
"4477","incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with the defense or"
"4478","disposition of any action, suit or other proceeding, whether civil"
"4479","or criminal, before any court or administrative or investigative body"
"4480","in which such person may be or may have been involved as a party or"
"4481","otherwise or with which such person may be or may have been threatened,"
"4482","while acting in any capacity set forth in this Article IV by reason"
"4483","of having acted in any such capacity, whether such liability or"
"4484","expense is asserted before or after service, except with respect to"
"4485","any matter as to which such person shall not have acted in good faith"
"4486","in the reasonable belief that his or her action was in the best"
"4487","interest of the Fund or the respective series of the Fund or, in the"
"4488","case of any criminal proceeding, as to which such person shall have"
"4489","had reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful;"
"4490","provided, however, that no Indemnitee shall be indemnified hereunder"
"4491","against any liability to any person or any expense of such Indemnitee"
"4492","arising by reason of (i) willful misfeasance, (ii) bad faith, (iii)"
"4493","gross negligence, or (iv) reckless disregard of the duties involved"
"4494","in the conduct of the Indemnitee's position (the conduct referred"
"4495","to in such clauses (i) through (iv) being sometimes referred to herein"
"4496","as Disabling Conduct).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, with"
"4497","respect to any action, suit or other proceeding voluntarily"
"4498","prosecuted by any Indemnitee as plaintiff, indemnification shall be"
"4499","mandatory only if the prosecution of such action, suit or other"
"4500","proceeding by such Indemnitee (A) was authorized by a majority of"
"4501","the Directors or (B) was instituted by the Indemnitee to enforce his"
"4502","or her rights to indemnification hereunder in a case in which the"
"4503","Indemnitee is found to be entitled to such indemnification.  The"
"4504","termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order,"
"4505","settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its"
"4506","equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the"
"4507","person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person"
"4508","reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests"
"4509","of the Fund, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,"
"4510","had reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was"
"4511","unlawful."
"4512","                  (b)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, no"
"4513","indemnification shall be made hereunder unless there has been a"
"4514","determination (i) by a final decision on the merits by a court or"
"4515","other body of competent jurisdiction before whom the issue of"
"4516","entitlement to indemnification hereunder was brought that such"
"4517","Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder or, (ii) in the"
"4518","absence of such a decision, by (A) a majority vote of a quorum of"
"4519","those Directors who are both Independent Directors and not parties"
"4520","to the proceeding (Independent Non-Party Directors), that the"
"4521","Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder, or (B) if such"
"4522","quorum is not obtainable or even if obtainable, if such majority so"
"4523","directs, a Special Counsel in a written opinion concludes that the"
"4524","Indemnitee should be entitled to indemnification hereunder."
"4525","                  (c)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent"
"4526","that an Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise"
"4527","in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in"
"4528","defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be"
"4529","indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually"
"4530","and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith,"
"4531","without the necessity of authorization in the specific case."
"4532","                  (d)	The Fund shall make advance payments in"
"4533","connection with the expenses of defending any action with respect"
"4534","to which indemnification might be sought hereunder, to the full"
"4535","extent permitted under applicable law, only if the Fund receives a"
"4536","written affirmation by the Indemnitee of the Indemnitee's good faith"
"4537","belief that the standards of conduct necessary for indemnification"
"4538","have been met and a written undertaking by the Indemnitee to reimburse"
"4539","the Fund if it shall ultimately be determined that the standards of"
"4540","conduct necessary for indemnification have not been met and if a"
"4541","majority of the Directors determine that the applicable standards"
"4542","of conduct necessary for indemnification appear to have been met."
"4543","In addition, at least one of the following conditions must be met:"
"4544","(i) the Indemnitee shall provide adequate security for his or her"
"4545","undertaking, (ii) the Fund shall be insured against losses arising"
"4546","by reason of any lawful advances or (iii) a majority of a quorum of"
"4547","the Independent Non-Party Directors, or if such quorum is not"
"4548","obtainable or even if obtainable, if a majority vote of such quorum"
"4549","so direct, Special Counsel in a written opinion, shall conclude,"
"4550","based on a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full"
"4551","trial-type inquiry), that there is substantial reason to believe that"
"4552","the Indemnitee ultimately will be found entitled to indemnification."
"4553","                  (e)	The rights accruing to any Indemnitee under"
"4554","these provisions shall not exclude any other right which any person"
"4555","may have or hereafter acquire under the Charter, these Bylaws or any"
"4556","statute, insurance policy, agreement, vote of Shareholders or"
"4557","Independent Directors or any other right to which such person may"
"4558","be lawfully entitled."
"4559","                  (f)	Subject to any limitations provided by the 1940"
"4560","Act and the Charter, the Fund shall have the power and authority,"
"4561","solely out of the assets of the affected series of the Fund, to"
"4562","indemnify and provide for the advance payment of expenses to"
"4563","employees, agents and other Persons providing services to the Fund"
"4564","or serving in any capacity at the request of the Fund to the full"
"4565","extent permitted for corporations organized under the corporations"
"4566","laws of the state in which the Fund was formed, provided that such"
"4567","indemnification has been approved by a majority of the Directors."
"4568","                  (g)	Any repeal or modification of the Charter or"
"4569","Section 2 of this Article IV shall not adversely affect any right"
"4570","or protection of any person who is or was a Director, any advisory"
"4571","board member or any officer of the Fund existing at the time of such"
"4572","repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions occurring"
"4573","prior to such repeal or modification."
"4574","            Section 3.	Good Faith Defined; Reliance on Experts. For"
"4575","purposes of any determination under this Article IV, a person shall"
"4576","be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person"
"4577","reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Fund, or, with"
"4578","respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no"
"4579","reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful, if"
"4580","such person's action is based on the records or books of account of"
"4581","the Fund, or on information supplied to such person by the officers"
"4582","of the Fund in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal"
"4583","counsel for the Fund or on information or records given or reports"
"4584","made to the Fund by an independent certified public accountant or"
"4585","by an appraiser or other expert or agent selected with reasonable"
"4586","care by the Fund.  The provisions of this Article IV Section 3 shall"
"4587","not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances"
"4588","in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard"
"4589","of conduct set forth in this Article IV. Each Director and officer"
"4590","or employee of the Fund shall, in the performance of his or her duties,"
"4591","be fully and completely justified and protected with regard to any"
"4592","act or any failure to act resulting from reliance in good faith upon"
"4593","the books of account or other records of the Fund, upon an opinion"
"4594","of counsel, or upon reports made to the Fund by any of the Fund's"
"4595","officers or employees or by any advisor, administrator, manager,"
"4596","distributor, dealer, accountant, appraiser or other expert or"
"4597","consultant selected with reasonable care by the Directors, officers"

"4601","Expenses.  The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided"
"4602","by, or granted pursuant to, this Article IV or the Charter shall"
"4603","continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, advisory"
"4604","board member or officer of the Fund and shall inure to the benefit"
