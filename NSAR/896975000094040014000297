"1018","To the Shareholders of Tweedy, Browne Global Value Fund,"
"1019","Tweedy, Browne Global Value Fund II - Currency Unhedged,"
"1020","Tweedy, Browne Value Fund and"
"1021","Tweedy, Browne Worldwide High Dividend Yield Value Fund and"
"1022","the Board of Directors of Tweedy, Browne Fund Inc."
"1023","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"

"1025","Global Value Fund II - Currency Unhedged, Tweedy, Browne Value"
"1026","Fund and Tweedy, Browne Worldwide High Dividend Yield Value"
"1027","Fund (constituting Tweedy, Browne Fund Inc., hereafter referred"
"1028","to as the  Funds ) as of and for the year ended March 31,"
"1029","2014 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1030","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1031","Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1032","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1033","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1034","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1035","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1036","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"1037","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"1038","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"1039","internal control over financial reporting."
"1040","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1041","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1042","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1043","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1044","related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"1045","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1046","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1047","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1048","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1049","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1050","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1051","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1052","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1053","funds; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1054","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1055","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1056","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the funds are"
"1057","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1058","and directors of the funds; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"1059","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1060","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets"
"1061","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1062","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1063","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1064","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1065","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1066","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1067","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1068","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1069","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1070","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1071","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1072","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1073","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1074","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1075","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1076","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1077","Funds annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1078","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1079","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"1080","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1081","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1082","all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1083","reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"1084","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1085","Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"1086","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over"
"1087","financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"1088","over safeguarding securities that we consider to be"
"1089","material weaknesses as defined above as of March 31,"

"1107","1.The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Tribune"
"1108","Company (the Committee) initiated litigation against Tweedy,"
"1109","Browne Value Fund (the Value Fund) and thousands of other"
"1110","former public shareholders of Tribune Company, seeking to avoid"
"1111","and recover payments made to Tribune Company shareholders in"
"1112","connection with the 2007 leveraged buyout of Tribune Company."
"1113","Value Fund tendered its shares in a tender offer from Tribune"
"1114","Company and received proceeds of approximately $3.4 million. The"
"1115","Committee, who was replaced during 2012, as plaintiff in this"
"1116","action by a litigation trustee (the Litigation Trustee),"
"1117","alleges that the shareholder payments were made in violation of"
"1118","various laws prohibiting actual fraudulent transfers. A fifth"
"1119","amended complaint filed on August 1, 2013 by the Litigation"
"1120","Trustee, alleges no misconduct by Value Fund or any member of"
"1121","the putative defendant class of public shareholders. The outcome"
"1122","of the proceedings (the AFT Litigation) cannot be predicted at"
"1123","this time and no contingency has been recorded on the books of"
"1124","Value Fund."
"1125","Name of court in which proceedings were instituted:  United"
"1126","States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.  This"
"1127","proceeding was transferred by order of the United States"
"1128","Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to the United"
"1129","States District Court for the Southern District of New York on"
"1130","April 5, 2012 and remains pending. A scheduling order was"
"1131","entered by the Court on April 25, 2014 related to a motion to"
"1132","dismiss the entire case contemplated by certain primary"
"1133","defendants.  Briefing in connection with this potentially case"
"1134","dispositive motion is expected to be concluded by July 3, 2014."
"1135","Date instituted:  November 1, 2010."

"1139","2.In addition to the AFT Litigation, a second proceeding,"
"1140","commenced by certain holders of notes issued by Tribune Company,"
"1141","asserts litigation claims against Value Fund and other public"
"1142","shareholders of Tribune Company, seeking to recover payments"
"1143","made to Tribune Company shareholders in connection with the 2007"
"1144","leveraged buyout of Tribune Company. The plaintiffs in this"
"1145","second action allege that the shareholder payments were made in"
"1146","violation of various laws prohibiting constructive fraudulent"
"1147","transfers. The complaint alleges no misconduct by Value Fund or"
"1148","any member of the putative defendant class. The outcome of the"
"1149","proceedings (the Neise Litigation) cannot be predicted at this"
"1150","time and no contingency has been recorded on the books of Value"
"1151","Fund. On September 23, 2013, Judge Richard Sullivan issued a"
"1152","Memorandum and Order granting defendants' Omnibus Phase One"
"1153","Motion to Dismiss the state law fraudulent conveyance claims in"
"1154","the Neise Litigation on grounds that the automatic stay under"
"1155","Section 362(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code precludes fraudulent"
"1156","conveyance actions by individual creditors (like the plaintiffs"
"1157","in the Neise Litigation) as long as the Litigation Trustee in"
"1158","AFT Litigation continues to assert his avoidance powers.  During"
"1159","October, 2013, Judge Sullivan's decision was appealed by both"
"1160","plaintiffs and defendants to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the"
"1161","Second Circuit.  Those appeals are now pending and as of the"
"1162","date of this disclosure, the briefing has been substantially"
