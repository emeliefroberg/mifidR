"5180","statutory trust (the Trust)."
"5181","       WHEREAS, the Trust is registered as an open-end"
"5182","management investment company under the Investment"
"5183","Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act);"
"5184","       WHEREAS, pursuant to an Agreement between"

"5191","services to the Trust in connection with the management"
"5192","of all of the assets of each Portfolio, and the Sub-Adviser"
"5193","is willing to render such investment advisory services."
"5194","       NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound,"
"5195","the parties hereto agree as follows:"
"5196","1.	(a)	Subject to supervision and oversight"
"5197","by the Adviser and the Trust's Board of Trustees, the"
"5198","Sub-Adviser shall manage (i) the investment operations"
"5199","of the Portfolio, and (ii) the composition of such assets,"
"5200","including the purchase, retention and disposition thereof,"
"5201","in accordance with the Portfolio's investment objectives,"
"5202","policies and restrictions as stated in such Portfolio's"
"5203","Prospectus(es) (such Prospectus(es) and Statement(s)"
"5204","of Additional Information as currently in effect and as"
"5205","amended or supplemented from time to time, being"
"5206","herein called the Prospectus), and subject to the"
"5207","following understandings:"

"5209","supervision of each Portfolio's investments and"
"5210","determine from time to time what investments and"
"5211","securities will be purchased, retained or sold by"
"5212","such Portfolio and what portion of such assets will"
"5213","be invested or held uninvested in cash."

"5217","Trust's Prospectus and with the instructions and"
"5218","directions of the Adviser and of the Board of"
"5219","Trustees and will conform and comply with the"
"5220","requirements of the 1940 Act, the Internal Revenue"
"5221","Code of 1986, as amended, and all other applicable"
"5222","federal and state laws and regulations, as each is"
"5223","amended from time to time."
"5224","             (3)	The Sub-Adviser shall determine"
"5225","the securities to be purchased or sold with respect"
"5226","to the Portfolio and will place orders with or through"
"5227","such persons, brokers or dealers to carry out the"
"5228","policy with respect to brokerage set forth in such"
"5229","Portfolio's Registration Statement (as defined herein)"
"5230","and Prospectus or as the Board of Trustees or the"
"5231","Adviser may direct from time to time, in conformity"
"5232","with federal securities laws.  In providing the Portfolio"
"5233","with investment supervision, the Sub-Adviser will give"
"5234","primary consideration to securing the most favorable"
"5235","price and efficient execution.  Within the framework of"
"5236","this policy, the Sub-Adviser may consider the financial"
"5237","responsibility, research and investment information"
"5238","and other services provided by brokers or dealers"
"5239","who may effect or be a party to any such transaction"
"5240","or other transactions to which the Sub-Adviser's other"
"5241","clients may be a party.  It is understood that it is"
"5242","desirable for a Portfolio that the Sub-Adviser have"
"5243","access to (i) supplemental investment and market"
"5244","research and (ii) security and economic analysis"
"5245","provided by brokers who may execute brokerage"
"5246","transactions at a higher cost to the Portfolio than"
"5247","may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers"
"5248","on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and"
"5249","efficient execution.  Therefore, the Sub-Adviser is"
"5250","authorized to place orders for the purchase and sale"
"5251","of securities on behalf of each Portfolio with brokers,"
"5252","subject to review by the Trust's Board of Trustees"
"5253","from time to time with respect to the extent and"
"5254","continuation of this practice.  It is understood that"
"5255","the services provided by such brokers may be useful"
"5256","to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's"
"5257","services to other clients."
"5258","                    On occasions when the Sub-Adviser deems"
"5259","the purchase or sale of a security to be in the best"
"5260","interest of a Portfolio as well as other clients of the"
"5261","Sub-Adviser, the Sub-Adviser, to the extent permitted"
"5262","by applicable laws and regulations, may, but shall be"
"5263","under no obligation to, aggregate the securities to be"
"5264","so purchased or sold in order to obtain the most favorable"
"5265","price or lower brokerage commissions and efficient"
"5266","execution.  In such event, allocation of the securities"
"5267","so purchased or sold, as well as the expenses incurred"
"5268","in the transaction, will be made by the Sub-Adviser in the"
"5269","manner it considers to be the most equitable and"
"5270","consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Portfolio"
"5271","in question and to such other clients."
"5272","             (4)	The Sub-Adviser at its expense will"
"5273","make available to the Trustees of the Portfolio and the"

"5275","other appropriate personnel, either in person or, at the"

"5281","investment affairs, including economic, statistical and"

"5292","The Sub-Adviser will use its reasonable efforts to provide,"
"5293","based upon its own expertise, and to arrange with parties"
"5294","independent of the Sub-Adviser such as broker-dealers"

"5297","or Trust's administrator not to be readily available in the"
"5298","ordinary course of business from an automated pricing"
"5299","service.  In addition, the Sub-Adviser will assist the"
"5300","Portfolio and its agents in determining whether prices"
"5301","obtained for valuation purposes accurately reflect market"
"5302","price information relating to the assets of the Portfolio at"
"5303","such times as the Adviser shall reasonably request,"
"5304","including but not limited to, the hours after the close of"

"5313","violations of the federal securities laws (as defined in"

"5316","compliance policies and procedures that pertain to the"
"5317","Portfolio, as well as any change in portfolio manager(s)"
"5318","of the Portfolio."
"5319","             (7)	Unless otherwise directed by"
"5320","the Adviser or the Trust's Board of Trustees, the"
"5321","Sub-Adviser will vote all proxies received in"

"5334","warrants that it has adopted a code of ethics meeting"
"5335","the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act"
"5336","and the requirements of Rule 204A-1 under the"
"5337","Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and has provided"
"5338","the Adviser and the Trustees of the Fund a copy of"
"5339","such code of ethics, together with evidence of its"
"5340","adoption, and will promptly provide copies of any"
"5341","changes thereto, together with evidence of their adoption."
"5342","Upon request of the Adviser, but in any event no less"
"5343","frequently than annually, the Sub-Adviser will supply"
"5344","the Adviser a written report that (A) describes any"

"6272","within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal"
"6273","Revenue Code (the Code), and that the"
"6274","shareholders of the Target Fund will recognize no"
"6275","gain or loss to the extent that they receive shares"
"6276","of the Surviving Fund in exchange for their shares"
"6277","of the Target Fund in accordance with this Plan of"
"6278","Reorganization. In rendering such opinion, Stradley"
"6279","Ronon may request and rely upon representations"
"6280","contained in certificates of officers of the Trust"
"6281","and others, and the officers of the Trust shall use"
"6282","their best efforts to make available such truthful"
"6283","certificates."

"6285","an opinion of Stradley Ronon, dated as of the"
"6286","Effective Time, addressed to and in form and"
"6287","substance satisfactory to the Trust, to the"

"6296","adverse effect on the benefits intended under"
"6297","this Plan of Reorganization for the Funds or"
"6298","their shareholders."
"6299","       7.	This Plan of Reorganization is not"
"6300","conditioned upon the completion of the"
"6301","termination and liquidation of the Technology"

"6450","At its meeting on November 18, 2009, the"

"6493","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"6494","of Old Mutual Funds II:"
"6495","In planning and performing our audits of the"

"6507","Term Fixed Income Fund (constituting Old Mutual"
"6508","Funds II, hereafter referred to as the Funds) as"
"6509","of and for the year ended March 31, 2010, in"
"6510","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"6511","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"6512","considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"6513","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"6514","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"6515","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"6516","on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"6517","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"6518","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"6519","Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"6520","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"6521","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"6522","financial reporting."
"6523","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"6524","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"6525","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"6526","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"6527","management are required to assess the expected"
"6528","benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's"
"6529","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"6530","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"6531","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"6532","of financial statements for external purposes in"
"6533","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"6534","principles.  A company's internal control over financial"
"6535","reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"6536","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"6537","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"6538","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"6539","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"6540","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"6541","preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"6542","with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"6543","that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"6544","being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"6545","of management and trustees of the company; and"
"6546","(3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"6547","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"6548","disposition of a company's assets that could have"
"6549","a material effect on the financial statements."
"6550","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"6551","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"6552","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"6553","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"6554","risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"6555","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"6556","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"6557","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"6558","exists when the design or operation of a control does"
"6559","not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"6560","course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"6561","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"6562","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"6563","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"6564","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"6565","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial"
"6566","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"6567","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"6568","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"6569","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"6570","all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"6571","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"6572","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"6573","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"6574","in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"6575","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities"
"6576","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"6577","above as of March 31, 2010."
