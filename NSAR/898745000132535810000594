"3675","class of shares of a particular series as a series."
"3676","	(a)	The Corporation may issue shares of stock in fractional"

"3706","issue or sale of shares of a particular class, together with all"
"3707","assets in which such consideration is invested or reinvested, all"
"3708","income, earnings, profits and proceeds thereof, including any"
"3709","proceeds derived from the sale, exchange or liquidation of such"
"3710","assets, and any funds or payments derived from any reinvestment of"
"3711","such proceeds in whatever form the same may be, shall irrevocably"
"3712","belong to that class for all purposes, subject only to the rights"
"3713","of creditors, and shall be so recorded upon the books and accounts"
"3714","of the Corporation.  Such consideration, assets, income, earnings,"
"3715","profits and proceeds thereof, including any proceeds derived from"
"3716","the sale, exchange or liquidation of such assets, and any funds or"
"3717","payments derived from any reinvestment of such proceeds, in"
"3718","whatever form the same may be, together with any General Items"
"3719","allocated to that class as provided in the following sentence, are"
"3720","herein referred to as assets belonging to that class.  In the"
"3721","event that there are any assets, income, earnings, profits,"
"3722","proceeds thereof, funds or payments which are not readily"
"3723","identifiable as belonging to any particular class (collectively"
"3724","General Items), such General Items shall be allocated by or"
"3725","under the supervision of the Board of Directors to and among any"
"3726","one or more of the classes established and designated from time to"
"3727","time in such manner and on such basis as the Board of Directors,"
"3728","in its sole discretion, deems fair and equitable, and any General"
"3729","Items so allocated to a particular class shall belong to that"
"3730","class.  Each such allocation by the Board of Directors shall be"
"3731","conclusive and binding for all purposes."
"3732","	(2)	Liabilities Belonging"
"3733","to a Class.  The assets belonging to each particular class shall"
"3734","be charged with the liabilities of the Corporation in respect of"
"3735","that class and all expenses, costs, charges and reserves"
"3736","attributable to that class, and any general liabilities, expenses,"
"3737","costs, charges or reserves of the Corporation which are not"
"3738","readily identifiable as belonging to any particular class shall be"
"3739","allocated and charged by or under the supervision of the Board of"
"3740","Directors to and among any one or more of the classes established"
"3741","and designated from time to time in such manner and on such basis"
"3742","as the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems fair and"
"3743","equitable.  The liabilities, expenses, costs, charges and reserves"
"3744","allocated and so charged to a class are herein referred to as"
"3745","liabilities belonging to that class. Expenses related to the"
"3746","shares of a series may be borne solely by that series (as"
"3747","determined by the Board of Directors).  Each allocation of"
"3748","liabilities, expenses, costs, charges and reserves by the Board of"
"3749","Directors shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes."
"3750","	(3)	Dividends.  The Board"
"3751","of Directors may from time to time declare and pay dividends or"
"3752","distributions, in stock, property or cash, on any or all series of"
"3753","stock or classes of series, the amount of such dividends and"
"3754","property distributions and the payment of them being wholly in the"
"3755","discretion of the Board of Directors.  Dividends may be declared"
"3756","daily or otherwise pursuant to a standing resolution or"
"3757","resolutions adopted only once or with such frequency as the Board"
"3758","of Directors may determine, after providing for actual and accrued"
"3759","liabilities belonging to that class.  All dividends or"
"3760","distributions on shares of a particular class shall be paid only"
"3761","out of surplus or other lawfully available assets determined by"
"3762","the Board of Directors as belonging to such class.  Dividends and"
"3763","distributions may vary between the classes of a series to reflect"
"3764","differing allocations of the expense of each class of that series"
"3765","to such extent and for such purposes as the Boards of Directors"
"3766","may deem appropriate.  The Board of Directors shall have the"
"3767","power, in its sole discretion, to distribute in any fiscal year as"
"3768","dividends, including dividends designated in whole or in part as"
"3769","capital gains distributions, amounts sufficient, in the opinion of"
"3770","the Board of Directors, to enable the Corporation, or where"
"3771","applicable each series of shares or class of a series, to qualify"
"3772","as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code"
"3773","of 1986, as amended, or any successor or comparable statute"
"3774","thereto, and regulations promulgated thereunder, and to avoid"
"3775","liability for the Corporation, or each series of shares or class"
"3776","of a series, for Federal income and excise taxes in respect of"
"3777","that or any other year."
"3778","	(4)	Liquidation.  In the"
"3779","event of the liquidation of the Corporation or of the assets"
"3780","attributable to a particular series or class, the shareholders of"
"3781","each series or class that has been established and designated and"
"3782","is being liquidated shall be entitled to receive, as a series or"
"3783","class, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, the excess"
"3784","of the assets belonging to that series or class over the"
"3785","liabilities belonging to that series or class.  The holders of"
"3786","shares of any series or class shall not be entitled thereby to any"
"3787","distribution upon liquidation of any other series or class.  The"
"3788","assets so distributable to the shareholder of any particular"
"3789","series or class shall be distributed among such shareholders"
"3790","according to their respective rights taking into account the"
"3791","proper allocation of expenses being borne by that series or class."
"3792","The liquidation of assets attributable to any particular series or"
"3793","class in which there are shares then outstanding and the"
"3794","termination of the series or the class may be authorized by vote"
"3795","of a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, without"
"3796","action or approval of the shareholders, to the extent consistent"
"3797","with applicable laws and regulation.  In the event that there are"
"3798","any general assets not belonging to any particular series or class"
"3799","of stock and available for distribution, such distribution shall"
"3800","be made to holders of stock of various series or classes in such"
"3801","proportion as the Board of Directors determines to be fair and"
"3802","equitable, and such determination by the Board of Directors shall"
"3803","be conclusive and binding for all purposes."
"3804","	(5)	Redemption.  All"
"3805","shares of stock of the Corporation shall have the redemption"
"3806","rights provided for in Article V, Section 5."
"3807","	(d)	The Corporation's shares of stock are issued and sold, and"
"3808","all persons who shall acquire stock of the Corporation shall do so,"
"3809","subject to the condition and understanding that the provisions of the"
"3810","Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, as from time to time"
"3811","amended, shall be binding upon them."
"3812","	Section 2.  Quorum Requirements and Voting Rights:  Except as"
"3813","otherwise expressly provided by the Maryland General Corporation Law,"
"3814","the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of one-third of the"
"3815","shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and entitled to"
"3816","vote thereat shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the"
"3817","stockholders, except that where the holders of any series or class are"
"3818","required or permitted to vote as a series or class, one-third of the"
"3819","aggregate number of shares of that series or class outstanding and"
"3820","entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum."
"3821","	Notwithstanding any provision of Maryland General Corporation Law"
"3822","requiring a greater proportion than a majority of the votes of all"
"3823","series or classes or of any series or class of the Corporation's stock"
"3824","entitled to be cast in order to take or authorize any action, any such"
"3825","action may be taken or authorized upon the concurrence of a majority of"
"3826","the aggregate number of votes entitled to be cast thereon subject to the"
"3827","applicable laws and regulations as from time to time in effect or rules"
"3828","or orders of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any successor"
"3829","thereto.  All shares of stock of this Corporation shall have the voting"
"3830","rights provided for in Article V, Section 1, paragraph (b)."
"3831","	Section 3.  No Preemptive Rights:  No holder of shares of capital"
"3832","stock of the Corporation shall, as such holder, have any right to"
"3833","purchase or subscribe for any shares of the capital stock of the"
"3834","Corporation which the Corporation may issue or sell (whether consisting"
"3835","of shares of capital stock authorized by these Articles of"
"3836","Incorporation, or shares of capital stock of the Corporation acquired by"
"3837","it after the issue thereof, or other shares) other than any right which"
"3838","the Board of Directors of the Corporation, in its discretion, may"
"3839","determine."
"3840","	Section 4.  Determination of Net Asset Value: The net asset value of"
"3841","each share of each series or class of each series of the Corporation"
"3842","shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the value of the net assets"
"3843","of the Corporation, or if applicable of the series or class (being the"
"3844","value of the assets of the Corporation or of the particular series or"
"3845","class or attributable to the particular series or class less its actual"
"3846","and accrued liabilities exclusive of capital stock and surplus), by the"
"3847","total number of outstanding shares of the Corporation or the series or"
"3848","class, as applicable.  Such determination may be made on a series-by-"
"3849","series basis or made or adjusted on a class-by-class basis, as"
"3850","appropriate, and shall include any expenses allocated to a specific"
"3851","series or class thereof.  The Board of Directors may adopt procedures"

"4209","liquidation rights of, the shares of each series or class. Subject to"
"4210","the authority of the Board of Directors to increase and decrease the"

"5340","BLACKROCK FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, INC. SUB-ADVISED FUNDS"
"5341","AGREEMENT executed as of the January 1, 2010, by and between PRINCIPAL"
"5342","MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, an Iowa corporation (hereinafter called the
Manager), and BLACKROCK FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, INC., a Delaware"
"5343","Corporation (hereinafter called the Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each Fund of
the Principal  Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the 1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it with
portfolio selection and related research and statistical services in
connection with the investment advisory services for each series
identified in Appendix A ( hereinafter called the Series), which the
Manager has agreed to provide to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to
furnish such services; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies properly
certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly
provide the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated of
any amendment or supplement thereto:

 	(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) with the Fund;

 	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

 	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services
provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the
Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services
described in Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of the
securities and other assets of the Series, subject to the control
and direction of the Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for
the period and on the terms hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor
accepts such appointment and agrees to furnish the services
hereinafter set forth for the compensation herein provided. The
Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an
independent contractor and shall, except as expressly provided or
authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the Fund or
the Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund
or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited
to research, advice and supervision for the Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or
any appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time
to time as economic conditions require, a recommended investment
program for the Fund consistent with the Series' investment
objective and policies.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders for
the purchase and sale of securities without prior consultation
with the Manager and without regard to the length of time the
securities have been held, the resulting rate of portfolio
turnover or any tax considerations, subject always to the
provisions of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws,
the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be
from time to time in effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the
officers, in taking such steps as are reasonably necessary or
appropriate to carry out the decisions of its Board of
Directors, and any appropriate committees of such Board,
regarding the general conduct of the investment business of the
Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services provided to the Series, its compliance with
the 1940 Act and the regulations adopted by the Securities and
Exchange Commission thereunder and the Series' investment
strategies and restrictions as stated in the Fund's prospectus
and statement of additional information, subject to receipt of
such additional information as may be required from the Manager
and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of this Agreement.
The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the maintenance of
Fund records except insofar as is directly related to the
services it provides to the Series.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and
in such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem
appropriate in order to enable it to determine that the
investment policies, procedures and approved investment program
of the Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of the
fair value of certain securities when reliable market quotations
are not readily available for purposes of calculating net asset
value in accordance with procedures and methods established by
the Fund's Board of Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other
personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and
(ii) administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical
personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of
its duties under this Agreement.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission
merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect
all transactions for the Series, place all necessary orders with
broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-dealers),
and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the extent
consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the
Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell
orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event
allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as the
expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the
Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the
most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to
the Fund and to other clients.  The Manager recognizes that, in
some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the position
that may be acquired or sold for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor
will report on such allocations at the request of the Manager,
the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing such
information as the number of aggregated trades to which the
Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades were
directed and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated
trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain
execution of transactions for the Series at prices which are
advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that are
reasonable in relation to the benefits received. However, the
Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis that they
provide brokerage, research or other services or products to the
Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the
Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission
for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount
of commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would
have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor
determines in good faith that such amount of commission is
reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and
research products and/or services provided by such broker or
dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and
research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of
either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have
with respect to the Series as well as to accounts over which
they exercise investment discretion. Not all such services or
products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series.
In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be
utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any
exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all
conditions of such order are complied with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the
Series as are required of an investment advisor of a registered
investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment
Advisor's Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisor's Act), and the
rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such
periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may
reasonably request.  In compliance with the requirements of Rule
31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all
records that it maintains for the Series are the property of the
Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the Fund
and that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the
1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund
any records that it maintains for the Series upon request by the
Fund or the Manager, understanding that the Sub-Advisor must
keep a copy for regulatory purposes.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as
the same may be amended from time to time.  The Manager
acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current Code of
Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to the Manager a
copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of
Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request,
furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio transactions
and reports on investments held by the Series, all in such
detail as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably request.  The
Sub-Advisor will make available its officers and employees to
meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal
place of business on due notice to review the investments of the
Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-
advisor and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to
comply with their respective obligations under applicable laws,
including, without limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment
Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and any rule
or regulation thereunder.  Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-
Advisor's Form ADV more than 48 hours prior to the execution of
this Agreement.

(n)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies solicited
by, or with respect to, the issuers of securities held in the
Series.  The Manager shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor
all proxy solicitation materials that it receives and shall
assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the proxy voting
process.

     3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, as it relates
to the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will not consult with any other
investment advisory firm that provides investment advisory services
to any investment company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance
Company regarding transactions for the Fund in securities or other
assets.

     4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the Fund, the
Manager shall pay the compensation specified in Appendix A to this
Agreement.



     5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, the
Fund or its shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the
Fund resulting from any error of judgment made in the good faith
exercise of the Sub-Advisor's duties under this Agreement or as a
result of the failure by the Manager or any of its affiliates to
comply with the terms of this Agreement except for losses resulting
from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of, or from
reckless disregard of, the duties of the Sub-Advisor or any of its
directors, officers, employees, agents (excluding any broker-dealer
selected by the Sub-Advisor), or affiliates.

     6.	Indemnification

The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sub-Advisor
from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities or damages
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and other related expenses),
(Losses) howsoever arising, from or in connection with this
Agreement or the performance by the Sub-Advisor of its duties
hereunder, so long as the Sub-Advisor shall, after receipt of notice
of any claim or commencement of any action, promptly notify the
Manager in writing of the claim or commencement of such action.  The
Manager shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim or
action effected without its written consent.  Nothing contained
herein shall require the Manager to indemnify the Sub-Advisor for
Losses resulting from the Sub-Advisor's willful misfeasance, bad
faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or from
its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this
Agreement.

     7.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons
affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third parties
to better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations under
this Agreement for the provision of certain personnel and facilities
to the Sub- Advisor, subject to written notification to and approval
of the Manager and, where required by applicable law, the Board of
Directors of the Fund.

     8.	Regulation

The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and administrative
bodies having jurisdiction over the services provided pursuant to
this Agreement any information, reports or other material which any
such body may request or require pursuant to applicable laws and
regulations.

     9.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement

This Agreement shall become effective as of the date of its
execution and, unless otherwise terminated, shall continue in effect
for a period of two years and thereafter from year to year provided
that the continuance is specifically approved at least annually
either by the Board of Directors of the Fund or by a vote of a

either event by a vote of a majority of the Board of Directors of
the Fund who are not interested persons of the Manager, Principal

at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval.

If the shareholders of a Series fail to approve the Agreement or any
continuance of the Agreement in accordance with the requirements of
the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will continue to act as Sub-Advisor
with respect to the Series pending the required approval of the
Agreement or its continuance or of any contract with the Sub-Advisor
or a different manager or Sub-Advisor or other definitive action;
provided, that the compensation received by the Sub-Advisor in
respect to the Series during such period is in compliance with Rule
15a-4 under the 1940 Act.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time without the payment of
any penalty by the Board of Directors of the Fund or by the Sub-

voting securities of the Series on sixty days written notice. This
Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event of its
assignment. In interpreting the provisions of this Section 9, the

"5430","personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and"
"5431","(ii) administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical"
"5432","personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of"
"5433","its duties under this Agreement."
"5434","(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission"
"5435","merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect"
"5436","all transactions for the Series, place all necessary orders"
"5437","with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-"
"5438","dealers), and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the"
"5439","extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders"
"5440","for the Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase"
"5441","or sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such"
"5442","event allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as"
"5443","the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the"
"5444","Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the"
"5445","most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to"
"5446","the Fund and to other clients.  The Manager recognizes that, in"
"5447","some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the position"
"5448","that may be acquired or sold for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor"
"5449","will report on such allocations at the request of the Manager,"
"5450","the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing such"
"5451","information as the number of aggregated trades to which the"
"5452","Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades were"
"5453","directed and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated"
"5454","trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain"
"5455","execution of transactions for the Series at prices which are"
"5456","advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that are"
"5457","reasonable in relation to the benefits received. However, the"
"5458","Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis that"
"5459","they provide brokerage, research or other services or products"
"5460","to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable"
"5461","law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of"
"5462","commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of"
"5463","the amount of commission or dealer spread another broker or"
"5464","dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the"
"5465","Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of"
"5466","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"5467","brokerage and research products and/or services provided by"
"5468","such broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to"
"5469","brokerage and research products and/or services, may be viewed"
"5470","in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"5471","responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have"
"5472","with respect to the Series as well as to accounts over which"
"5473","they exercise investment discretion. Not all such services or"
"5474","products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the"
"5475","Series. In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not"
"5476","be utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under"
"5477","any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that"
"5478","all conditions of such order are complied with."
"5479","(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the"
"5480","Series as are required of an investment advisor of a registered"

"5487","that all records that it maintains for the Series are the"
"5488","property of the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods"
"5489","described by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it"

"5530","is not in compliance with the requirements noted above, the"
"5531","Sub-Advisor, in consultation with the Manager, will take prompt"

Directors, for the period and on the terms hereinafter set forth.
The Sub-Advisor accepts such appointment and agrees to furnish the

to be an independent contractor and shall, except as expressly
provided or authorized, have no authority to act for or represent
the Fund or the Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent
of the Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited
to research, advice and supervision for the Jennison Portfolio.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or
any appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time
to time as economic conditions require, a recommended
investment program for the Fund consistent with the Series'
investment objective and policies.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders for
the purchase and sale of securities without prior consultation
with the Manager and without regard to the length of time the
securities have been held, the resulting rate of portfolio
turnover or any tax considerations, subject always to the
provisions of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws,

amended from time to time.

appropriate to carry out the decisions of its Board of
Directors, and any appropriate committees of such Board,
regarding the general conduct of the investment business of the
Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services provided to the Jennison Portfolio, its

prospectus and statement of additional information, subject to
receipt of such additional information as may be required from
the Manager and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of
this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the
maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is directly
related to the services it provides to the Series. Compliance
with the investment program designed for the Jennison Portfolio
pursuant to Section 2(b) above, shall be deemed compliance with
the investment strategies and restrictions of the Series as
stated in the Fund's prospectus and statement of additional
information.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and
in such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem

of the Jennison Portfolio are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of the
fair value of certain securities when reliable market
quotations are not readily available for purposes of
calculating net asset value in accordance with procedures and
methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other

necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including
affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if
applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law,
purchase or sell orders for the Jennison Portfolio may be
aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of
other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of
securities so sold or purchased, as well as the expenses
incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Sub-Advisor in
the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the most equitable
and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and
to other clients.  The Manager recognizes that, in some cases,
this procedure may limit the size of the position that may be
acquired or sold for the Jennison Portfolio.  The Sub-Advisor
will report on such allocations at the request of the Manager,
the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing such
information as the number of aggregated trades to which the
Jennison Portfolio was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such
trades were directed and the basis for the allocation for the
aggregated trades. The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts
to obtain execution of transactions for the Jennison Portfolio
at prices which are advantageous to the Jennison Portfolio and
at commission rates that are reasonable in relation to the
benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers
or dealers on the basis that they provide brokerage, research
or other services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent
consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a
broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a
securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission or
dealer spread another broker or dealer would have charged for
effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in
good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in
relation to the value of the brokerage and research products
and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This
determination, with respect to brokerage and research products
and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either that
particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which
the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to the
Jennison Portfolio as well as to accounts over which they
exercise investment discretion. Not all such services or
products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the
Jennison Portfolio. In addition, joint repurchase or other
accounts may not be utilized by the Jennison Portfolio except
to the extent permitted under any exemptive order obtained by
the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions of such order are
complied with.  Pursuant to the rules promulgated under Section
326 of the USA PATRIOT ACT, broker-dealers are required to
obtain, verify and record information that identifies each
person who opens an account with them.  In accordance
therewith, Manager acknowledges that broker-dealers whom the
Sub-Advisor selects to execute transactions in the Jennison
Portfolio on the Series' behalf may seek identifying
information about the Manager and/or the Series and the Manager
will provide such information to such broker-dealers, if
requested.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the
Jennison Portfolio as are required of an investment advisor of
a registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and
Investment Advisor's Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisor's"
"5743","Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the
Manager with such periodic and special reports as the Fund or
Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with the
requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor
hereby agrees that all records that it maintains for the
Jennison Portfolio are the property of the Fund, agrees to
preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940
Act any records that it maintains for the Fund and that are
required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and
further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any records
that it maintains for the Jennison Portfolio upon request by
the Fund or the Manager.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as
the same may be amended from time to time.  The Manager
acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current Code of
Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to the Manager a
copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of
Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request,
furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio transactions
and reports on investments held by the Jennison Portfolio, all
in such detail as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably
request.  The Sub-Advisor will make available its officers and
employees to meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the
Fund's principal place of business on due notice to review the
investments of the Jennison Portfolio.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-
advisor and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to
comply with their respective obligations under applicable laws,
including, without limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment
Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and any rule
or regulation thereunder.  Sub-Advisor will advise Manager of
any changes in personnel responsible for managing the Jennison
Portfolio within a reasonable time after any such change.
Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-Advisor's Form ADV more
than 48 hours prior to the execution of this Agreement.

(n)	Perform quarterly and annual tax compliance tests to monitor
the Jennison Portfolio' compliance with Subchapter M of the
Code and Section 817(h) of the Code, subject to receipt of such
additional information as may be required from the Manager and
provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of this Agreement.
The Sub-Advisor shall notify the Manager immediately upon
having a reasonable basis for believing that the Jennison
Portfolio has ceased to be in compliance or that it might not
be in compliance in the future.  If it is determined that the
Jennison Portfolio is not in compliance with the requirements
noted above, the Sub-Advisor, in consultation with the Manager,
will take prompt action to bring the Jennison Portfolio back
into compliance (to the extent possible) within the time
permitted under the Code.

(o)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies solicited
by, or with respect to, the issuers of securities held in the
Jennison Portfolio.  The Manager shall cause to be forwarded to
Sub-Advisor all proxy solicitation materials that it receives
and shall assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the
proxy voting process.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sub-
Advisor shall not be obligated to take any action or render
advice involving legal action on Fund's behalf with respect to
assets in the Jennison Portfolio that become subject to any
legal notices or proceedings, including securities class
actions and bankruptcies.  The Manager retains the right to
proceed directly as a security holder against the issuer of any
security in the Jennison Portfolio.  The Sub-Advisor will also
not be authorized to take custody or possession of any of the
Series' cash or securities in the Jennison Portfolio.

     3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-
Advisor will not consult with any other investment advisory firm
that provides investment advisory services to any investment
company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company regarding
transactions for the Fund in securities or other assets.

     4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the Fund, the
Manager shall pay the compensation specified in Appendix A to this
Agreement.

     5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers  or
employees shall be liable to the Manager, the Fund or its
shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the Fund
resulting from any error of judgment made in the good faith
exercise of the Sub-Advisor's duties under this Agreement or as a
result of the failure by the Manager or any of its affiliates to
comply with the terms of this Agreement except for losses resulting
from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of, or from
reckless disregard of, the duties of the Sub-Advisor or any of its
directors, officers or  employees.

     6.	Indemnification

The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sub-Advisor
from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities or damages
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and other related expenses),
(Losses) howsoever arising, from or in connection with this
Agreement or the performance by the Sub-Advisor of its duties
hereunder, so long as the Sub-Advisor shall, after receipt of
notice of any claim or commencement of any action, promptly notify
the Manager in writing of the claim or commencement of such action.
 The Manager shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim or
action effected without its written consent.  Nothing contained
herein shall require the Manager to indemnify the Sub-Advisor for
Losses resulting from the Sub-Advisor's willful misfeasance, bad
faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or from
its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this
Agreement.

     7.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons
affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third parties
to better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations under
this Agreement for the provision of certain personnel and
facilities to the Sub- Advisor, subject to written notification to
and approval of the Manager and, where required by applicable law,
the Board of Directors of the Fund.

     8.	Regulation

bodies having jurisdiction over the services provided pursuant to
this Agreement any information, reports or other material which any
such body may request or require pursuant to applicable laws and
regulations.

     9.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement

This Agreement shall become effective as of the date of its
execution and, unless otherwise terminated, shall continue in

annually either by the Board of Directors of the Fund or by a vote

Directors of the Fund who are not interested persons of the

Fund cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting

If the shareholders of a Series fail to approve the Agreement or
any continuance of the Agreement in accordance with the
requirements of the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will continue to act
as Sub-Advisor with respect to the Series pending the required
approval of the Agreement or its continuance or of any contract
with the Sub-Advisor or a different manager or Sub-Advisor or other
definitive action; provided, that the compensation received by the

"5851","Directors providing such information as the number of"

"5863","effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of"
"5864","commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have"
"5865","charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor"
"5866","determines in good faith that such amount of commission is"
"5867","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"5868","research products and/or services provided by such broker or"
"5869","dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and"
"5870","research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of"
"5871","either that particular transaction or the overall"
"5872","responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have"
"5873","with respect to the Series as well as to accounts over which"
"5874","they exercise investment discretion. Not all such services or"
"5875","products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the"
"5876","Series. In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not"
"5877","be utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under"
"5878","any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that"
"5879","all conditions of such order are complied with."

"5884","rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with"
"5885","such periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may"

"5888","that all records that it maintains for the Series are the"
"5889","property of the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods"
"5890","described by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it"
"5891","maintains for the Fund and that are required to be maintained"
"5892","by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to"
"5893","surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it maintains"
"5894","for the Series upon request by the Fund or the Manager."
"5895","(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the"
"5896","Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as"
"5897","the same may be amended from time to time.  The Manager"

"6254","orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event"
"6255","allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as the"
"6256","expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the"

"6277","value of the brokerage and research products and/or services"
"6278","provided by such broker or dealer. This determination, with"
"6279","respect to brokerage and research products and/or services, may"
"6280","be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the"
"6281","overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its"
"6282","affiliates have with respect to the Series as well as to"
"6283","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all"

"6290","Series as are required of an investment advisor of a registered"
"6291","investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment"

"6695","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"6696","The Shareholders and Board of Directors"
"6697","Principal Funds, Inc."
"6698","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"6699","Principal Funds, Inc. as of and for the period ended August 31, 2010,"
"6700","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"6701","Oversight Board (United States), we considered its internal controls"
"6702","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"6703","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"6704","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"6705","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"6706","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Principal Funds, Inc.'s"
"6707","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"6708","such opinion."
"6709","The management of Principal Funds, Inc. is responsible for establishing"
"6710","and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"6711","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"6712","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"6713","controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"6714","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"6715","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"6716","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"6717","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"6718","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"6719","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"6720","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"6721","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"6722","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"6723","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that"
"6724","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"6725","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"6726","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"6727","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"6728","company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"6729","statements."
"6730","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"6731","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"6732","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"6733","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"6734","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"6735","procedures may deteriorate."
"6736","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"6737","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"6738","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"6739","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"6740","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"6741","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"6742","misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"6743","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"6744","Our consideration of Principal Funds, Inc.'s internal control over financial"
"6745","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"6746","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that"
"6747","might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"6748","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"6749","deficiencies in Principal Funds, Inc.'s internal control over financial"
"6750","reporting and its operation, including controls for safeguarding securities,"
"6751","that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of August 31,"
"6752","2010."
"6753","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"6754","the Board of Directors of Principal Funds, Inc. and the Securities and"
"6755","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"6756","anyone other than these specified parties."
