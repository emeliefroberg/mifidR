"1456","Floating-Rate Municipal Income Fund"
"1457","(formerly Eaton Vance AMT-Free Limited"

"1461","Floating-Rate Municipal Income Fund"
"1462","(formerly Eaton Vance AMT-Free Limited"

"1466","the year ended March 31, 2014, in"
"1467","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1468","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1469","(United States), we considered the Fund's"
"1470","internal control over financial reporting,"
"1471","including controls over safeguarding"
"1472","securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1473","auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1474","expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1475","statements and to comply with the"
"1476","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"1477","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1478","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"1479","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"1480","express no such opinion."
"1481","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"1482","for establishing and maintaining effective"

"1484","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1485","judgments by management are required to"
"1486","assess the expected benefits and related"

"1491","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1492","statements for external purposes in"

"1511","acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's"
"1512","assets that could have a material effect on"
"1513","the financial statements."

"1519","the risk that controls may become"
"1520","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"1521","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1522","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1523","A deficiency in internal control over"
