"1972","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1973","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1974","LoCorr Investment Trust"
"1975","In planning and performing our audit of the consolidated financial statements of LoCorr Managed Futures Strategy"
"1976","Fund, LoCorr Long/Short Commodities Strategy Fund, LoCorr Market Trend Fund, and LoCorr Multi-Strategy"
"1977","Fund and the financial statements of LoCorr Long/Short Equity Fund and LoCorr Spectrum Income Fund, each a"
"1978","series of LoCorr Investment Trust (the Funds), as of and for the periods ended December 31, 2015, in accordance"
"1979","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"1980","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1981","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1982","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"1983","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1984","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over"
"1985","financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1986","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"1987","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1988","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A"
"1989","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1990","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1991","assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"1992","of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made"
"1993","only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1994","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets"
"1995","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1996","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1997","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1998","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1999","deteriorate."
"2000","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"2001","allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2002","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2003","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds'"
"2004","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2005","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the"
"2006","first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"2007","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"2008","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"2009","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"2010","December 31, 2015."
"2011","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Trustees of the Funds and"
"2012","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"2013","these specified parties."

"2067","       261 School Avenue, 4th Floor"
"2068","       Excelsior, MN 55331"
"2069","Dear Sirs:"

"2084","from time to time in effect, and subject further to such policies and instructions as the Board may from time to time"
"2085","establish.  You will furnish such reports, evaluations, information or analyses to the Trust as the Board of Trustees"
"2086","of the Trust may request from time to time or as you may deem to be desirable.  You also will advise and assist the"
"2087","officers of the Trust in taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate to carry out the decisions of the Board and"

"2089","of the responsibilities, rights or duties described above to one or more persons, provided you notify the Trust and"
"2090","agree that such delegation does not relieve you from any liability hereunder."
"2091","       The Adviser shall provide at least sixty (60) days' prior written notice to the Trust of any change in the"
"2092","ownership or management of the Adviser, or any event or action that may constitute a change in control.  The"
"2093","Adviser shall provide prompt notice of any change in the portfolio manager(s) responsible for the day-to-day"
"2094","management of a Fund."

"2096","       You may delegate any or all of the responsibilities, rights or duties described above to one or more sub-"
"2097","advisers who shall enter into agreements with you, provided the agreements are approved and ratified (i) by the"
"2098","Board including a majority of the trustees who are not interested persons of you or of the Trust, cast in person at a"
"2099","meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval, and (ii) if required under interpretations of the Investment"
"2100","Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Act), by the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff, by vote of"
"2101","the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the applicable Fund (unless the Trust has obtained an"
"2102","exemption from the provisions of Section 15(a) of the Act).  Any such delegation shall not relieve you from any"
"2103","liability hereunder."
"2104","3.	ALLOCATION OF CHARGES AND EXPENSES"
"2105","       You will pay the compensation of any sub-adviser retained pursuant to paragraph 2 above and the"
"2106","compensation and expenses of any persons rendering any services to the Trust who are directors, officers,"
"2107","employees, members or stockholders of your corporation or limited liability company and will make available,"
"2108","without expense to the Fund, the services of such of your employees as may duly be elected trustees or officers of"
"2109","the Trust, subject to their individual consent to serve and to any limitations imposed by law.  The compensation and"
"2110","expenses of any trustees, officers and employees of the Trust who are not directors, officers, employees, members of"
"2111","your limited liability company will be paid by the respective Fund.  You will pay all advertising, promotion and"
"2112","other distribution expenses incurred in connection with the Fund's shares to the extent such expenses are not"
"2113","permitted to be paid by the Fund under any distribution expense plan or any other permissible arrangement that may"
"2114","be adopted in the future."
"2115","       Each Fund will be responsible for the payment of all operating expenses of the respective Fund, including"
"2116","the compensation and expenses of any employees of the Trust and of any other persons rendering any services to the"
"2117","Fund; clerical and shareholder service staff salaries; office space and other office expenses; fees and expenses"
"2118","incurred by the Fund in connection with membership in investment company organizations; legal, auditing and"
"2119","accounting expenses; expenses of registering shares under federal and state securities laws, including expenses"

"2126","documents, statements or reports to shareholders; expenses of shareholders' meetings and proxy solicitations;"
"2127","advertising, promotion and other expenses incurred directly or indirectly in connection with the sale or distribution"
"2128","of the Fund's shares that the Fund is authorized to pay pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Act; and all other operating"
"2129","expenses not specifically assumed by you.  Each Fund will also pay all brokerage fees and commissions, taxes,"
"2130","borrowing costs (such as (a) interest and (b) dividend expenses on securities sold short), fees and expenses of the"
"2131","non-interested person Trustees and such extraordinary or non-recurring expenses as may arise, including litigation to"
"2132","which the Fund may be a party and indemnification of the Trust's Trustees and officers with respect thereto."
"2133","       You may obtain reimbursement from the respective Fund, at such time or times as you may determine in"
"2134","your sole discretion, for any of the expenses advanced by you, which the Fund is obligated to pay, and such"
"2135","reimbursement shall not be considered to be part of your compensation pursuant to this Agreement."
"2136","4.	COMPENSATION OF THE MANAGER"
"2137","       For all of the services to be rendered as provided in this Agreement, as of the last business day of each"
"2138","month, each Fund will pay you a fee based on the average value of the daily net assets of the respective Fund and"
"2139","paid at an annual rate as specified in Appendix A attached hereto."
"2140","       The average value of the daily net assets of each Fund shall be determined pursuant to the applicable"
"2141","provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust or a resolution of the Board of Trustees, if required.  If,"
"2142","pursuant to such provisions, the determination of net asset value of a Fund is suspended for any particular business"
"2143","day, then for the purposes of this paragraph, the value of the net assets of the Fund as last determined shall be"
"2144","deemed to be the value of the net assets as of the close of the business day, or as of such other time as the value of"
"2145","the Fund's net assets may lawfully be determined, on that day.  If the determination of the net asset value of a Fund"
"2146","has been suspended for a period including such month, your compensation payable at the end of such month shall be"
"2147","computed on the basis of the value of the net assets of the Fund as last determined (whether during or prior to such"
"2148","month)."
"2149","5.	EXECUTION OF PURCHASE AND SALE ORDERS"
"2150","       In connection with purchases or sales of portfolio securities for the account of a Fund, it is understood that"
"2151","you (or the applicable sub-adviser retained pursuant to paragraph 2 above) will arrange for the placing of all orders"
"2152","for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the account with brokers or dealers selected by you (or the sub-"
"2153","adviser), subject to review of this selection by the Board of Trustees from time to time.  You (or the sub-adviser)"
"2154","will be responsible for the negotiation and the allocation of principal business and portfolio brokerage.  In the"
"2155","selection of such brokers or dealers and the placing of such orders, you (or the sub-adviser) are directed at all times"
"2156","to seek for the Funds the best qualitative execution, taking into account such factors as price (including the"
"2157","applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), the execution capability, financial responsibility and"
"2158","responsiveness of the broker or dealer and the brokerage and research services provided by the broker or dealer."
"2159","       You (or the sub-adviser) should generally seek favorable prices and commission rates that are reasonable in"
"2160","relation to the benefits received.  In seeking best qualitative execution, you (or the sub-adviser) are authorized to"
"2161","select brokers or dealers who also provide brokerage and research services to the Fund and/or the other accounts"
"2162","over which you exercise investment discretion.  You (or the sub-adviser) are authorized to pay a broker or dealer"
"2163","who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a Fund portfolio transaction, which"
"2164","commission is in excess of the amount of the commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting"
"2165","that transaction, if you (or the sub-adviser) determine in good faith that the amount of the commission is reasonable"
"2166","in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the executing broker or dealer.  The"
"2167","determination may be viewed in terms of either a particular transaction or your (or the sub-adviser's) overall"
"2168","responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to accounts over which you (or the sub-adviser) exercise investment"
"2169","discretion.  The Funds and you (and the sub-adviser) understand and acknowledge that, although the information"
"2170","may be useful to a Fund and you (and the sub-adviser), it is not possible to place a dollar value on such information."
"2171","The Board of Trustees shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Fund to determine if the commissions"
"2172","paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the respective Fund."
"2173","       A broker's or dealer's sale or promotion of Fund shares shall not be a factor considered by your personnel"
"2174","responsible for selecting brokers to effect securities transactions on behalf of the Funds.  You and your personnel"
"2175","shall not enter into any written or oral agreement or arrangement to compensate a broker or dealer for any promotion"
"2176","or sale of Fund shares by directing to such broker or dealer (i) the Fund's portfolio securities transactions or (ii) any"
"2177","remuneration, including but not limited to, any commission, mark-up, mark down or other fee received or to be"
"2178","received from the Fund's portfolio transactions through such broker or dealer.  However, you may place Fund"
"2179","portfolio transactions with brokers or dealers that sell or promote shares of the Fund provided the Board of Trustees"
"2180","has adopted policies and procedures under Rule 12b-1(h) under the Act and such transactions are conducted in"
"2181","compliance with those policies and procedures."
"2182","       Subject to the provisions of the Act, and other applicable law, you (or the sub-adviser), any of your (and the"
"2183","sub-adviser's) affiliates or any affiliates of your (or the sub-adviser's) affiliates may retain compensation in"
"2184","connection with effecting the Fund's portfolio transactions, including transactions effected through others.  If any"
"2185","occasion should arise in which you (or the sub-adviser) give any advice to your clients (or clients of the sub-adviser)"
"2186","concerning the shares of a Fund, you (or the sub-adviser) will act solely as investment counsel for such client and"
"2187","not in any way on behalf of the Fund."
"2188","6.	PROXY VOTING"
"2189","       You will vote, or cause your designee to vote, all proxies solicited by or with respect to the issuers of"
"2190","securities in which assets of the Funds may be invested from time to time.  Such proxies will be voted in a manner"
"2191","that you deem, in good faith, to be in the best interest of the respective Fund and in accordance with your proxy"
"2192","voting policy.  You agree to provide a copy of your proxy voting policy, and any amendments thereto, to the Trust"
"2193","prior to the execution of this Agreement."
"2194","7.	CODE OF ETHICS"
"2195","       You have adopted a written code of ethics complying with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the Act"
"2196","and will provide the Trust with a copy of the code and evidence of its adoption.  Within 45 days of the last calendar"
"2197","quarter of each year while this Agreement is in effect, you will provide to the Board of Trustees of the Trust a"
"2198","written report that describes any issues arising under the code of ethics since the last report to the Board of Trustees,"
"2199","including, but not limited to, information about material violations of the code and sanctions imposed in response to"
"2200","the material violations; and which certifies that you have adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent access"
"2201","persons (as that term is defined in Rule 17j-1) from violating the code."
"2202","8.	SERVICES NOT EXCLUSIVE/USE OF NAME"
"2203","       Your (and a sub-adviser's) services to the Fund(s) pursuant to this Agreement are not to be deemed to be"
"2204","exclusive, and it is understood that you (or a sub-adviser) may render investment advice, management and other"
"2205","services to others, including other registered investment companies, provided, however, that such other services and"
"2206","activities do not, during the term of this Agreement, interfere in a material manner, with your ability to meet all of"
"2207","your obligations with respect to rendering services to the Funds."
"2208","       The Trust and you acknowledge that all rights to the name LoCorr or any variation thereof belong to you,"
"2209","and that the Trust is being granted a limited license to use such words in any Fund name or in any class name.  In the"
"2210","event you cease to be the adviser to a Fund, the Trust's right to the use of the name LoCorr with respective to such"
"2211","Fund shall automatically cease on the 90th day following the termination of this Agreement.  The right to the name"
"2212","may also be withdrawn by you during the term of this Agreement upon ninety (90) days' written notice by you to the"
"2213","Trust.  Nothing contained herein shall impair or diminish in any respect, your right to use the name LoCorr in the"
"2214","name of or in connection with any other business enterprises with which you are or may become associated.  There"
"2215","is no charge to the Trust for the right to use this name."
"2216","9.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF MANAGER"
"2217","       You may rely on information reasonably believed by you to be accurate and reliable.  Except as may"
"2218","otherwise be required by the Act or the rules thereunder, neither you nor your directors, officers, employees,"
"2219","shareholders, members, agents, control persons or affiliates of any thereof shall be subject to any liability for, or any"
"2220","damages, expenses or losses incurred by the Trust in connection with, any error of judgment, mistake of law, any act"
"2221","or omission connected with or arising out of any services rendered under, or payments made pursuant to, this"
"2222","Agreement or any other matter to which this Agreement relates, except by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or"
"2223","gross negligence on the part of any such persons in the performance of your duties under this Agreement, or by"
"2224","reason of reckless disregard by any of such persons of your obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"2225","       Any person, even though also a director, officer, employee, shareholder, member or agent of you, who may"
"2226","be or become a trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Trust, shall be deemed, when rendering services to the"
"2227","Trust or acting on any business of the Trust (other than services or business in connection with your duties"
"2228","hereunder), to be rendering such services to or acting solely for the Trust and not as a director, officer, employee,"
"2229","shareholder, member, or agent of you, or one under your control or direction, even though paid by you."
"2230","10.	DURATION AND TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT"
"2231","       The term of this Agreement shall begin with respect to each Fund upon the commencement of the"
"2232","respective Fund's operations and shall continue in effect with respect to the Fund for a period of two years.  This"
"2233","Agreement shall continue in effect with respect to each Fund from year to year thereafter, subject to termination as"
"2234","hereinafter provided, if such continuance is approved at least annually by (a) a majority of the outstanding voting"
"2235","securities of the Fund or by vote of the Trust's Board of Trustees, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose"
"2236","of voting on such approval, and (b) by vote of a majority of the Trustees of the Trust who are not parties to this"
"2237","Agreement or interested persons of any party to this Agreement, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose"
"2238","of voting on such approval."
"2239","       This Agreement may, on sixty (60) days' written notice, be terminated with respect to a Fund, at any time"
"2240","without the payment of any penalty, by the Board of Trustees, by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting"
"2241","securities of the Fund, or by you.  This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event of its assignment"
"2242","11	AMENDMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT"
"2243","       No provision of this Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, and no"
"2244","amendment of this Agreement shall be effective until approved by the Board of Trustees, including a majority of the"
"2245","Trustees who are not interested persons of you or of the Trust, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of"
"2246","voting on such approval, and (if required under interpretations of the Act by the Securities and Exchange"
"2247","Commission or its staff) by vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund to"
"2248","which the amendment relates."
"2249","12.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY TO TRUST PROPERTY"
"2250","       The term LoCorr Investment Trust means and refers to the Trustees from time to time serving under the"
"2251","Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust as the same may subsequently thereto have been, or subsequently hereto"
"2252","be, amended.  It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Trust hereunder shall not be binding upon any of"
"2253","Trustees, officers, employees, agents or nominees of the Trust, or any shareholders of any series of the Trust,"
"2254","personally, but bind only the trust property of the Trust (and only the property of the applicable Fund), as provided"
"2255","in the Agreement and Declaration of Trust.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement have been authorized by"
"2256","the Trustees and shareholders of the applicable Fund and signed by officers of the Trust, acting as such, and neither"
"2257","such authorization by such Trustees and shareholders nor such execution and delivery by such officers shall be"
"2258","deemed to have been made by any of them individually or to impose any liability on any of them personally, but"
"2259","shall bind only the trust property of the Trust (and only the property of applicable Fund) as provided in its"
"2260","Agreement and Declaration of Trust.  A copy of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust is on file with the Secretary"
"2261","of State of Ohio."
"2262","13.	SEVERABILITY"

"2386","Management, LLC (the Adviser), and Graham Capital Management, L.P (the Sub-Adviser)."
"2387","      WHEREAS, the Adviser acts as an investment adviser to LoCorr Managed Futures"

"2389","Trust, an Ohio business trust (the Trust), pursuant to an Management Agreement dated as of"
"2390","____________________, 20__ (the Management Agreement);"
"2391","      WHEREAS, the Trust is an open-end management investment company registered under"
"2392","the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act); and"
"2393","      WHEREAS, the Adviser desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to render investment advisory"
"2394","services to the Fund, and the Sub-Adviser is willing to render such services."
"2395","      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual agreements"
"2396","hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:"
"2397","      Section 1.	Appointment and Status of Sub-Adviser. The Adviser hereby appoints"
"2398","the Sub-Adviser to provide investment advisory services to the Fund for the period and on the"
"2399","terms set forth in this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser accepts such appointment and agrees to render"
"2400","the services herein set forth, for the compensation herein provided. The Sub-Adviser shall for all"
"2401","purposes herein be deemed to be an independent contractor of the Adviser and the Trust and shall,"

"2408","by the Adviser (the Sub-Advised Assets) as well as the notional trading size of the Sub-Adviser"
"2409","Assets , including the purchase, retention and disposition thereof and the execution of agreements"
"2410","relating thereto, in accordance with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and restrictions as"
"2411","stated in the Fund's most recent Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information that have"
"2412","been provided to Sub-Adviser by Adviser (together, the Prospectus) and subject to the following"
"2413","understandings:"
"2414","      (a)	The Sub-Adviser shall furnish a continuous investment program for the Sub-"
"2415","Advised Assets and determine from time to time, with respect to the Sub-Advised Assets, what"
"2416","investments or securities will be purchased, retained or sold by the Fund and what portion of the"
"2417","Sub-Advised Assets will be invested or held uninvested as cash;"
"2418","      (b)	The Sub-Adviser shall use its best judgment in the performance of its duties under"
"2419","this Agreement;"
"2420","      (c)	The Sub-Adviser, in the performance of its duties and obligations under this"
"2421","Agreement for the Fund, shall act in conformity with the most recent version of the Trust's"
"2422","Declaration of Trust, its By-Laws and the Fund's Prospectus that have been provided to it by the"
"2423","Adviser and with the reasonable instructions and directions of the Trust's Board of Trustees and"
"2424","the Adviser, and will conform to and comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act and all other"
"2425","applicable federal and state laws and regulations;"
"2426","      (d)	The Sub-Adviser shall place portfolio transactions pursuant to its determinations"
"2427","either directly with the issuer or with any broker and/or dealer in such securities or financial"
"2428","instruments, subject to Section 3 below;"
"2429","      (e)	The Sub-Adviser shall maintain books and records with respect to the transactions"
"2430","in securities and other financial instruments of the Sub-Advised Assets and shall render to the"
"2431","Adviser and the Trust's Board of Trustees such periodic and special reports as the Adviser or the"
"2432","Board may reasonably request;"
"2433","      (f)	The Sub-Adviser shall provide the Trust's custodian and fund accountant on each"
"2434","business day with information about Fund transactions in securities and other financial"
"2435","instruments for which it is responsible, and with such other information relating to the Trust as"
"2436","may be required under the terms of the then-current custody agreement between the Trust and"
"2437","the custodian;"
"2438","      (g)	With respect to the Sub-Advised Assets, the Sub-Adviser shall respond as quickly"
"2439","as reasonably possible to any request from the Adviser or the Fund's fund accountant for"
"2440","assistance in obtaining price sources for securities or other financial instruments held by the"
"2441","Fund or determining a price when a price source is not available, and shall periodically review"
"2442","the prices used by the fund accountant to determine net asset value and advise the fund"
"2443","accountant promptly if any price appears to be incorrect;"
"2444","      (h)	With respect to the Sub-Advised Assets, the Sub-Adviser shall vote all proxies"
"2445","solicited by or with respect to the issuers of securities in which assets of the Fund may be"
"2446","invested from time to time.  Such proxies will be voted in a manner that the Sub-Adviser deems,"
"2447","in good faith, to be in the best interests of the Fund and in accordance with the Sub-Adviser's"
"2448","proxy voting policy.  The Sub-Adviser shall provided a copy of its proxy voting policy, and any"
"2449","amendments thereto, to the Adviser prior to the execution of this Agreement;"
"2450","      (i)	The Sub-Adviser hereby represents that it has adopted a written code of ethics"
"2451","complying with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and will provide the Adviser"
"2452","and the Trust with a copy of the code and evidence of its adoption.  Within 45 days of the last"
"2453","calendar quarter of each year while this Agreement is in effect, the Sub-Adviser shall provide to"
"2454","the Board a written report that describes any issues arising under the code of ethics since the last"
"2455","report to the Board, including, but not limited to, information about material violations of the"
"2456","code and sanctions imposed in response to the material violations; and which certifies that the"
"2457","Sub-Adviser has adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent access persons (as that"
"2458","term is defined in Rule 17j-1) from violating the code;"
"2459","      (j)	The Sub-Adviser agrees to maintain adequate compliance procedures to ensure its"
"2460","compliance with the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and other"
"2461","applicable federal and state regulations with respect to its trading for the Fund.  The Sub-Adviser"
"2462","shall provide to the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer the executive summary of its annual"
"2463","written report regarding the Sub-Adviser's compliance program."
"2464","      (k)	Unless and until the Sub-Adviser is otherwise informed in writing, it is intended"
"2465","that all Fund assets without exception serve as segregated assets for the Sub-Adviser's"
"2466","compliance, with respect to its own trading, with the 1940 Act's applicable rules of asset"
"2467","segregation.  The Adviser shall therefore cause all assets of the Fund not allocated to the Sub-"
"2468","Adviser for its own trading to be held in an account marked as a segregated account."
"2469","      (l)	Some of the trading of the Sub-Adviser's investment program may be done in the"
"2470","Fund's wholly owned subsidiary, LCMFS Fund Limited, as determined by the Adviser with the"
"2471","Sub-Adviser's consent."
"2472","      (m)	The Sub-Adviser shall promptly notify the Adviser of any circumstance that could"
"2473","reasonably be deemed to materially affect its ability to perform its obligations and services as"
"2474","described in the Sub-Advisory Agreement or that could have a negative impact on the Fund and"
"2475","the Adviser.  Such circumstances, could include, but are not limited to, items such as:"
"2476","a.	any potential legal or regulatory actions or litigation pertaining to the Sub-"
"2477","Adviser or any of its key employees and the disclosure of the results of those"
"2478","actions;"
"2479","b.	any material operational disruptions caused by the loss of functionality for"
"2480","key personnel or systems;"
"2481","c.	Any circumstance that would cause the Fund to revise its offering"
"2482","documents or marketing material."
"2483","      Section 3.	Execution of Purchase and Sale Orders. In connection with purchases"
"2484","or sales of portfolio securities or other financial instruments for the account of the Fund, the Sub-"
"2485","Adviser will arrange for the placing of all orders for their purchase and sale for the account with"
"2486","brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser's selection of brokers and dealers"
"2487","will be reviewed by the Board from time to time. The Sub-Adviser will be responsible for the"
"2488","negotiation and the allocation of principal business and portfolio brokerage. In the selection of"
"2489","such brokers or dealers and the placing of such orders, the Sub-Adviser will at all times seek for"
"2490","the Fund the best execution, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable"
"2491","brokerage commission or dealer spread), the execution capability, financial responsibility and"
"2492","responsiveness of the broker or dealer and the brokerage and research services provided by the"
"2493","broker or dealer."
"2494","            The Sub-Adviser should generally seek favorable prices and commission rates"
"2495","that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. In seeking best execution, the Sub-"
"2496","Adviser is authorized to select brokers or dealers who also provide brokerage and research"
"2497","services to the Fund and/or the other accounts over which it exercises investment discretion. The"
"2498","Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research"
"2499","services a commission for executing a Fund portfolio transaction that is in excess of the amount"
"2500","of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the"
"2501","Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that the amount of the commission is reasonable in relation"
"2502","to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the executing broker or dealer."
"2503","The determination may be viewed in terms of either a particular transaction or the Sub-Adviser's"
"2504","overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to accounts over which the Sub-Adviser"
"2505","exercises investment discretion. The Trust and the Sub-Adviser understand and acknowledge"
"2506","that, although the information may be useful to the Fund and the Sub-Adviser, it is not possible"
"2507","to place a dollar value on such information. The Board shall periodically review the commissions"
"2508","paid by the Fund to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were"
"2509","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Fund.  The Sub-Adviser may not give consideration"
"2510","to sales of shares of the Fund as a factor in the selection of brokers and dealers to execute Fund"
"2511","portfolio transactions."
"2512","            Subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act, and other applicable law, the Sub-"
"2513","Adviser, any of its affiliates or any affiliates of its affiliates may retain compensation in"
"2514","connection with effecting the Fund's portfolio transactions, including transactions effected"
"2515","through others.  If any occasion should arise in which the Sub-Adviser gives any advice to"
"2516","clients of the Sub-Adviser concerning the shares of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will act solely as"
"2517","investment counsel for such client and not in any way on behalf of the Fund."
"2518","      Section 4.	Services to Other Companies or Accounts.  The Sub-Adviser's services"
"2519","to the Fund pursuant to this Agreement are not to be deemed to be exclusive and it is understood"
"2520","that the Sub-Adviser may render investment advice, management and other services to others,"
"2521","including other registered investment companies.  The Adviser understands that the persons"
"2522","employed by the Sub-Adviser to assist in the performance of the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder"
"2523","will not devote their full time to such service and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit"
"2524","or restrict the right of the Sub-Adviser or any affiliate of the Sub-Advisor to engage in and devote"
"2525","time and attention to other business or to render services of whatever kind or nature. The Sub-"
"2526","Adviser agrees to maintain a minimum of $[_________] in capacity for the Fund through"
"2527","[_____________].  During the term of the Agreement and for one year thereafter, each party"
"2528","agrees not to engage or employ the other party's employees who have been employed at any time"
"2529","during the term of the Agreement."
"2530","      Section 5.	Books and Records. The Sub-Adviser shall keep the books and records"
"2531","required to be maintained by it pursuant to Section 2(e) of this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser"
"2532","agrees that all records that it maintains for the Trust are the property of the Trust and it will"
"2533","promptly surrender any of such records to the Trust upon the Trust's request. The Sub-Adviser"
"2534","further agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any such"
"2535","records as are required to be maintained by the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Trust by Rule 31a-"
"2536","1 under the 1940 Act."
"2537","      Section 6.	Expenses of the Sub-Adviser. During the term of this Agreement, the"
"2538","Sub-Adviser will pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities under this"
"2539","Agreement other than the cost of securities and investments purchased for the Fund (including"
"2540","taxes and brokerage commissions, if any).  All other expenses to be incurred in the operation of the"
"2541","Fund will be borne by the Fund, except to the extent specifically assumed by the Sub-Adviser, the"
"2542","Adviser or a third party.  The Sub-Adviser may provide financial support for various activities"
"2543","upon mutual consent of all parties."
"2544","      Section 7.	Compensation of the Sub-Adviser. For the services provided and the"
"2545","expenses borne pursuant to this Agreement, the Adviser will pay to the Sub-Adviser as full"
"2546","compensation the fees as specified in Appendix A attached hereto.  The Adviser agrees to provide"
"2547","sufficient information to the Sub-Adviser to support the Adviser's determination of the amount"
"2548","payable.  This fee for each month will be paid to the Sub-Adviser during the succeeding month."
"2549","The Adviser is solely responsible for the payment of the Sub-Adviser's fees, and the Sub-Adviser"
"2550","agrees not to seek payment of its fees from the Trust."
"2551","      Section 8.	Use of Names. The Trust, Adviser and Sub-Adviser acknowledge that all"
"2552","rights to the name LoCorr belong to the Adviser and all rights to the name [____________]"
"2553","belong to the Sub-Adviser. In the event the Adviser ceases to be the adviser or the Sub-Adviser"
"2554","ceases to be the Sub-Adviser, the Trust's right to the use of the name LoCorr or"
"2555","[___________], respectively, shall automatically cease on the 90th day following the"
"2556","termination of this Agreement. The right to the name may also be withdrawn by the Adviser or"
"2557","Sub-Adviser during the term of the Management Agreement upon 90 days' written notice,"
"2558","respectively, by the Adviser or by the Sub-Adviser to the Trust. Nothing contained herein shall"
"2559","impair or diminish in any respect the Adviser's right to use the name LoCorr or the Sub-"
"2560","Adviser's right to use the name [____________] in the name of, or in connection with, any other"
"2561","business enterprises with which, respectively, the Adviser or Sub-Adviser or may become"
"2562","associated. There is no charge to the Trust for the right to use either of these names."
"2563","            The Adviser agrees to submit copies of all proposed prospectuses, proxy statements,"
"2564","reports to shareholders, sales literature, or other material prepared for distribution to interest"
"2565","holders of the Fund or the public that refer in any way to the Sub-Adviser (other than identifying"
"2566","the Sub-Adviser as Sub-Adviser to the Fund) to the Sub-Adviser at its principal office for review"
"2567","prior to use, and the Sub-Adviser agrees to review such materials by a reasonable and appropriate"
"2568","deadline. Neither the Adviser, nor the Fund nor any affiliate of the foregoing will use the"
"2569","registered trademarks, service marks, logos, names or any other proprietary designations of Sub-"
"2570","Adviser, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates (collectively, Sub-Adviser Marks) in any advertising or"
"2571","promotional materials without Sub-Adviser's prior written approval, which will not be"
"2572","unreasonably withheld. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the Adviser will continue to"
"2573","furnish to the Sub-Adviser copies of any of the above-mentioned materials that refer in any way to"
"2574","the Sub-Adviser. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement."
"2575","      Section 9.	Liability. Neither the Sub-Adviser nor its shareholders, members, officers,"
"2576","directors, employees, agents, control persons or affiliates of any thereof, shall be liable for any"
"2577","error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Fund in connection with the"
"2578","matters to which this Agreement relates except a loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty"
"2579","with respect to the receipt of compensation for services (in which case any award of damages shall"
"2580","be limited to the period and the amount set forth in Section 36(b)(3) of the 1940 Act) or a loss"
"2581","resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the performance of"
"2582","its duties or from reckless disregard by it of its obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"2583","            Any person, even though also a director, officer, employee, shareholder, member or"
"2584","agent of the Sub-Adviser, who may be or become an officer, director, trustee, employee or agent of"
"2585","the Trust, shall be deemed, when rendering services to the Trust or acting on any business of the"
"2586","Trust (other than services or business in connection with the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder), to be"
"2587","rendering such services to or acting solely for the Trust and not as a director, officer, employee,"
"2588","shareholder, member or agent of the Sub-Adviser, or one under the Sub-Adviser's control or"
"2589","direction, even though paid by the Sub-Adviser."
"2590","      Section 10.	Duration and Termination. The term of this Agreement shall begin on"

"2669","by law.  In addition, Sub-Adviser, and Sub-Adviser's officers, directors and employees are"
"2670","prohibited from receiving compensation or other consideration, for themselves or on behalf of the"
"2671","Fund, as a result of disclosing the Fund's portfolio holdings.  Sub-Adviser agrees that, consistent"
"2672","with its Code of Ethics, neither it nor its officers, directors or employees may engage in personal"
"2673","securities transactions based on nonpublic information about the Fund's portfolio holdings."
"2674","            The Adviser, on its own behalf or on behalf of the Fund, shall not disclose"
"2675","information of a confidential nature acquired in consequence of this Agreement, except for"
"2676","information that it may be entitled or bound to disclose by law, regulation or that is disclosed to"
"2677","its advisors where reasonably necessary for the performance of its professional services. Except"
"2678","to the extent necessary to conduct the Fund's business or as required by law, the Adviser shall"
"2679","not and, on behalf of its own behalf and or behalf of the Fund, shall neither disclose nor use"
"2680","information of a confidential nature, whether written or oral, contained in computer files or"
"2681","software, or otherwise (including without limitation trading instructions made by the Sub-"
"2682","Adviser and trading positions), relating to or concerning the Sub-Adviser's investment program."
"2683","Adviser shall not and shall cause the Fund not to reverse engineer or attempt to reverse engineer"
"2684","the investment program and the Adviser acknowledges and agrees on behalf of both itself and"
"2685","the Fund that any attempt on its part to do so warrants the Sub-Adviser's recourse to immediate"
"2686","equitable relief."
"2687","            Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that any"
"2688","market counterparty with whom the Sub-Adviser deals requires information relating to the Fund"
"2689","(including, but not limited to, the identity of the Adviser or the Fund and market value of the"
"2690","Fund), the Sub-Adviser shall be permitted to disclose such information to the extent necessary to"
"2691","effect transactions on behalf of the Fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement."
"2692","      Section 22.	Registration as a Commodity Pool."
"2693","         	The Adviser will register as a commodity pool operator, and cause the Fund to"
"2694","meet the qualifications of a commodity pool, under the regulations of the Commodity Futures"
"2695","Trading Commission and will continue such registration and qualification for the duration of this"
"2696","Agreement.  The Adviser agrees on behalf of itself and the Fund that the Fund shall qualify as a"
"2697","qualified eligible person under Rule 4.7 of the regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act"
"2698","and that the Fund agrees to be so treated as an exempt account."

"2738","SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT"
"2739","      SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT, dated as of __________, 2016, between LoCorr Fund"
"2740","Management, LLC (the Adviser), and Millburn Ridgefield Corporation (the Sub-Adviser)."
"2741","      WHEREAS, the Adviser acts as an investment adviser to LoCorr Managed Futures"
"2742","Strategy Fund (the Fund), a series of shares of beneficial interest of the LoCorr Investment"
"2743","Trust, an Ohio business trust (the Trust), pursuant to an Management Agreement dated as of"
"2744","____________________, 20__ (the Management Agreement);"
"2745","      WHEREAS, the Trust is an open-end management investment company registered under"
"2746","the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act); and"
"2747","      WHEREAS, the Adviser desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to render investment advisory"
"2748","services to the Fund, and the Sub-Adviser is willing to render such services."
"2749","      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual agreements"
"2750","hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:"
"2751","      Section 1.	Appointment and Status of Sub-Adviser. The Adviser hereby appoints"
"2752","the Sub-Adviser to provide investment advisory services to the Fund for the period and on the"
"2753","terms set forth in this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser accepts such appointment and agrees to render"
"2754","the services herein set forth, for the compensation herein provided. The Sub-Adviser shall for all"
"2755","purposes herein be deemed to be an independent contractor of the Adviser and the Trust and shall,"
"2756","unless otherwise expressly provided herein or authorized by the Adviser or the Board of Trustees"
"2757","of the Trust from time to time, have no authority to act for or represent the Adviser or the Trust in"
"2758","any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Adviser or the Trust."
"2759","      Section 2.	Sub-Adviser's Duties.  Subject to the general supervision of the Trust's"
"2760","Board of Trustees (the Board) and the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser shall, employing its discretion,"

"2762","by the Adviser (the Sub-Advised Assets) as well as the notional trading size of the Sub-Adviser"
"2763","Assets , including the purchase, retention and disposition thereof and the execution of agreements"
"2764","relating thereto, in accordance with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and restrictions as"
"2765","stated in the Fund's most recent Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information that have"
"2766","been provided to Sub-Adviser by Adviser (together, the Prospectus) and subject to the following"
"2767","understandings:"
"2768","      (a)	The Sub-Adviser shall furnish a continuous investment program for the Sub-"
"2769","Advised Assets and determine from time to time, with respect to the Sub-Advised Assets, what"
"2770","investments or securities will be purchased, retained or sold by the Fund and what portion of the"
"2771","Sub-Advised Assets will be invested or held uninvested as cash;"
"2772","      (b)	The Sub-Adviser shall use its best judgment in the performance of its duties under"
"2773","this Agreement;"
"2774","      (c)	The Sub-Adviser, in the performance of its duties and obligations under this"
"2775","Agreement for the Fund, shall act in conformity with the most recent version of the Trust's"
"2776","Declaration of Trust, its By-Laws and the Fund's Prospectus that have been provided to it by the"
"2777","Adviser and with the reasonable instructions and directions of the Trust's Board of Trustees and"
"2778","the Adviser, and will conform to and comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act and all other"
"2779","applicable federal and state laws and regulations;"
"2780","      (d)	The Sub-Adviser shall place portfolio transactions pursuant to its determinations"
"2781","either directly with the issuer or with any broker and/or dealer in such securities or financial"
"2782","instruments, subject to Section 3 below;"
"2783","      (e)	The Sub-Adviser shall maintain books and records with respect to the transactions"
"2784","in securities and other financial instruments of the Sub-Advised Assets and shall render to the"
"2785","Adviser and the Trust's Board of Trustees such periodic and special reports as the Adviser or the"
"2786","Board may reasonably request;"
"2787","      (f)	The Sub-Adviser shall provide the Trust's custodian and fund accountant on each"
"2788","business day with information about Fund transactions in securities and other financial"
"2789","instruments for which it is responsible, and with such other information relating to the Trust as"
"2790","may be required under the terms of the then-current custody agreement between the Trust and"
"2791","the custodian;"
"2792","      (g)	With respect to the Sub-Advised Assets, the Sub-Adviser shall respond as quickly"
"2793","as reasonably possible to any request from the Adviser or the Fund's fund accountant for"
"2794","assistance in obtaining price sources for securities or other financial instruments held by the"
"2795","Fund or determining a price when a price source is not available, and shall periodically review"
"2796","the prices used by the fund accountant to determine net asset value and advise the fund"
"2797","accountant promptly if any price appears to be incorrect;"
"2798","      (h)	With respect to the Sub-Advised Assets, the Sub-Adviser shall vote all proxies"
"2799","solicited by or with respect to the issuers of securities in which assets of the Fund may be"
"2800","invested from time to time.  Such proxies will be voted in a manner that the Sub-Adviser deems,"
"2801","in good faith, to be in the best interests of the Fund and in accordance with the Sub-Adviser's"
"2802","proxy voting policy.  The Sub-Adviser shall provided a copy of its proxy voting policy, and any"
"2803","amendments thereto, to the Adviser prior to the execution of this Agreement;"
"2804","      (i)	The Sub-Adviser hereby represents that it has adopted a written code of ethics"
"2805","complying with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and will provide the Adviser"
"2806","and the Trust with a copy of the code and evidence of its adoption.  Within 45 days of the last"
"2807","calendar quarter of each year while this Agreement is in effect, the Sub-Adviser shall provide to"
"2808","the Board a written report that describes any issues arising under the code of ethics since the last"
"2809","report to the Board, including, but not limited to, information about material violations of the"
"2810","code and sanctions imposed in response to the material violations; and which certifies that the"
"2811","Sub-Adviser has adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent access persons (as that"
"2812","term is defined in Rule 17j-1) from violating the code;"
"2813","      (j)	The Sub-Adviser agrees to maintain adequate compliance procedures to ensure its"
"2814","compliance with the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and other"
"2815","applicable federal and state regulations with respect to its trading for the Fund.  The Sub-Adviser"
"2816","shall provide to the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer the executive summary of its annual"
"2817","written report regarding the Sub-Adviser's compliance program."
"2818","      (k)	Unless and until the Sub-Adviser is otherwise informed in writing, it is intended"
"2819","that all Fund assets without exception serve as segregated assets for the Sub-Adviser's"
"2820","compliance, with respect to its own trading, with the 1940 Act's applicable rules of asset"
"2821","segregation.  The Adviser shall therefore cause all assets of the Fund not allocated to the Sub-"
"2822","Adviser for its own trading to be held in an account marked as a segregated account."
"2823","      (l)	Some of the trading of the Sub-Adviser's investment program may be done in the"
"2824","Fund's wholly owned subsidiary, LCMFS Fund Limited, as determined by the Adviser with the"
"2825","Sub-Adviser's consent."
"2826","      (m)	The Sub-Adviser shall promptly notify the Adviser of any circumstance that could"
"2827","reasonably be deemed to materially affect its ability to perform its obligations and services as"
"2828","described in the Sub-Advisory Agreement or that could have a negative impact on the Fund and"
"2829","the Adviser.  Such circumstances, could include, but are not limited to, items such as:"
"2830","1)	any potential legal or regulatory actions or litigation pertaining to the Sub-Adviser"
"2831","or any of its key employees and the disclosure of the results of those actions;"
"2832","2)	any material operational disruptions caused by the loss of functionality for key"
"2833","personnel or systems;"
"2834","3)	Any circumstance that would cause the Fund to revise its offering documents or"
"2835","marketing material."
"2836","      Section 3.	Execution of Purchase and Sale Orders. In connection with purchases"
"2837","or sales of portfolio securities or other financial instruments for the account of the Fund, the Sub-"
"2838","Adviser will arrange for the placing of all orders for their purchase and sale for the account with"
"2839","brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser's selection of brokers and dealers"
"2840","will be reviewed by the Board from time to time. The Sub-Adviser will be responsible for the"
"2841","negotiation and the allocation of principal business and portfolio brokerage. In the selection of"
"2842","such brokers or dealers and the placing of such orders, the Sub-Adviser will at all times seek for"
"2843","the Fund the best execution, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable"
"2844","brokerage commission or dealer spread), the execution capability, financial responsibility and"
"2845","responsiveness of the broker or dealer and the brokerage and research services provided by the"
"2846","broker or dealer."
"2847","            The Sub-Adviser should generally seek favorable prices and commission rates"
"2848","that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. In seeking best execution, the Sub-"
"2849","Adviser is authorized to select brokers or dealers who also provide brokerage and research"
"2850","services to the Fund and/or the other accounts over which it exercises investment discretion. The"
"2851","Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research"
"2852","services a commission for executing a Fund portfolio transaction that is in excess of the amount"
"2853","of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the"
"2854","Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that the amount of the commission is reasonable in relation"
"2855","to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the executing broker or dealer."
"2856","The determination may be viewed in terms of either a particular transaction or the Sub-Adviser's"
"2857","overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to accounts over which the Sub-Adviser"
"2858","exercises investment discretion. The Trust and the Sub-Adviser understand and acknowledge"
"2859","that, although the information may be useful to the Fund and the Sub-Adviser, it is not possible"
"2860","to place a dollar value on such information. The Board shall periodically review the commissions"
"2861","paid by the Fund to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were"
"2862","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Fund.  The Sub-Adviser may not give consideration"
"2863","to sales of shares of the Fund as a factor in the selection of brokers and dealers to execute Fund"
"2864","portfolio transactions."
"2865","            Subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act, and other applicable law, the Sub-"
"2866","Adviser, any of its affiliates or any affiliates of its affiliates may retain compensation in"
"2867","connection with effecting the Fund's portfolio transactions, including transactions effected"
"2868","through others.  If any occasion should arise in which the Sub-Adviser gives any advice to"
"2869","clients of the Sub-Adviser concerning the shares of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will act solely as"
"2870","investment counsel for such client and not in any way on behalf of the Fund."
"2871","      Section 4.	Services to Other Companies or Accounts.  The Sub-Adviser's services"
"2872","to the Fund pursuant to this Agreement are not to be deemed to be exclusive and it is understood"
"2873","that the Sub-Adviser may render investment advice, management and other services to others,"
"2874","including other registered investment companies.  The Adviser understands that the persons"
"2875","employed by the Sub-Adviser to assist in the performance of the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder"
"2876","will not devote their full time to such service and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit"
"2877","or restrict the right of the Sub-Adviser or any affiliate of the Sub-Advisor to engage in and devote"
"2878","time and attention to other business or to render services of whatever kind or nature. The Sub-"
"2879","Adviser agrees to maintain a minimum of $[_________] in capacity for the Fund through"
"2880","[_____________].  During the term of the Agreement and for one year thereafter, each party"
"2881","agrees not to engage or employ the other party's employees who have been employed at any time"
"2882","during the term of the Agreement."
"2883","      Section 5.	Books and Records. The Sub-Adviser shall keep the books and records"
"2884","required to be maintained by it pursuant to Section 2(e) of this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser"
"2885","agrees that all records that it maintains for the Trust are the property of the Trust and it will"
"2886","promptly surrender any of such records to the Trust upon the Trust's request. The Sub-Adviser"
"2887","further agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any such"
"2888","records as are required to be maintained by the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Trust by Rule 31a-"
"2889","1 under the 1940 Act."
"2890","      Section 6.	Expenses of the Sub-Adviser. During the term of this Agreement, the"
"2891","Sub-Adviser will pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities under this"
"2892","Agreement other than the cost of securities and investments purchased for the Fund (including"
"2893","taxes and brokerage commissions, if any).  All other expenses to be incurred in the operation of the"
"2894","Fund will be borne by the Fund, except to the extent specifically assumed by the Sub-Adviser, the"
"2895","Adviser or a third party.  The Sub-Adviser may provide financial support for various activities"
"2896","upon mutual consent of all parties."
"2897","      Section 7.	Compensation of the Sub-Adviser. For the services provided and the"
"2898","expenses borne pursuant to this Agreement, the Adviser will pay to the Sub-Adviser as full"
"2899","compensation the fees as specified in Appendix A attached hereto.  The Adviser agrees to provide"
"2900","sufficient information to the Sub-Adviser to support the Adviser's determination of the amount"
"2901","payable.  This fee for each month will be paid to the Sub-Adviser during the succeeding month."
"2902","The Adviser is solely responsible for the payment of the Sub-Adviser's fees, and the Sub-Adviser"
"2903","agrees not to seek payment of its fees from the Trust."
"2904","      Section 8.	Use of Names. The Trust, Adviser and Sub-Adviser acknowledge that all"
"2905","rights to the name LoCorr belong to the Adviser and all rights to the name [____________]"
"2906","belong to the Sub-Adviser. In the event the Adviser ceases to be the adviser or the Sub-Adviser"
"2907","ceases to be the Sub-Adviser, the Trust's right to the use of the name LoCorr or"
"2908","[___________], respectively, shall automatically cease on the 90th day following the"
"2909","termination of this Agreement. The right to the name may also be withdrawn by the Adviser or"
"2910","Sub-Adviser during the term of the Management Agreement upon 90 days' written notice,"
"2911","respectively, by the Adviser or by the Sub-Adviser to the Trust. Nothing contained herein shall"
"2912","impair or diminish in any respect the Adviser's right to use the name LoCorr or the Sub-"
"2913","Adviser's right to use the name [____________] in the name of, or in connection with, any other"
"2914","business enterprises with which, respectively, the Adviser or Sub-Adviser or may become"
"2915","associated. There is no charge to the Trust for the right to use either of these names."
"2916","            The Adviser agrees to submit copies of all proposed prospectuses, proxy statements,"
"2917","reports to shareholders, sales literature, or other material prepared for distribution to interest"
"2918","holders of the Fund or the public that refer in any way to the Sub-Adviser (other than identifying"
"2919","the Sub-Adviser as Sub-Adviser to the Fund) to the Sub-Adviser at its principal office for review"
"2920","prior to use, and the Sub-Adviser agrees to review such materials by a reasonable and appropriate"
"2921","deadline. Neither the Adviser, nor the Fund nor any affiliate of the foregoing will use the"
"2922","registered trademarks, service marks, logos, names or any other proprietary designations of Sub-"
"2923","Adviser, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates (collectively, Sub-Adviser Marks) in any advertising or"
"2924","promotional materials without Sub-Adviser's prior written approval, which will not be"
"2925","unreasonably withheld. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the Adviser will continue to"
"2926","furnish to the Sub-Adviser copies of any of the above-mentioned materials that refer in any way to"
"2927","the Sub-Adviser. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement."
"2928","      Section 9.	Liability. Neither the Sub-Adviser nor its shareholders, members, officers,"
"2929","directors, employees, agents, control persons or affiliates of any thereof, shall be liable for any"
"2930","error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Fund in connection with the"
"2931","matters to which this Agreement relates except a loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty"
"2932","with respect to the receipt of compensation for services (in which case any award of damages shall"
"2933","be limited to the period and the amount set forth in Section 36(b)(3) of the 1940 Act) or a loss"
"2934","resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the performance of"
"2935","its duties or from reckless disregard by it of its obligations and duties under this Agreement."
"2936","            Any person, even though also a director, officer, employee, shareholder, member or"
"2937","agent of the Sub-Adviser, who may be or become an officer, director, trustee, employee or agent of"
"2938","the Trust, shall be deemed, when rendering services to the Trust or acting on any business of the"
"2939","Trust (other than services or business in connection with the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder), to be"
"2940","rendering such services to or acting solely for the Trust and not as a director, officer, employee,"
"2941","shareholder, member or agent of the Sub-Adviser, or one under the Sub-Adviser's control or"
"2942","direction, even though paid by the Sub-Adviser."
"2943","      Section 10.	Duration and Termination. The term of this Agreement shall begin on"
"2944","the date that the Fund commences operations and shall continue in effect for a period of two years"

"2948","Fund or by vote of the Trust's Board of Trustees, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose"

"2950","parties to this Agreement or interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of any party to this"
"2951","Agreement, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval.  The"
"2952","Sub-Adviser shall furnish to the Adviser and the Trust, promptly upon their request, such"
"2953","information as may reasonably be necessary to evaluate the terms of this Agreement or any"
"2954","extension, renewal or amendment thereof."
"2955","            This Agreement may be terminated at any time on at least 60 day's prior written"
"2956","notice to the Sub-Adviser, without the payment of any penalty, (i) by vote of the Board of"
"2957","Trustees, (ii) by the Adviser, (iii) by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as"

"3092","      SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT, dated as of __________, 2016, between LoCorr Fund"
"3093","Management, LLC (the Adviser), and Revolution Capital Management, LLC (the Sub-

"3094","      WHEREAS, the Adviser acts as an investment adviser to LoCorr Managed Futures"
"3095","Strategy Fund (the Fund), a series of shares of beneficial interest of the LoCorr Investment"
"3096","Trust, an Ohio business trust (the Trust), pursuant to an Management Agreement dated as of"
"3097","____________________, 20__ (the Management Agreement);"
"3098","      WHEREAS, the Trust is an open-end management investment company registered under"
"3099","the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act); and"
"3100","      WHEREAS, the Adviser desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to render investment advisory"
"3101","services to the Fund, and the Sub-Adviser is willing to render such services."
"3102","      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual agreements"
"3103","hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:"
"3104","      Section 1.	Appointment and Status of Sub-Adviser. The Adviser hereby appoints"
"3105","the Sub-Adviser to provide investment advisory services to the Fund for the period and on the"
"3106","terms set forth in this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser accepts such appointment and agrees to render"
"3107","the services herein set forth, for the compensation herein provided. The Sub-Adviser shall for all"
"3108","purposes herein be deemed to be an independent contractor of the Adviser and the Trust and shall,"
"3109","unless otherwise expressly provided herein or authorized by the Adviser or the Board of Trustees"
"3110","of the Trust from time to time, have no authority to act for or represent the Adviser or the Trust in"
"3111","any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Adviser or the Trust."
"3112","      Section 2.	Sub-Adviser's Duties.  Subject to the general supervision of the Trust's"
"3113","Board of Trustees (the Board) and the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser shall, employing its discretion,"

"3115","by the Adviser (the Sub-Advised Assets) as well as the notional trading size of the Sub-Adviser"
"3116","Assets , including the purchase, retention and disposition thereof and the execution of agreements"
"3117","relating thereto, in accordance with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and restrictions as"
"3118","stated in the Fund's most recent Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information that have"
"3119","been provided to Sub-Adviser by Adviser (together, the Prospectus) and subject to the following"
"3120","understandings:"
"3121","      (a)	The Sub-Adviser shall furnish a continuous investment program for the Sub-"
"3122","Advised Assets and determine from time to time, with respect to the Sub-Advised Assets, what"
"3123","investments or securities will be purchased, retained or sold by the Fund and what portion of the"
"3124","Sub-Advised Assets will be invested or held uninvested as cash;"
"3125","      (b)	The Sub-Adviser shall use its best judgment in the performance of its duties under"
"3126","this Agreement;"
"3127","      (c)	The Sub-Adviser, in the performance of its duties and obligations under this"
"3128","Agreement for the Fund, shall act in conformity with the most recent version of the Trust's"
"3129","Declaration of Trust, its By-Laws and the Fund's Prospectus that have been provided to it by the"
"3130","Adviser and with the reasonable instructions and directions of the Trust's Board of Trustees and"
"3131","the Adviser, and will conform to and comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act and all other"
"3132","applicable federal and state laws and regulations;"
"3133","      (d)	The Sub-Adviser shall place portfolio transactions pursuant to its determinations"
"3134","either directly with the issuer or with any broker and/or dealer in such securities or financial"
"3135","instruments, subject to Section 3 below;"
"3136","      (e)	The Sub-Adviser shall maintain books and records with respect to the transactions"
"3137","in securities and other financial instruments of the Sub-Advised Assets and shall render to the"
"3138","Adviser and the Trust's Board of Trustees such periodic and special reports as the Adviser or the"
"3139","Board may reasonably request;"
"3140","      (f)	The Sub-Adviser shall provide the Trust's custodian and fund accountant on each"
"3141","business day with information about Fund transactions in securities and other financial"
"3142","instruments for which it is responsible, and with such other information relating to the Trust as"
"3143","may be required under the terms of the then-current custody agreement between the Trust and"
"3144","the custodian;"
"3145","      (g)	With respect to the Sub-Advised Assets, the Sub-Adviser shall respond as quickly"
"3146","as reasonably possible to any request from the Adviser or the Fund's fund accountant for"
"3147","assistance in obtaining price sources for securities or other financial instruments held by the"
"3148","Fund or determining a price when a price source is not available, and shall periodically review"
"3149","the prices used by the fund accountant to determine net asset value and advise the fund"
"3150","accountant promptly if any price appears to be incorrect;"
"3151","      (h)	With respect to the Sub-Advised Assets, the Sub-Adviser shall vote all proxies"
"3152","solicited by or with respect to the issuers of securities in which assets of the Fund may be"
"3153","invested from time to time.  Such proxies will be voted in a manner that the Sub-Adviser deems,"
"3154","in good faith, to be in the best interests of the Fund and in accordance with the Sub-Adviser's"
"3155","proxy voting policy.  The Sub-Adviser shall provided a copy of its proxy voting policy, and any"
"3156","amendments thereto, to the Adviser prior to the execution of this Agreement;"
"3157","      (i)	The Sub-Adviser hereby represents that it has adopted a written code of ethics"
"3158","complying with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and will provide the Adviser"
"3159","and the Trust with a copy of the code and evidence of its adoption.  Within 45 days of the last"
"3160","calendar quarter of each year while this Agreement is in effect, the Sub-Adviser shall provide to"
"3161","the Board a written report that describes any issues arising under the code of ethics since the last"
"3162","report to the Board, including, but not limited to, information about material violations of the"
"3163","code and sanctions imposed in response to the material violations; and which certifies that the"
"3164","Sub-Adviser has adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent access persons (as that"
"3165","term is defined in Rule 17j-1) from violating the code;"
"3166","      (j)	The Sub-Adviser agrees to maintain adequate compliance procedures to ensure its"
"3167","compliance with the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and other"
"3168","applicable federal and state regulations with respect to its trading for the Fund.  The Sub-Adviser"
"3169","shall provide to the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer the executive summary of its annual"
"3170","written report regarding the Sub-Adviser's compliance program."
"3171","      (k)	Unless and until the Sub-Adviser is otherwise informed in writing, it is intended"
"3172","that all Fund assets without exception serve as segregated assets for the Sub-Adviser's"
"3173","compliance, with respect to its own trading, with the 1940 Act's applicable rules of asset"
"3174","segregation.  The Adviser shall therefore cause all assets of the Fund not allocated to the Sub-"
"3175","Adviser for its own trading to be held in an account marked as a segregated account."
"3176","      (l)	Some of the trading of the Sub-Adviser's investment program may be done in the"
"3177","Fund's wholly owned subsidiary, LCMFS Fund Limited, as determined by the Adviser with the"
"3178","Sub-Adviser's consent."
"3179","      (m)	The Sub-Adviser shall promptly notify the Adviser of any circumstance that could"
"3180","reasonably be deemed to materially affect its ability to perform its obligations and services as"
"3181","described in the Sub-Advisory Agreement or that could have a negative impact on the Fund and"
"3182","the Adviser.  Such circumstances, could include, but are not limited to, items such as:"
"3183","1)	any potential legal or regulatory actions or litigation pertaining to the Sub-Adviser"
"3184","or any of its key employees and the disclosure of the results of those actions;"
"3185","2)	any material operational disruptions caused by the loss of functionality for key"
"3186","personnel or systems;"
"3187","3)	Any circumstance that would cause the Fund to revise its offering documents or"
"3188","marketing material."
"3189","      Section 3.	Execution of Purchase and Sale Orders. In connection with purchases"
"3190","or sales of portfolio securities or other financial instruments for the account of the Fund, the Sub-"
"3191","Adviser will arrange for the placing of all orders for their purchase and sale for the account with"
"3192","brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser's selection of brokers and dealers"
"3193","will be reviewed by the Board from time to time. The Sub-Adviser will be responsible for the"
"3194","negotiation and the allocation of principal business and portfolio brokerage. In the selection of"
"3195","such brokers or dealers and the placing of such orders, the Sub-Adviser will at all times seek for"
"3196","the Fund the best execution, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable"
"3197","brokerage commission or dealer spread), the execution capability, financial responsibility and"
"3198","responsiveness of the broker or dealer and the brokerage and research services provided by the"
"3199","broker or dealer."
"3200","            The Sub-Adviser should generally seek favorable prices and commission rates"
"3201","that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. In seeking best execution, the Sub-"
"3202","Adviser is authorized to select brokers or dealers who also provide brokerage and research"
"3203","services to the Fund and/or the other accounts over which it exercises investment discretion. The"
"3204","Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research"
"3205","services a commission for executing a Fund portfolio transaction that is in excess of the amount"
"3206","of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the"
"3207","Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that the amount of the commission is reasonable in relation"
"3208","to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the executing broker or dealer."
"3209","The determination may be viewed in terms of either a particular transaction or the Sub-Adviser's"
"3210","overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to accounts over which the Sub-Adviser"
"3211","exercises investment discretion. The Trust and the Sub-Adviser understand and acknowledge"
"3212","that, although the information may be useful to the Fund and the Sub-Adviser, it is not possible"
"3213","to place a dollar value on such information. The Board shall periodically review the commissions"
"3214","paid by the Fund to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were"
"3215","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Fund.  The Sub-Adviser may not give consideration"
"3216","to sales of shares of the Fund as a factor in the selection of brokers and dealers to execute Fund"
"3217","portfolio transactions."
"3218","            Subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act, and other applicable law, the Sub-"
"3219","Adviser, any of its affiliates or any affiliates of its affiliates may retain compensation in"
"3220","connection with effecting the Fund's portfolio transactions, including transactions effected"
"3221","through others.  If any occasion should arise in which the Sub-Adviser gives any advice to"
"3222","clients of the Sub-Adviser concerning the shares of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will act solely as"
"3223","investment counsel for such client and not in any way on behalf of the Fund."
"3224","      Section 4.	Services to Other Companies or Accounts.  The Sub-Adviser's services"
"3225","to the Fund pursuant to this Agreement are not to be deemed to be exclusive and it is understood"
"3226","that the Sub-Adviser may render investment advice, management and other services to others,"
"3227","including other registered investment companies.  The Adviser understands that the persons"
"3228","employed by the Sub-Adviser to assist in the performance of the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder"
"3229","will not devote their full time to such service and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit"
"3230","or restrict the right of the Sub-Adviser or any affiliate of the Sub-Advisor to engage in and devote"
"3231","time and attention to other business or to render services of whatever kind or nature. The Sub-"
"3232","Adviser agrees to maintain a minimum of $[_________] in capacity for the Fund through"
"3233","[_____________].  During the term of the Agreement and for one year thereafter, each party"
"3234","agrees not to engage or employ the other party's employees who have been employed at any time"
"3235","during the term of the Agreement."
"3236","      Section 5.	Books and Records. The Sub-Adviser shall keep the books and records"
"3237","required to be maintained by it pursuant to Section 2(e) of this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser"
"3238","agrees that all records that it maintains for the Trust are the property of the Trust and it will"
"3239","promptly surrender any of such records to the Trust upon the Trust's request. The Sub-Adviser"
"3240","further agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any such"
"3241","records as are required to be maintained by the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Trust by Rule 31a-"
"3242","1 under the 1940 Act."
"3243","      Section 6.	Expenses of the Sub-Adviser. During the term of this Agreement, the"
"3244","Sub-Adviser will pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities under this"
"3245","Agreement other than the cost of securities and investments purchased for the Fund (including"
"3246","taxes and brokerage commissions, if any).  All other expenses to be incurred in the operation of the"
"3247","Fund will be borne by the Fund, except to the extent specifically assumed by the Sub-Adviser, the"
"3248","Adviser or a third party.  The Sub-Adviser may provide financial support for various activities"
"3249","upon mutual consent of all parties."
"3250","      Section 7.	Compensation of the Sub-Adviser. For the services provided and the"
"3251","expenses borne pursuant to this Agreement, the Adviser will pay to the Sub-Adviser as full"
"3252","compensation the fees as specified in Appendix A attached hereto.  The Adviser agrees to provide"
"3253","sufficient information to the Sub-Adviser to support the Adviser's determination of the amount"
"3254","payable.  This fee for each month will be paid to the Sub-Adviser during the succeeding month."
"3255","The Adviser is solely responsible for the payment of the Sub-Adviser's fees, and the Sub-Adviser"
"3256","agrees not to seek payment of its fees from the Trust."
"3257","      Section 8.	Use of Names. The Trust, Adviser and Sub-Adviser acknowledge that all"
"3258","rights to the name LoCorr belong to the Adviser and all rights to the name [____________]"
"3259","belong to the Sub-Adviser. In the event the Adviser ceases to be the adviser or the Sub-Adviser"
"3260","ceases to be the Sub-Adviser, the Trust's right to the use of the name LoCorr or"
"3261","[___________], respectively, shall automatically cease on the 90th day following the"
"3262","termination of this Agreement. The right to the name may also be withdrawn by the Adviser or"
"3263","Sub-Adviser during the term of the Management Agreement upon 90 days' written notice,"
"3264","respectively, by the Adviser or by the Sub-Adviser to the Trust. Nothing contained herein shall"
"3265","impair or diminish in any respect the Adviser's right to use the name LoCorr or the Sub-"
"3266","Adviser's right to use the name [____________] in the name of, or in connection with, any other"
"3267","business enterprises with which, respectively, the Adviser or Sub-Adviser or may become"
"3268","associated. There is no charge to the Trust for the right to use either of these names."
"3269","            The Adviser agrees to submit copies of all proposed prospectuses, proxy statements,"
"3270","reports to shareholders, sales literature, or other material prepared for distribution to interest"
"3271","holders of the Fund or the public that refer in any way to the Sub-Adviser (other than identifying"
"3272","the Sub-Adviser as Sub-Adviser to the Fund) to the Sub-Adviser at its principal office for review"
"3273","prior to use, and the Sub-Adviser agrees to review such materials by a reasonable and appropriate"
"3274","deadline. Neither the Adviser, nor the Fund nor any affiliate of the foregoing will use the"
"3275","registered trademarks, service marks, logos, names or any other proprietary designations of Sub-"
"3276","Adviser, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates (collectively, Sub-Adviser Marks) in any advertising or"
"3277","promotional materials without Sub-Adviser's prior written approval, which will not be"
"3278","unreasonably withheld. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the Adviser will continue to"
"3279","furnish to the Sub-Adviser copies of any of the above-mentioned materials that refer in any way to"
"3280","the Sub-Adviser. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement."

"3372","information relating to the Trust and the securities  and other investment holdings of the Fund as"
"3373","confidential and shall not disclose any such records or information to any other person unless (i)"

"3382","information that it may be entitled or bound to disclose by law, regulation or that is disclosed to"

"3390","the investment program and the Adviser acknowledges and agrees on behalf of both itself and"

"3445","      SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT, dated as of July 29th 2015, between LoCorr Fund"
"3446","Management, LLC (the Adviser), and Kettle Hill Capital Management, LLC (the Sub-
Adviser)."
"3447","      WHEREAS, the Adviser is registered as an investment adviser with the Securities and"
"3448","Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers
Act);"
"3449","      WHEREAS, the Adviser acts as an investment adviser to LoCorr Long/Short Equity"
"3450","Fund (the Fund), a series of shares of beneficial interest of the LoCorr Investment Trust, an
Ohio business trust (the Trust), pursuant to a Management Agreement dated as of January 24,
2011 (the Management Agreement);
      WHEREAS, the Trust is an open-end management investment company registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act);
      WHEREAS, the Adviser desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to render investment advisory
services to the Fund, and the Sub-Adviser is willing to render such services; and
      WHEREAS, the Adviser has the authority, subject to the approval of the Board (as
defined in Section 2 below) and, if required under the 1940 Act, Fund shareholders, to select
sub-advisers for the Fund.
      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual agreements
hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:
      Section 1.	Appointment and Status of Sub-Adviser. The Adviser hereby appoints
the Sub-Adviser to provide investment advisory services to the Fund for the period and on the
terms set forth in this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser accepts such appointment and agrees to
render the services herein set forth, for the compensation herein provided. In connection
therewith, the Adviser has delivered or will promptly deliver to the Sub-Adviser copies of (i) the
Trust's Declaration of Trust and By-Laws and any amendments thereto, (ii) the Trust's
Registration Statement and all amendments thereto filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act),
or the 1940 Act (the Registration Statement), (iii) the current Prospectus and Statement of
Additional Information of the Fund (collectively, as currently in effect and as amended or
supplemented, the Prospectus), and (iv) all procedures adopted by the Trust with respect to the
Fund and all written instructions adopted by the Board with respect to the Fund, and shall
promptly furnish the Subadviser with all amendments of or supplements to the foregoing.  In
addition, the Adviser shall deliver to the Sub-Adviser (x) a certified copy of the resolutions of
the Board appointing the Sub-Adviser and authorizing the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, (y) a copy of all proxy statements and related materials relating to the Fund (if any),
and (z) any other documents, materials or information that the Sub-Adviser may reasonably
request to enable it to perform its duties pursuant to this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser shall for
all purposes herein be deemed to be an independent contractor of the Adviser and the Trust and
shall, unless otherwise expressly provided herein or authorized by the Adviser or the Board from
time to time, have no authority to act for or represent the Adviser or the Trust in any way or
otherwise be deemed an agent of the Adviser or the Trust. The Adviser hereby delegates to the
Sub-Adviser the authority, as agent and attorney-in-fact for the Trust or Fund, as applicable, for
the account of, at the risk of and in the name of the Trust or the Fund, as applicable, to place
orders and issue instructions with respect to purchases and sales of securities and other
investment assets of the Fund.
      Section 2.	Sub-Adviser's Duties.  Subject to the general supervision of the Board
and the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser shall, employing its discretion, manage the investment and
reinvestment for that portion of the Fund' assets that are assigned to the Sub-Adviser by the
Adviser (the Sub-Advised Assets), including the purchase, retention and disposition thereof
and the execution of agreements relating thereto, in accordance with the Fund' investment
objectives, policies and restrictions as disclosed in the Fund's Prospectus, using similar or
substantially similar investment strategies that, as of the date of this Agreement, are currently
used by the Sub-Adviser with respect to the fund(s) listed on Schedule 1 hereto, and any written
investment guidelines of the Fund that (i) have been approved by the Board, (ii) are disclosed in
the Prospectus, and (iii) have been provided to the Sub-Adviser, and subject to the following
understandings:
      (a)	The Sub-Adviser shall furnish a continuous investment program for the Sub-
Advised Assets and determine from time to time, with respect to the Sub-Advised Assets, what
investments or securities will be purchased, retained or sold by the Fund and what portion of the
Sub-Advised Assets will be invested or held uninvested as cash;
      (b)	The Sub-Adviser shall use its best judgment in the performance of its duties under
this Agreement;
      (c)	The Sub-Adviser, in the performance of its duties and obligations under this
Agreement, shall comply with the reasonable written instructions and directions of the Board,
which instructions and directions shall not be inconsistent with the Prospectus, as the Adviser
reasonably determines may be necessary or appropriate in order for the Fund to be in compliance
with (i) the most recent version of the Trust's Declaration of Trust, (ii) the Trust's By-Laws, (iii)
the Fund's investment objectives, policies and restrictions as stated in the Prospectus, and (iv)
applicable requirements of the 1940 Act and all other applicable federal and state laws and
regulations. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Sub-Adviser shall have no responsibility
for monitoring any portion of the Fund's portfolio that is not being managed by Sub-Adviser,
and that as a result the Sub-Adviser will not be responsible for the Fund's compliance with any
requirements relating to its portfolio as a whole;
      (d)	The Sub-Adviser shall place portfolio transactions pursuant to its determinations
either directly with the issuer or with any broker and/or dealer in such securities, subject to
Section 3 below;
      (e)	The Sub-Adviser shall maintain books and records with respect to the securities
transactions of the Sub-Advised Assets as it is required to maintain pursuant to Rules 31a-1 and
31a-2 under the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser (or the broker, at the Sub-Adviser's discretion) shall
render to the Adviser and the Board such periodic and special reports as the Adviser or the Board
may reasonably request;
      (f)	The Sub-Adviser (or the broker, at the Sub-Adviser's discretion) shall provide the
Trust's custodian and fund accountant on each business day with information about securities
transactions under the Sub-Adviser's control as the custodian and fund accountant may
reasonably require under the terms of the then-current custody agreement between the Trust and
the custodian;
      (g)	With respect to the Sub-Advised Assets, the Sub-Adviser shall respond as quickly
as reasonably practicable to any request from the Adviser or the fund accountant for assistance in
obtaining price sources for securities held by the Fund or determining a price when a price
source is not available, and shall periodically review the prices used by the fund accountant to
determine net asset value and advise the fund accountant promptly if any price appears to be
incorrect, but in no event shall the Sub-Adviser be responsible for determining the final valuation
of an asset;
      (h)	With respect to the Sub-Advised Assets, the Sub-Adviser shall vote all proxies
solicited by or with respect to the issuers of securities in which assets of the Fund may be
invested from time to time.  Such proxies will be voted in accordance with the Sub-Adviser's
proxy voting policy, a copy of which has been provided to the Board.  The Sub-Adviser shall
provide a copy of its proxy voting policy, and any amendments thereto, to the Adviser prior to
the execution of this Agreement;
      (i)	The Sub-Adviser hereby represents that it has adopted a written code of ethics
(the code) to ensure compliance with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and
will provide the Adviser and the Board with a copy of the code and evidence of its adoption.
Within 45 days of the last calendar quarter of each year while this Agreement is in effect, the
Sub-Adviser shall provide to the Board a written report that describes any issues arising under
the code since the last report to the Board, including, but not limited to, information about
material violations of the code and sanctions imposed in response to the material violations; and
which certifies that the Sub-Adviser has adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent
access persons (as that term is defined in Rule 17j-1) from violating the code;
      (j)	The Sub-Adviser agrees to maintain adequate compliance procedures to ensure its
compliance with applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act and other applicable
federal and state regulations, which procedures have been reviewed and approved by the Board
of Trustees of the Trust.  The Sub-Adviser shall, following the effective date of this Agreement,
provide to the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer an executive summary of its next completed
annual written report regarding the Sub-Adviser's compliance program within a reasonable time
following preparation of such annual written report.
      (k)	The Sub-Adviser, during the term of this Agreement, agrees to maintain its
registration as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Advisers Act.
      (l)	The Sub-Adviser, during the term of this Agreement, shall promptly notify the
Adviser of any circumstance that could materially impede the ability of the Sub-Adviser to
perform its services as described in this Agreement.  Such circumstances, to be determined in the
Sub-Adviser's sole discretion, could include, but are not limited to, items such as: litigation or
regulatory actions pertaining to the Sub-Adviser or any of its key employees and any material
operational disruptions caused by the loss of functionality for key employees or systems.
      Section 3.	Execution of Purchase and Sale Orders. With respect to the Sub-
Advised Assets, in connection with purchases or sales of portfolio securities for the accounts of
the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will arrange for the placing of all orders for the purchase and sale of
portfolio securities for the account with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-
Adviser's selection of brokers and dealers will be reviewed by the Board from time to time. The
Sub-Adviser will be responsible for the negotiation and the allocation of principal business and
portfolio brokerage. In the selection of such brokers or dealers and the placing of such orders, the
Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek to obtain for the Fund best execution, considering
all of the circumstances.  Subject to its obligations under this Section 3, the Sub-Adviser shall be
permitted to aggregate trades for the purchase and sale of the Fund's portfolio securities and
allocate such securities in accordance with the Sub-Adviser's aggregation and allocation policies
and procedures.
            The Sub-Adviser should generally seek favorable prices and commission rates
that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. In seeking best execution, the Sub-
Adviser is authorized to select brokers or dealers who also provide brokerage and research
services to the Fund and/or the other accounts over which it exercises investment discretion. The
Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research
services a commission for executing the Fund' portfolio transaction that is in excess of the
amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction
if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that the amount of the commission is reasonable in
relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the executing broker or
dealer. The determination may be viewed in terms of either a particular transaction or the Sub-
Adviser's overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to accounts over which the Sub-
Adviser exercises investment discretion. The Adviser and the Sub-Adviser understand and
acknowledge that, although the information may be useful to the Fund and the Sub-Adviser, it is
not possible to place a dollar value on such information. The Board shall periodically review the
commissions paid by the Fund to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods
of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Fund.  The Sub-Adviser may not give
consideration to sales of shares of the Fund as a factor in the selection of brokers and dealers to
execute the Fund's portfolio transactions.
      Section 4.	Services to Other Companies or Accounts.  The Sub-Adviser's services
to the Fund pursuant to this Agreement are not to be deemed to be exclusive and it is understood
that the Sub-Adviser may render investment advice, management and other services to others,
including other registered investment companies or series thereof that may or may not have
similar investment strategies as those of the Fund. The Adviser recognizes that, in some cases,
having multiple clients for which a particular investment may be suitable may limit the size of
the position of that investment that may be acquired or sold for the Fund.  In addition, the
Adviser understands that the persons employed by the Sub-Adviser to assist in the performance
of the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder will not devote their full time to such service and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to limit or restrict the right of the Sub-Adviser or any affiliate
of the Sub-Adviser to engage in and devote time and attention to other business or to render
services of whatever kind or nature. During the term of this Agreement and for one year
thereafter, each party agrees not to engage and/or employ the other party's employees.
	Section 5.	Books and Records. The Sub-Adviser shall keep the books and records
required to be maintained by it pursuant to Section 2(e) of this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser
agrees that all records that it is required to maintain  with respect to the Sub-Advised Assets
under this Agreement are the property of the Trust, and it will promptly surrender any of such
records to the Trust upon the Trust's request. The Sub-Adviser may maintain copies of any such
books and records for its own records.
	Section 6.	Expenses of the Sub-Adviser. During the term of this Agreement, the
Sub-Adviser will pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities under this
Agreement, other than the cost of securities and other investments (including, without limitation,
taxes and brokerage commissions, interest on margin borrowing, custodial fees, dividends
payable with respect to securities sold short, interest on account-related loans and debit balances,
if any) purchased, retained or sold for the Fund.  All other expenses to be incurred in the
operation of the Fund will be borne by the Fund, except to the extent specifically assumed by the
Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser shall not be responsible for the Adviser's expenses, including any
extraordinary and non-recurring expenses.
      Section 7.	Compensation of the Sub-Adviser. For the services provided and the
expenses borne pursuant to this Agreement, the Adviser will pay to the Sub-Adviser as
compensation at the rates set forth in Schedule A hereto. Pertaining to Section 7 and Schedule A,
Sub-Advised Assets shall refer to the assets assigned by the Adviser to the Sub-Adviser for
LoCorr Long/Short Equity Fund.  Subsequent to the effective date of this Agreement, Sub-
Advisor shall promptly notify the Adviser if the Sub-Adviser enters into a sub-advisory with
respect to a registered open-end investment company or series thereof  that is a multi-manager
fund that uses the Sub-Adviser's long-short investment strategy similar to that used to manage
the Sub-Advised Assets pursuant to this Agreement (each, an other sub-advisory agreement),
if, pursuant to such other sub-advisory agreement, the Sub-Adviser will receive a fee lower than
the fee to be paid to the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement.  In the event that the Sub-
Adviser enters into any such other sub-advisory agreement, the Sub-Adviser agrees to reduce
the compensation to which it is entitled pursuant to this Agreement so that it is no higher than the
fee paid pursuant to the other sub-advisory agreement, subject to approval of the Board of
Trustees of the Trust and Fund shareholders, if required. The Sub-Advised Assets within the
Trust are aggregated in determining the appropriate fee level(s) to be used in the fee calculation.
This fee for each month will be paid to the Sub-Adviser during the succeeding month within five
business days after the month-end, and payment will be made by bank wire transfer per
instructions furnished by the Sub-Adviser.  The monthly fee will also be accompanied by a
statement from the fund accountant or the Adviser, which details the calculation of the fee.  In
addition, upon termination of the Agreement, the monthly fee shall become due and owing to the
Sub-Adviser promptly after the termination of this Agreement as of the next fee payment date;
and the fee will be prorated for such fees owed and due through the termination date.  The Sub-
Adviser agrees to manage up to $200 million in the Fund' Sub-Advised Assets.
            The Adviser is solely responsible for the payment of the Sub-Adviser's fees, and
the Sub-Adviser agrees not to seek payment of its fees from the Trust or the Fund.
      Section 8.	Use of Names. The Sub-Adviser acknowledges that it has no rights to the
name LoCorr and the Sub-Adviser will make no use of such name without the express written
consent of the Trust, the Fund or the Adviser, as the case may be; provided that the Sub-Adviser
shall be entitled to use the Fund's name and the name LoCorr in the Sub-Adviser's Form ADV
or any other document required to be filed with any governmental agency or self-regulatory
organization and in connection with performing the Sub-Adviser's obligations under this
Agreement.
	The Adviser agrees to submit copies of all proposed prospectuses, proxy
statements, reports to shareholders, sales literature, or other material prepared for distribution to
interest holders of the Fund or the public that refer in any way to the Sub-Adviser (other than
identifying the name of the Sub-Adviser as a sub-adviser to the Fund) to the Sub-Adviser at its
principal office (or to an alternate address provided by the Sub-Adviser) for review prior to use,
and the Sub-Adviser agrees to review such materials by a reasonable and appropriate deadline.
The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any disclosures or descriptions included in any of the
foregoing materials that relate to the Sub-Adviser or the Sub-Advised Assets for which it did not
have an opportunity to review and correct any information contained therein. None of the
Adviser, the Trust, the Fund or any affiliate of the foregoing will use the registered trademarks,
service marks, logos, names or any other proprietary designations of Sub-Adviser, its
subsidiaries and/or affiliates in any advertising or promotional materials without Sub-Adviser's
prior written approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld. In the event of termination of
this Agreement, the Adviser will continue to furnish to the Sub-Adviser copies of any of the
above-mentioned materials that refer in any way to the Sub-Adviser. The provisions of this
paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
	The Sub-Adviser agrees to submit copies of all sales literature or other marketing
material of the Sub-Adviser that refer in any way to the Adviser, the Fund, or the Trust to the
Adviser at its principal office (or to an alternate address provided by the Adviser) for review
prior to use, and the Adviser agrees to review such materials by a reasonable and appropriate
deadline. The Adviser, the Trust or the Fund, as applicable, shall not be liable for any disclosures
or descriptions included in any of the foregoing materials that relate to the Sub-Adviser or the
Sub-Advised Assets for which it did not have an opportunity to review and correct any
information contained therein, unless such disclosures or descriptions are consistent with those
included in public filings or materials provided to the Sub-Adviser. Neither the Sub-Adviser nor
any of its affiliates will use the registered trademarks, service marks, logos, names or any other
proprietary designations of (1) Adviser, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates in any advertising or
promotional materials without Adviser's prior written approval, which will not be unreasonably
withheld, or (2) the Fund or the Trust in any advertising or promotional materials without the
Trust's prior written approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld.  In the event of
termination of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will continue to furnish to the Adviser and/or the
Trust, as applicable, copies of any of the above-mentioned materials that refer in any way to the
Adviser or the Trust. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.
      Section 9.	Liability. The Sub-Adviser has not made, and does not make, any
guarantee whatsoever as to the success or profitability of the Sub-Adviser's trading methods and
strategies and the Adviser acknowledges that it has received no such guarantee from the Sub-
Adviser and has not entered into this Agreement in consideration of or in reliance upon any such
guarantee or similar representation from the Sub-Adviser.  Neither the Sub-Adviser nor its
shareholders, members, officers, directors, employees, agents, control persons or affiliates of any
thereof, shall be liable for any error of judgment (including, without limitation, trade errors) or
mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Adviser, the Trust or the Fund (including, without
limitation, by reason of the purchase, retention or sale of securities) in connection with the
matters to which this Agreement relates except a loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty
with respect to the receipt of compensation for services (in which case any award of damages
shall be limited to the period and the amount set forth in Section 36(b)(3) of the 1940 Act) or a
loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the
performance of the Sub-Adviser's duties or from reckless disregard by it of the Sub-Adviser's
obligations and duties under this Agreement.
            The Adviser shall indemnify, and defend the Sub-Adviser and its shareholders,
members, officers, directors, employees, agents, control persons or affiliates of any thereof, and
hold them harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities and expenses
(Losses), as they are incurred, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the business,
operation, or administration of the Trust or the Fund, except to the extent such Losses are
determined to have arisen directly and primarily out of, or have been determined to be based
directly and primarily upon, the Sub-Adviser's breach of fiduciary duty, willful misfeasance, bad
faith or gross negligence in the performance of the Sub-Adviser's duties or from reckless
disregard by it of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.
            The Sub-Adviser shall indemnify, and defend the Adviser and its shareholders,
members, officers, directors, employees, agents, control persons or affiliates of any thereof, and
hold them harmless from and against any and all Losses, as they are incurred, that have been
determined to have arisen directly and primarily out of, or have been determined to be based
directly and primarily upon the Sub-Adviser's breach of fiduciary duty, willful misfeasance, bad
faith or gross negligence in the performance of the Sub-Adviser's duties or from reckless
disregard by it of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.
            Any person, even though also a director, officer, employee, shareholder, member
or agent of the Sub-Adviser, who may be or become an officer, director, trustee, employee or
agent of the Trust, shall be deemed, when rendering services to the Trust or acting on any
business of the Trust (other than services or business in connection with the Sub-Adviser's duties
hereunder), to be rendering such services to or acting solely for the Trust and not as a director,
officer, employee, shareholder, member or agent of the Sub-Adviser, or one under the Sub-
Adviser's control or direction, even though paid by the Sub-Adviser.
      Section 10.	Duration and Termination. The term of this Agreement shall begin on
the date that the Adviser allocates Sub-Advised Assets to the Sub-Adviser, provided that this
Agreement shall have been approved by a majority of the Board members who are not parties to
this Agreement or interested persons of any such party (other than as Board members of the
Trust) and, if required by applicable law, by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities of the Fund, and shall continue in effect for a period of two years.   This Agreement
shall continue in effect from year to year thereafter, subject to termination as hereinafter
provided, if such continuance is specifically approved at least annually (a) by a majority of the
outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of such Fund or by vote of the Board,
and (b) by vote of a majority of the Trustees of the Trust who are not parties to this Agreement or
interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of any party to this Agreement, cast in person at
a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. In the event that the continuation of
this Agreement is not approved as to the Fund, the Sub-Adviser may continue to render to the
Fund the services described herein in the manner and to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. To the extent required by the 1940 Act, the Sub-Adviser
shall furnish to the Adviser and the Trust, promptly upon their request, such information as may
reasonably be necessary to evaluate the terms of this Agreement or any extension, renewal or
amendment thereof.
	This Agreement may be terminated at any time on at least 60 days' prior written notice to
the Sub-Adviser, without the payment of any penalty, (i) by vote of the Board, (ii) by the
Adviser, (iii) by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940
Act) of the Fund, or (iv) 	in accordance with the terms of any exemptive order obtained by the
Trust or the Fund under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, exempting the Trust or the Fund from
Section 15(a) and Rule 18f-2 under the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser may terminate this
Agreement at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on at least 60 days' prior written
notice to the Adviser and the Trust. This Agreement will automatically and immediately
terminate in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).
      Section 11.	Complete Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement between the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser with respect to the subject matter
covered herein and supersedes all prior agreements, oral and written, between the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof.  This Agreement may be amended by mutual consent of
the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser, provided any such amendment is reduced to a written
document signed by authorized officers of the Adviser and Sub-Adviser and the Trust approves
the amendment (a) by vote of a majority of the Trustees of the Trust, including Trustees who are
not parties to this Agreement or interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of any such
party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such amendment, and (b) if
required under then current interpretations of the 1940 Act by the SEC, by vote of a majority of
the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund affected by such
amendment.
      Section 12.	Notices. Notices of any kind to be given in writing and shall be duly given

      Section 13.	Governing Law. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota without regard to the conflicts of laws
principles thereof, and (b) any question of interpretation of any term or provision of this
Agreement having a counterpart in or otherwise derived from a term or provision of the 1940
Act, shall be resolved by reference to such term or provision of the 1940 Act and to
interpretation thereof, if any, by the United States courts or in the absence of any controlling
decision of any such court, by rules, regulations or orders of the SEC issued pursuant to said
1940 Act.  In addition, where the effect of a requirement of the Act reflected in any provision of
this Agreement is revised by rule, regulation or order of the SEC, such provision shall be deemed
to incorporate the effect of such rule, regulation or order.  Except as provided in Section 21
below, the parties hereto waive their right to seek remedies in court, including any right to
a jury trial.  The parties agree that in the event of any dispute arising out of, relating to or in
connection with this Agreement, such dispute shall be resolved exclusively by confidential
arbitration to be conducted in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (AAA)
Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures and applying the laws of State of
Minnesota or the United States, as appropriate.  The costs of arbitration, including the fees and
expenses of the arbitrator, shall be paid equally the parties hereto.  Each party shall bear the cost
of preparing and presenting their case.  Disputes shall not be resolved in any other forum or
venue.  The parties agree that such arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator
experience in resolving similar disputes and that the arbitrator's authority to grant relief shall be
subject to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. ?? 1-16, et seq. (FAA), the provisions of this
Agreement, and the AAA Code of Ethics for Arbitrators in Commercial Disputes.  The parties
hereto agree that the arbitrator shall have no power or authority to make any award that provides
for punitive or exemplary damages or damages otherwise limited or excluded in this Agreement.
The parties understand that their right to appeal or to seek modification of any ruling or award of
the arbitrator is severely limited.  Any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and
binding, and judgment may be entered on it in any court of competent jurisdiction or as
otherwise provided by law.
      Section 14.	Severability.  In the event any provision of this Agreement is determined
to be void or unenforceable, such determination shall not affect the remainder of this Agreement,
which shall continue to be in force.
      Section 15.	Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.
      Section 16.	Binding Effect.  Each of the undersigned expressly warrants and
represents that he has the full power and authority to sign this Agreement on behalf of the party
indicated and that his signature will operate to bind the party indicated to the foregoing terms.
The Adviser further represents that this Agreement has been duly authorized by appropriate
action of the Adviser, the Board and the Fund' shareholders
      Section 17.	Captions.  The captions in this Agreement are included for convenience
of reference only and in no way define or delimit any of the provisions hereto or otherwise affect
their construction or effect.
      Section 18.	Change of Control.  The Sub-Adviser shall seek to notify Adviser and the
Trust in writing at least 60 days' in advance of any change of control, as defined in Section
2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act, of which Sub-Adviser is aware as will enable the Trust to consider
whether an assignment, as defined in Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, would occur.
      Section 19.	Other Business. Except as set forth above, nothing in this Agreement
shall limit or restrict the right of any of the Sub-Adviser's directors, officers or employees who
may also be a trustee, officer, partner or employee of the Trust to engage in any other business or
to devote his or her time and attention in part to the management or other aspects of any
business, whether of a similar or a dissimilar nature, nor limit or restrict the Sub-Adviser's right
to engage in any other business or to render services of any kind to any other corporation, firm,
individual or association.
      Section 20.	      Anti-Money Laundering. The Adviser, on its own behalf and on behalf
of the Fund, confirms that where it is acting as principal or where it is acting on behalf of another
person (notwithstanding that it enters into this Agreement and any transactions as principal), it is
in compliance with the anti-money laundering regulations that apply to it. The Adviser shall
provide any document or information to the Sub-Adviser that the Sub-Adviser may request for
complying with its own anti-money laundering regulations.
      Section 21.	Confidentiality.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 8 of this
Agreement, the Sub-Adviser agrees to treat all records and other information relating to the Trust
and the securities holdings of the Fund as confidential and shall not disclose any such records or
information to any other person (other than the Sub-Adviser's professional advisors, accountants,
officers, employees, interestholders, and counsel) unless (i) the Board has approved the
disclosure or (ii) such disclosure is compelled by law or regulation or information that has
entered into the public domain other than by a breach of duty on the part of the Sub-Adviser.  In
addition, Sub-Adviser, and Sub-Adviser's officers, directors and employees are prohibited from
receiving compensation or other consideration, for themselves or on behalf of the Fund, as a
result of disclosing the Fund' portfolio holdings; provided, however, that the Sub-Adviser and its
officers, directors and employees are permitted to disclose the portfolio holdings of third party
accounts and investment vehicles managed by the Sub-Adviser notwithstanding that such
accounts and investment vehicles may include the portfolio holdings that are the same as or pari
passu with the Fund' portfolio holdings.  Sub-Adviser agrees that, consistent with its Code of
Ethics, neither it nor its officers, directors or employees may engage in personal securities
transactions based on nonpublic information about the Fund' portfolio holdings.
	The Adviser, on its own behalf or on behalf of the Fund, agrees to treat all records and
other information relating to the Sub-Adviser (including, without limitation, the Sub-Adviser's
advice with respect to trading, investments, and market positions or strategies, systems, software
programs, methods, models, techniques and formulas and the Adviser agrees not to reverse
engineer such items) as confidential and shall not disclose information of a confidential nature
acquired in connection with this Agreement, except for information that it may be entitled to
disclose pursuant to this Agreement or required to disclose by law or regulation or information
that has entered into the public domain other than by a breach of duty on the part of the Adviser,
the Fund or Trust.
	Each party recognizes and agrees that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
construed as granting any property rights, by license or otherwise, to any of the other party's
confidential information, or to any invention or any patent, copyright, trademark, or other
intellectual property right that has issued or that may issue, based on the other party's
confidential information to the receiving party or its affiliates.  Neither party shall make, have
made, use or sell (or permit its affiliates to make, have made, use or sell) for any purpose any
product or other item using, incorporating or derived from any of the other party's confidential
information.
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that any market
counterparty with whom the Sub-Adviser deals requires information relating to the Fund
(including, but not limited to, the identity of the Adviser or the Fund or Trust and market value
of the Fund), the Sub-Adviser shall be permitted to disclose such information to the extent
necessary to effect transactions on behalf of the Fund in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.
       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each party  acknowledges
that its breach of this Section 21 may cause irreparable damage and hereby agrees that the non-
breaching party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief under this Agreement, as well as such
further relief as may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.
      This Section 21 shall survive the termination of this Agreement; and shall continue in
perpetuity.
