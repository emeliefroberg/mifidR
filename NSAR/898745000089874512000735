"23735","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"23736","The Shareholders and Board of Directors"
"23737","Principal Funds, Inc."
"23738","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"23739","Principal Funds, Inc. as of and for the period ended October 31, 2012,"
"23740","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"23741"," Board (United States), we considered its internal controls over financial"
"23742"," reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"23743"," designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"23744"," on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"23745"," but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"23746"," Principal Funds, Inc.?s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"23747"," we express no such opinion."
"23748","The management of Principal Funds, Inc. is responsible for establishing and"
"23749"," maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"23750"," this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"23751"," assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company?s"
"23752"," internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"23753"," reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"23754"," preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"23755","generally accepted accounting principles. A company?s internal control over"
"23756","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"23757","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"23758","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"23759","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"23760","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"23761","accepted"
"23762","accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"23763","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"23764","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"23765","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company?s"
"23766","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"23767","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"23768","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"23769","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"23770","become"
"23771","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"23772","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"23773","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"23774","design"
"23775","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"23776","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"23777","misstatements"
"23778","on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"23779","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there"
"23780","is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company?s"
"23781","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"23782","timely basis."
"23783","Our consideration of Principal Funds, Inc.?s internal control over financial"
"23784","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"23785","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might"
"23786","be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"23787","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"23788","in Principal Funds, Inc.?s internal control over financial reporting and its"
"23789","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"23790","to be a material weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2012."

"23946","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research"
"23947","products and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This"
"23948","determination, with respect to brokerage and research products"
"23949","and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either that particular"
"23950","transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor"

"24250","(the Sub-Advisor Percentage Fee):"

connection with the investment advisory services for each series

WHEREAS, the Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies properly

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the
Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services
described in Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of the
securities and other assets of the Series, as well as exercise all
other ancillary rights or duties in connection with the management
of such securities or other assets necessary to implement any of the
powers contained herein, subject to the control and direction of the
Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for the period and on the
terms hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts such
appointment and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter set forth
for the compensation herein provided. The Sub-Advisor shall for all
purposes herein be deemed to be an independent contractor and shall,
except as expressly provided or authorized, have no authority to act
for or represent the Fund or the Manager in any way or otherwise be
deemed an agent of the Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited
to research, advice and supervision for the Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or
any appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time
to time as economic conditions require, a recommended investment
program for the Fund consistent with the Series' investment
objective and policies.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders for
the purchase and sale of securities and other investment
instruments without prior consultation with the Manager and
without regard to the length of time the securities have been
held, the resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any tax
considerations, subject always to the provisions of the Fund's
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the requirements of
the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be from time to time in
effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the
officers, in taking such steps as are reasonably necessary or
appropriate to carry out the decisions of its Board of
Directors, and any appropriate committees of such Board,
regarding the general conduct of the investment business of the
Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services provided to the Series, its compliance with
the 1940 Act and the regulations adopted by the Securities and
Exchange Commission thereunder and the Series' investment
strategies and restrictions as stated in the Fund's prospectus
and statement of additional information, subject to receipt of
such additional information as may be required from the Manager
and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of this Agreement.
The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the maintenance of
Fund records except insofar as is directly related to the
services it provides to the Series.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and
in such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem
appropriate in order to enable it to determine that the
investment policies, procedures and approved investment program
of the Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of the
fair value of certain securities when reliable market quotations
are not readily available for purposes of calculating net asset
value in accordance with procedures and methods established by
the Fund's Board of Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other
personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and
(ii) administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical
personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of
its duties under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the cost of the securities or other investment instruments
purchased or sold or held by the Fund (including taxes,
brokerage commissions and other applicable transaction costs, if
any, shall be solely borne by the Fund.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission
merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect
all transactions for the Series, place all necessary orders with
broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-dealers),
and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the extent
consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the
Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell
orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event
allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as the
expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the
Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the
most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to
the Fund and to other clients.  The Manager recognizes that, in
some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the position
that may be acquired or sold for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor
will report on such allocations at the request of the Manager,
the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing such
information as the number of aggregated trades to which the
Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades were
directed and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated
trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain execution of transactions for the Series at prices
which are advantageous to the Series and at commission rates
that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.
However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the
basis that they provide brokerage, research or other services or
products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with
applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an
amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction in
excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread another
broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that
transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that
such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value
of the brokerage and research products and/or services provided
by such broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to
brokerage and research products and/or services, may be viewed
in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have
with respect to the Series as well as to accounts over which
they exercise investment discretion. Such services or products
do not need to be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the
Series. In addition, joint repurchase  accounts may not be
utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any
exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all
conditions of such order are complied with.

	The Manager acknowledges that the Sub-Advisor may have
investment responsibilities or render investment advice to, or
perform other investment advisory services for, other
individuals or entities (Affiliated Accounts).  The Manager
agrees that the Sub-Advisor may give advice or exercise
investment responsibility and take such other action with
respect to its Affiliated Accounts that may differ from advice
given or the timing or nature of action taken with respect to
the Fund, provided that the Sub-Advisor acts in good faith, and
provided, further, that it the Sub-Advisor's policy to allocate,
within its reasonable discretion, investment opportunities to
the Fund over a period of time on a fair and equitable basis
relative to the Affiliated Accounts, taking into account the
investment objectives and policies of the Fund and any specific
investment restrictions applicable thereto.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the
Series as are required of an investment advisor of a registered
investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisers Act), and the
rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such
periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may
reasonably request.  In compliance with the requirements of Rule
31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all
records that it maintains for the Series are the property of the
Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the Fund
and that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the
1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund
any records that it maintains for the Series upon request by the
Fund or the Manager; provided, however, that the Sub-Advisor may
retain a copy of such records in order to comply with applicable
requirements under the Investment Advisers Act.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as
the same may be amended from time to time.  The Manager
acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current Code of
Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to the Manager a
copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of
Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request,
furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio transactions
and reports on investments held by the Series, all in such
detail as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably request.  The
Sub-Advisor will make available its officers and employees to
meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal
place of business on due notice to review the investments of the
Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-
advisor and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to
comply with their respective obligations under applicable laws,
including, without limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment
Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and any rule
or regulation thereunder.  Sub-Advisor will advise Manager of
any changes in Sub-Advisor's senior management (i.e. Chief
Investment Officer and President) within a reasonable time after
any such change.  Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-Advisor's
Form ADV more than 48 hours prior to the execution of this
Agreement.

by, or with respect to, the issuers of securities held in the
Series.  The Manager shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor
all proxy solicitation materials that it receives and shall
assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the proxy voting
process.  In addition, the Sub-Advisor shall have the power,
discretion and responsibility to exercise and act with respect
to any conversion privilege, subscription right, or other
corporate action notification with respect to any of the assets
of the Series, as well as participate, join in or dissent from,
and vote in any in-court or out-of-court corporate restructuring
or reorganization or liquidation.

(o)	The Sub-Advisor shall have the power to make, execute,
acknowledge and deliver on behalf of the Fund any and all
documents of transfer and conveyance and any and all other
documents or instruments that may be necessary or appropriate to
carry out the powers granted to it under this Agreement.  In
