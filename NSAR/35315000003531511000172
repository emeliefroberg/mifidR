"1395","of Fidelity Municipal Income 2015 Fund, Fidelity Municipal Income 2017 Fund,"
"1396","Fidelity Municipal Income 2019 Fund and Fidelity Municipal Income 2021 Fund (the"
"1397","Funds), each a fund of Fidelity Fixed-Income Trust, as of June 30, 2011 and"
"1398","for the period May 19, 2011 (commencement of operations) to June 30, 2011, in"
"1399","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1400","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1401","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1402","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1403","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"1404","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"1405","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"1406","opinion. </P>"
"1407","<P align=left>The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1408","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"1409","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"1410","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal"
"1411","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1412","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1413","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1414","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"1415","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1416","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"1417","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1418","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1419","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1420","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"1421","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"1422","fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1423","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets"
"1424","that could have a material effect on the financial statements. </P>"
"1425","<P align=left>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1426","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"1427","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1428","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"1429","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>"
"1430","<P align=left>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1431","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1432","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"1433","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.&nbsp; A material weakness is"
"1434","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"1435","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1436","misstatement of a fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1437","prevented or detected on a timely basis. </P>"
"1438","<P align=left>Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1439","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"1440","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"1441","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1442","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"1443","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"1444","for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness, as"
"1445","defined above, as of June 30, 2011. </P>"

"2324","to buy, sell, lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities"
"2325","and investment instruments on behalf of the Portfolio. The investment policies"
"2326","and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times be subject to"

"2328","<P align=left>(b) Management Services. The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for"

"2330","necessary for the operation of the Fund. The Adviser shall, subject to the"
"2331","supervision of the Board of Trustees, perform various services for the"
"2332","Portfolio, including but not limited to: (i) providing the Portfolio with office"
"2333","space, equipment and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining its"

"2346","<P align=left>The Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations,"
"2347","information or analyses to the Fund as the Fund's Board of Trustees may request"
"2348","from time to time or as the Adviser may deem to be desirable. The Adviser shall"
"2349","make recommendations to the Fund's Board of Trustees with respect to Fund"
"2350","policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees. The"
"2351","Adviser shall, subject to review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other"
"2352","services as the Adviser shall from time to time determine to be necessary or"
"2353","useful to perform its obligations under this Contract. </P>"
"2354","<P align=left>(c) The Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale"
"2355","of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers"
"2356","selected by the Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with"
"2357","the Adviser. The Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio"
"2358","transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission"
"2359","rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. In selecting"
"2360","brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or"
"2361","dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as"
"2362","those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)"
"2363","to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Adviser or its"

"2366","for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess of"
"2367","the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"2368","effecting that transaction if the Adviser determines in good faith that such"
"2369","amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"2370","research services provided by such broker or dealer. This determination may be"
"2371","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"2372","responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to"
"2373","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Trustees of the"
"2374","Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to"

"2596","and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times be subject to"
"2597","the control and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees. </P>"
"2598","<P align=left>(b) Management Services. The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for"

"2600","necessary for the operation of the Fund. The Adviser shall, subject to the"
"2601","supervision of the Board of Trustees, perform various services for the"
"2602","Portfolio, including but not limited to: (i) providing the Portfolio with office"
"2603","space, equipment and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining its"
"2604","organization; (ii) on behalf of the Portfolio, supervising relations with, and"

"2641","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"2642","responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to"

"2847","Massachusetts corporation (hereinafter called the Adviser) as set forth in its"
"2848","entirety below. </P>"
"2849","<P align=left>1. (a) Investment Advisory Services. The Adviser undertakes to act"
"2850","as investment adviser of the Portfolio and shall, subject to the supervision of"
"2851","the Fund's Board of Trustees, direct the investments of the Portfolio in"
"2852","accordance with the investment objective, policies and limitations as provided"
"2853","in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other governing instruments, as amended from"
"2854","time to time, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and rules thereunder, as"

"2856","Portfolio may impose by notice in writing to the Adviser. The Adviser shall also"
"2857","furnish for the use of the Portfolio office space and all necessary office"
"2858","facilities, equipment and personnel for servicing the investments of the"
"2859","Portfolio; and shall pay the salaries and fees of all officers of the Fund, of"
"2860","all Trustees of the Fund who are interested persons of the Fund or of the"
"2861","Adviser and of all personnel of the Fund or the Adviser performing services"
"2862","relating to research, statistical and investment activities. The Adviser is"
"2863","authorized, in its discretion and without prior consultation with the Portfolio,"
"2864","to buy, sell, lend and otherwise trade in any stocks, bonds and other securities"
"2865","and investment instruments on behalf of the Portfolio. The investment policies"
"2866","and all other actions of the Portfolio are and shall at all times be subject to"
"2867","the control and direction of the Fund's Board of Trustees. </P>"
"2868","<P align=left>(b) Management Services. The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for"
"2869","the performance by its affiliates of) the management and administrative services"
"2870","necessary for the operation of the Fund. The Adviser shall, subject to the"
"2871","supervision of the Board of Trustees, perform various services for the"
"2872","Portfolio, including but not limited to: (i) providing the Portfolio with office"
"2873","space, equipment and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining its"
"2874","organization; (ii) on behalf of the Portfolio, supervising relations with, and"
"2875","monitoring the performance of, any custodians, depositories, transfer and"
"2876","pricing agents, accountants, attorneys, underwriters, brokers and dealers,"
"2877","insurers and other persons in any capacity deemed to be necessary or desirable;"
"2878","(iii) preparing all general shareholder communications, including shareholder"
"2879","reports; (iv) conducting shareholder relations; (v) maintaining the Fund's"
"2880","existence and its records; (vi) during such times as shares are publicly"
"2881","offered, maintaining the registration and qualification of the Portfolio's"
"2882","shares under federal and state law; and (vii) investigating the development of"
"2883","and developing and implementing, if appropriate, management and shareholder"
"2884","services designed to enhance the value or convenience of the Portfolio as an"
"2885","investment vehicle. </P>"
"2886","<P align=left>The Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations,"
"2887","information or analyses to the Fund as the Fund's Board of Trustees may request"
"2888","from time to time or as the Adviser may deem to be desirable. The Adviser shall"
"2889","make recommendations to the Fund's Board of Trustees with respect to Fund"
"2890","policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees. The"
"2891","Adviser shall, subject to review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other"
"2892","services as the Adviser shall from time to time determine to be necessary or"
"2893","useful to perform its obligations under this Contract. </P>"
"2894","<P align=left>(c) The Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale"
"2895","of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers"
"2896","selected by the Adviser, which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with"
"2897","the Adviser. The Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio"
"2898","transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission"
"2899","rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. In selecting"
"2900","brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or"
"2901","dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as"
"2902","those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)"
"2903","to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Adviser or its"
"2904","affiliates exercise investment discretion. The Adviser is authorized to pay a"
"2905","broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission"
"2906","for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess of"
"2907","the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"2908","effecting that transaction if the Adviser determines in good faith that such"
"2909","amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"2910","research services provided by such broker or dealer. This determination may be"
"2911","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"2912","responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to"
"2913","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Trustees of the"
"2914","Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to"
"2915","determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time were"
"2916","reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio. </P>"
"2917","<P id=C__\desktop\NSAR\q77q1_managementcontract2019.html.2 align=left>The"
"2918","Adviser shall, in acting hereunder, be an independent contractor. The Adviser"
"2919","shall not be an agent of the Portfolio. </P>"
"2920","<P align=left>2. It is understood that the Trustees, officers and shareholders"
"2921","of the Fund are or may be or become interested in the Adviser as directors,"
"2922","officers or otherwise and that directors, officers and stockholders of the"
"2923","Adviser are or may be or become similarly interested in the Fund, and that the"
"2924","Adviser may be or become interested in the Fund as a shareholder or otherwise."
"2925","</P>"
"2926","<P align=left>3. For the services and facilities to be furnished hereunder, the"
"2927","Adviser shall receive a monthly management fee at the annual rate of 0.30% of"
"2928","the average daily net assets of the Portfolio (computed in the manner set forth"
"2929","in the Declaration of Trust) throughout the month; provided that in the case of"
"2930","initiation or termination of this Contract during any month, the fee for that"
"2931","month shall be reduced proportionately on the basis of the number of business"
"2932","days during which it is in effect, and the fee computed upon the average net"
"2933","assets for the business days it is so in effect for that month. </P>"
"2934","<P align=left>4. The Adviser undertakes to pay all expenses involved in the"
"2935","operation of the Portfolio, including all expenses allocable at the Portfolio"
"2936","level, except the following: (i) transfer agent fees, Rule 12b-1 fees and other"
"2937","expenses allocable at the class level; (ii) interest and taxes; (iii) brokerage"
"2938","commissions and other costs in connection with the purchase or sale of"
"2939","securities and other investment instruments; (iv) fees and expenses of the"
"2940","Fund's Trustees other than those who are interested persons of the Fund or the"
"2941","Adviser; and (v) such non-recurring or extraordinary expenses as may arise,"
"2942","including those relating to actions, suits or proceedings to which the Portfolio"
"2943","is a party and the legal obligation which the Portfolio may have to indemnify"
"2944","the Fund's Trustees and officers with respect thereto. It is understood that"
"2945","service charges billed directly to shareholders of the Portfolio, including"
"2946","charges for exchanges, redemptions, or other services, shall not be payable by"
"2947","the Adviser, but may be received and retained by the Adviser or its affiliates."
"2948","It is also understood that the Adviser and/or the Portfolio may, from time to"
"2949","time, allocate or reallocate expenses between the Portfolio and any class of the"
"2950","Portfolio. </P>"
"2951","<P align=left>5. The services of the Adviser to the Portfolio are not to be"
"2952","deemed exclusive, the Adviser being free to render services to others and engage"
"2953","in other activities, provided, however, that such other services and activities"
"2954","do not, during the term of this Contract, interfere, in a material manner, with"
"2955","the Adviser's ability to meet all of its obligations with respect to rendering"
"2956","services to the Portfolio hereunder. In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad"
"2957","faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or duties hereunder"
"2958","on the part of the Adviser, the Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the"
"2959","Portfolio or to any shareholder of the Portfolio for any act or omission in the"
"2960","course of, or connected with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses"
"2961","that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security or other"
"2962","investment instrument. </P>"
"2963","<P id=C__\desktop\NSAR\q77q1_managementcontract2019.html.3 align=left>6. (a)"

"2966","indefinitely thereafter, but only so long as the continuance after such date"
"2967","shall be specifically approved at least annually by vote of the Trustees of the"
"2968","Fund or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the"
"2969","Portfolio. </P>"
"2970","<P align=left>(b) This Contract may be modified by mutual consent subject to the"
"2971","provisions of Section 15 of the 1940 Act, as modified by or interpreted by any"
"2972","applicable order or orders of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"

"3137","<P align=left>(b) Management Services. The Adviser shall perform (or arrange for"
"3138","the performance by its affiliates of) the management and administrative services"
"3139","necessary for the operation of the Fund. The Adviser shall, subject to the"
"3140","supervision of the Board of Trustees, perform various services for the"
"3141","Portfolio, including but not limited to: (i) providing the Portfolio with office"
"3142","space, equipment and facilities (which may be its own) for maintaining its"

"3157","from time to time or as the Adviser may deem to be desirable. The Adviser shall"
"3158","make recommendations to the Fund's Board of Trustees with respect to Fund"
"3159","policies, and shall carry out such policies as are adopted by the Trustees. The"

"3163","<P align=left>(c) The Adviser shall place all orders for the purchase and sale"
"3164","of portfolio securities for the Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers"

"3166","the Adviser. The Adviser shall use its best efforts to seek to execute portfolio"
"3167","transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio and at commission"
"3168","rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits received. In selecting"
"3169","brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or"
"3170","dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as"
"3171","those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)"
"3172","to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which the Adviser or its"

"3175","for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess of"
"3176","the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"3177","effecting that transaction if the Adviser determines in good faith that such"

"3179","research services provided by such broker or dealer. This determination may be"
"3180","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall"
"3181","responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to"
"3182","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Trustees of the"
"3183","Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to"

"3186","<P id=C__\desktop\NSAR\q77q1_managementcontract2021.html.2 align=left>The"

"3198","in the Declaration of Trust) throughout the month; provided that in the case of"
"3199","initiation or termination of this Contract during any month, the fee for that"
"3200","month shall be reduced proportionately on the basis of the number of business"
"3201","days during which it is in effect, and the fee computed upon the average net"
"3202","assets for the business days it is so in effect for that month. </P>"
"3203","<P align=left>4. The Adviser undertakes to pay all expenses involved in the"
"3204","operation of the Portfolio, including all expenses allocable at the Portfolio"
"3205","level, except the following: (i) transfer agent fees, Rule 12b-1 fees and other"
"3206","expenses allocable at the class level; (ii) interest and taxes; (iii) brokerage"

"3208","securities and other investment instruments; (iv) fees and expenses of the"
"3209","Fund's Trustees other than those who are interested persons of the Fund or the"
"3210","Adviser; and (v) such non-recurring or extraordinary expenses as may arise,"
"3211","including those relating to actions, suits or proceedings to which the Portfolio"
"3212","is a party and the legal obligation which the Portfolio may have to indemnify"
"3213","the Fund's Trustees and officers with respect thereto. It is understood that"
"3214","service charges billed directly to shareholders of the Portfolio, including"
"3215","charges for exchanges, redemptions, or other services, shall not be payable by"
"3216","the Adviser, but may be received and retained by the Adviser or its affiliates."
"3217","It is also understood that the Adviser and/or the Portfolio may, from time to"

"3223","do not, during the term of this Contract, interfere, in a material manner, with"

"3227","on the part of the Adviser, the Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the"
"3228","Portfolio or to any shareholder of the Portfolio for any act or omission in the"

"3855","policies and limitations as provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other"
"3856","governing instruments, as amended from time to time, the Investment Company Act"

"3860","the Portfolio office space and all necessary office facilities, equipment and"
"3861","personnel for servicing the investments of the Portfolio; and shall pay the"
"3862","salaries and fees of all personnel of the Sub-Adviser performing services for"
"3863","the Portfolio relating to research, statistical and investment activities. The"

"3865","the Portfolio or the Adviser, to buy, sell, lend and otherwise trade in any"
"3866","stocks, bonds and other securities and investment instruments on behalf of the"

"3875","policies as are adopted by the Trustees. The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to"
"3876","review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Sub-Adviser"

"3885","Portfolio and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the"
"3886","benefits received. In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a"
"3887","particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide"
"3888","brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of"
"3889","the Securities Exchange Act of l934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts"
"3890","over which the Sub-Adviser, Adviser or their affiliates exercise investment"
"3891","discretion. The Sub-Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides"
"3892","such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio"
"3893","transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess of the amount of commission"
"3894","another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if"
"3895","the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is"
"3896","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services"
"3897","provided by such broker or dealer. This determination may be viewed in terms of"
"3898","either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the"
"3899","Sub-Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they"
"3900","exercise investment discretion. The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically"
"3901","review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the commissions"
"3902","paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the"
"3903","benefits to the Portfolio. </P>"
"3904","<P id=C__\desktop\NSAR\q77q1_subadvisoryagreement2019.html.2 align=left>2. As"

"3908","Portfolio's Management Contract with the Adviser in respect of that portion of"
"3909","the Portfolio's assets managed by the Sub-Adviser during such month. Such fee"

"3912","<P align=left>3. It is understood that Trustees, officers, and shareholders of"
"3913","the Fund are or may be or become interested in the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser as"

"4080","as the Adviser shall designate in accordance with the investment objective,"
"4081","policies and limitations as provided in the Portfolio's Prospectus or other"
"4082","governing instruments, as amended from time to time, the Investment Company Act"
"4083","of l940 and rules thereunder, as amended from time to time (the l940 Act),"
"4084","and such other limitations as the Portfolio may impose by notice in writing to"
"4085","the Adviser or Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish for the use of"
"4086","the Portfolio office space and all necessary office facilities, equipment and"
"4087","personnel for servicing the investments of the Portfolio; and shall pay the"
"4088","salaries and fees of all personnel of the Sub-Adviser performing services for"
"4089","the Portfolio relating to research, statistical and investment activities. The"

"4095","Board of Trustees. </P>"
"4096","<P align=left>(b) The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish such reports, evaluations,"

"4098","Trustees or the Adviser may request from time to time or as the Sub-Adviser may"
"4099","deem to be desirable. The Sub-Adviser shall make recommendations to the Fund's"
"4100","Board of Trustees with respect to Portfolio policies, and shall carry out such"
"4101","policies as are adopted by the Trustees. The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to"
"4102","review by the Board of Trustees, furnish such other services as the Sub-Adviser"

"4115","the Securities Exchange Act of l934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts"

"4118","such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio"
"4119","transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess of the amount of commission"
"4120","another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if"
"4121","the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such amount of commission is"
"4122","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services"
"4123","provided by such broker or dealer. This determination may be viewed in terms of"
"4124","either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the"
"4125","Sub-Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they"
"4126","exercise investment discretion. The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically"
"4127","review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the commissions"
"4128","paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the"
"4129","benefits to the Portfolio. </P>"
"4130","<P id=C__\desktop\NSAR\q77q1_subadvisoryagreement2021.html.2 align=left>2. As"

"4132","Adviser agrees to pay the Sub-Adviser a monthly fee equal to 50% of the"
"4133","management fee which the Portfolio is obligated to pay the Adviser under the"
"4134","Portfolio's Management Contract with the Adviser in respect of that portion of"
