<DESCRIPTION>ADVISORY AGREEMENT
<TEXT>

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED
                          INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

     This AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT is made as of this 6th day of August
2003, and amended as of October 1, 2005 and March 27, 2009, between Wells Fargo
Funds Trust (the Trust), a statutory trust organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware with its principal place of business at 525 Market Street,
12th Floor, San Francisco, California, 94105 and Wells Fargo Funds Management,
LLC (the Adviser), a limited liability company organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware with its principal place of business at 525 Market Street,
12th Floor, San Francisco, California, 94105.

     WHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the 1940 Act) as an open-end management investment company and is
authorized to issue interests (as defined in the Trust's Declaration of Trust,
as amended and supplemented from time to time), in separate series; and

     WHEREAS, the Trust desires that the Adviser provide investment advisory
services to each series of the Trust listed on Schedule A hereto as such
Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to time by mutual agreement
(each a Fund and collectively the Funds), and the Adviser is willing to
provide those services on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;

     NOW THEREFORE, the Trust and the Adviser agree as follows:

     SECTION 1. APPOINTMENT OF THE ADVISER. The Trust is engaged in the business
of investing and reinvesting its assets in securities of the type and in
accordance with the limitations specified in its Declaration of Trust, as
amended and supplemented from time to time, By-Laws (if any) and Registration
Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission)
under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act),
including any representations made in the prospectus and statement of additional
information relating to the Funds contained therein and as may be amended or
supplemented from time to time, all in such manner and to such extent as may
from time to time be authorized by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the Board).
The Board is authorized to issue any unissued shares in any number of additional
classes or series.

     The investment authority granted to the Adviser shall include the authority
to exercise whatever powers the Trust may possess with respect to any of its
assets held by the Funds, including, but not limited to, the power to exercise
rights, options, warrants, conversion privileges, redemption privileges, and to
tender securities pursuant to a tender offer, and participate in class actions
and other legal proceedings on behalf of the Funds.

     The Trust hereby employs Adviser, subject to the direction and control of
the Board, to manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets in the Funds
and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to provide the other
services specified in Section 2 hereof.

<PAGE>

     SECTION 2. DUTIES OF THE ADVISER.

     (a) The Adviser shall make decisions with respect to all purchases and
sales of securities and other investment assets for the Funds. Among other
things, the Adviser shall make all decisions with respect to the allocation of
the Funds' investments in various securities or other assets, in investment
styles and, if applicable, in other investment companies or pooled vehicles in
which a Fund may invest. To carry out such decisions, the Adviser is hereby
authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact for the Trust, for the account of, at
the risk of and in the name of the Trust, to place orders and issue instructions
with respect to those transactions of the Funds. In all purchases, sales and
other transactions in securities for the Funds, the Adviser is authorized to
exercise full discretion and act for the Trust in the same manner and with the
same force and effect as the Trust might or could do with respect to such
purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as with respect to all other
things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or conduct of such purchases,
sales or other transactions.

     (b) The Adviser will report to the Board at each regular meeting thereof
regarding the investment performance of the Funds since the prior report, and
will also keep the Board informed of important developments affecting the Trust,
each Fund and the Adviser, and on its own initiative will furnish the Board from
time to time with such information as the Adviser may believe appropriate,
whether concerning the individual companies whose securities are held by a Fund,
the industries in which they engage, or the economic, social or political
conditions prevailing in each country in which a Fund maintains investments. The
Adviser will also furnish the Board with such statistical and analytical
information with respect to securities in the Funds as the Adviser may believe
appropriate or as the Board reasonably may request.

          The Adviser shall promptly notify the Trust of (i) any changes
regarding the Adviser that would impact disclosure in the Trust's Registration
Statement, or (ii) any violation of any requirement, provision, policy or
restriction that the Adviser is required to comply with under Section 6 of this
Agreement. The Adviser shall immediately notify the Trust of any legal process
served upon it in connection with its activities hereunder, including any legal
process served upon it on behalf of the Funds or the Trust.

     (c) The Adviser will from time to time employ or sub-contract the services
to certain persons as the Adviser believes to be appropriate or necessary to
assist in the execution of the Adviser's duties hereunder; provided, however,
that the employment or sub-contracting with any such person shall not relieve
the Adviser of its responsibilities or liabilities hereunder and provided
further that the Adviser shall not have the authority to sub-contract advisory
responsibilities without the consent of the Trust. The cost of performance of
such duties will be borne and paid by the Adviser. No obligation may be imposed
on the Trust in any such respect.

          The Adviser shall supervise and monitor the activities of its
representatives, personnel, sub-contractors, and agents in connection with the
execution of its duties and obligations hereunder. The appropriate personnel of
the Adviser will be made available to consult with the Board at reasonable times
and upon reasonable notice concerning the business of the Trust.


                                       2

<PAGE>

     (d) The Adviser shall maintain records relating to portfolio transactions
and the placing and allocation of brokerage orders as are required to be
maintained by the Trust under the 1940 Act. The Adviser shall prepare and
maintain, or cause to be prepared and maintained, in such form, for such periods
and in such locations as may be required by applicable law, all documents and
records relating to the services provided by the Adviser pursuant to this
Agreement required to be prepared and maintained by the Trust pursuant to the
rules and regulations of any national, state, or local government entity with
jurisdiction over the Trust, including the Commission and the Internal Revenue
Service. The books and records pertaining to the Trust which are in possession
of the Adviser shall be the property of the Trust. The Trust, or the Trust's
authorized representatives, shall have access to such books and records at all
times during the Adviser's normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of
the Trust, copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by
the Adviser to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives.

     (e) With respect to a Fund, the Adviser shall have no duties or obligations
pursuant to this Agreement, during any period during which the Fund invests all
(or substantially all) of its investment assets in a registered, open-end
management investment company, or separate series thereof, in accordance with
Section 12(d)(1)(E) under the 1940 Act.

     SECTION 3. DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO THE ADVISER. The Trust has furnished
the Adviser with true, correct and complete copies of the following documents:

          (a)  The Declaration of Trust, as in effect on the date hereof;

          (b)  The Registration Statement filed with the Commission under the
               1940 Act and the Securities Act; and

          (c)  Written guidelines, policies and procedures adopted by the Trust.

     The Trust will furnish the Adviser with all future amendments and
supplements to the foregoing as soon as practicable after such documents become
available. The Trust shall furnish the Adviser with any further documents,
materials or information that the Adviser may reasonably request in connection
with the performance of its duties hereunder.

     SECTION 4. DELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES. The Adviser may carry out any of
its obligations under this Agreement by employing, subject to supervision by the
Adviser, one or more Sub-Adviser(s) who are registered as investment advisers
pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Sub-Advisers). Each
Sub-Adviser's employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement
approved by the Board and, if required under the 1940 Act, by the shareholders
of the Fund (unless the Commission or its staff has given authorization or
issued an interpretation dispensing with the requirement of shareholder
approval). The Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any act or omission of
any Sub-Adviser, except for failure to exercise good faith in the employment of
the Sub-Adviser and for failure to exercise appropriate supervision of such
Sub-Adviser, and as may otherwise be agreed in writing. The Adviser shall be
solely responsible for compensating any Sub-Adviser for services rendered under
any Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Adviser may, from time to time and at any time,
terminate any Sub-Adviser and reassume the responsibilities assigned to such
Sub-Adviser with respect to any Fund without obtaining the approval of the
shareholders of the Fund.


                                       3

<PAGE>

     SECTION 5. CONTROL BY BOARD. Any investment activities undertaken by the
Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken
by the Adviser on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be subject to the
direction and control of the Board.

     SECTION 6. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS. In carrying out its
obligations under this Agreement, the Adviser shall at all times comply with:

     (a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and
regulations adopted thereunder;

     (b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be amended from time
to time, filed with the Commission under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;

     (c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it may be
amended from time to time;

     (d) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to the Trust or the Funds, and any rules and regulations adopted
thereunder; and

     (e)any other applicable provisions of state or federal law, and any rules
and regulations adopted thereunder.

     SECTION 7. PROXIES. The Adviser shall have responsibility to vote proxies
solicited with respect to issuers of securities in which assets of the Funds are
invested in accordance with the Trust's policies on proxy voting.

     SECTION 8. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. In connection with the purchase and
sale of securities for the Funds, the Adviser is responsible for broker-dealer
selection and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Adviser's primary
consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best
price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular
transaction for a Fund, the Adviser will consider among other things: the best
net price available, the reliability, integrity and financial condition of the
broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value
of the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing
basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less
favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is
reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services
offered. Subject to such policies as the Board may from time to time determine,
the Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any
duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a
Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to
the Adviser an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment
transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would
have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Adviser determines in good
faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of
the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in
terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of
the Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the


                                       4

<PAGE>

Adviser. The Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed by it
on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide brokerage and
research services within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be in such
amounts and proportions as the Adviser shall determine and the Adviser will
report on said allocations regularly to the Board, indicating the brokers to
whom such allocations have been made and the basis therefore.

     SECTION 9. EXPENSES. All of the ordinary business expenses incurred in the
operations of the Funds and the offering of their shares shall be borne by the
Funds unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses
borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions,
taxes, legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost of preparing share
certificates, custodian, transfer agent and shareholder service agent costs,
expense of issue, sale, redemption and repurchase of shares, expenses of
registering and qualifying shares for sale, expenses relating to trustees and
shareholder meetings, the cost of preparing and distributing reports and notices
to shareholders, the fees and other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection
with membership in investment company organizations and the cost of printing
copies of prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to
the Funds' shareholders.

     The Adviser shall pay its own expenses in connection with the services to
be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, the Adviser shall be
responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the
Trust: (a) to amend the Trust's registration statement or supplement the Fund's
prospectus, and circulate the same, to reflect a change in the personnel of the
Adviser responsible for making investment decisions in relation to a Fund; (b)
to obtain shareholder approval of a new sub-advisory agreement as a result of a
change in control (as such term in defined in Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act)
of the Adviser, or to otherwise comply with the 1940 Act, the Securities Act, or
any other applicable statute, law, rule or regulation, as a result of such
change; or (c) to meet other legal or regulatory obligations caused by actions
of the Adviser.

     SECTION 10. COMPENSATION.

     (a) As compensation for the advisory services provided under this
Agreement, the Trust shall pay the Adviser fees, payable monthly, at the annual
rates indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule may be amended or
supplemented from time to time;

     (b) Except as provided in the following paragraph, no fee shall be payable
hereunder with respect to a Fund during any period in which the Fund invests all
(or substantially all) of its investment assets in a single registered, open-end
management investment company, or separate series thereof, in accordance with
Section 12(d)(1)(E) under the 1940 Act (a Master-Feeder Fund structure);

     (c) The adviser shall receive a fee of 0.25% (0.35% in the case of the
WealthBuilder Funds) for asset allocation services if a Fund invests some of its
investment assets in two or more registered, open-end management investment
companies, or separate series thereof, in each case, in accordance with Section
12(d)(1)(G) under the Act, the rules thereunder or an exemptive order

<PAGE>

issued by the Commission exempting the Fund from the provisions of Section
12(d)(1)(A) under the Act (a Fund of Funds structure).

     SECTION 11. STANDARD OF CARE. The Trust will expect of the Adviser, and the
Adviser will give the Trust the benefit of, the Adviser's best judgment and
efforts in rendering its services to the Trust, and the Adviser shall not be
liable hereunder for any mistake in judgment. In the absence of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or
duties hereunder on the part of the Adviser or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents, the Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Trust
or to any shareholders of the Trust for any act or omission in the course of, or
connected with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be
sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security.

     SECTION 12. NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The services of the Adviser to the Funds are
not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Adviser shall be free to render
investment advisory or other services to others (including other investment
companies) and to engage in other activities. It is understood and agreed that
officers or directors of the Adviser may serve as officers and directors of the
Trust, and that officers or directors of the Trust may serve as officers or
directors of the Adviser, to the extent that such services may be permitted by
law, and that the officers and directors of the Adviser are not prohibited from
engaging in any other business activity or from rendering services to any other
person, or from serving as partners, officers, directors or trustees of any
other firm or trust, including other investment advisory companies.

or arrange for the maintenance of the documents and records required pursuant to
Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act as well as such records as the Funds'
administrator reasonably requests to be maintained, including, but not limited
to, trade tickets and confirmations for portfolio trades. All such records shall
be maintained in a form acceptable to the Trust and in compliance with the
provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any successor rule. All such records will be the
property of the Trust and will be made available for inspection and use by the
Trust and its authorized representatives.

Act) of a party to this Agreement (other than as Trustees of the Trust), by
votes cast in person at a meeting specifically called for such purpose.


                                       6

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

pursuant to the 1940 Act. In addition, where the effect of a requirement of the
1940 Act reflected in any provision of this Agreement is revised by rule,
regulation or order of the Commission, such provision shall be deemed to
incorporate the effect of such rule, regulation or order. The duties and
obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall be governed by and

another registered investment company not advised by the Adviser or one of its
affiliates; and (iv) in the event that the Adviser or an affiliate thereof is no
longer acting as investment adviser to any Fund, the Trust shall, upon request
by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be necessary to change its

                             SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT
                        BETWEEN WELLS FARGO FUNDS TRUST,
                      WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, LLC AND
                           GLOBAL INDEX ADVISORS, INC.

     This AGREEMENT is made as of this 26th day of June, 2006, between Wells
Fargo Funds Trust (the Trust), a statutory trust organized under the laws of
the State of Delaware with its principal place of business at 525 Market Street,
12th Floor, San Francisco, California 94105, Wells Fargo Funds Management, LLC
(the Adviser), a limited liability company organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware with its principal place of business at 525 Market Street,
12th Floor, San Francisco, California 94105, and Global Index Advisors, Inc.
(the Sub-Adviser), a corporation organized under the laws of the State of
Alabama, with its principal place of business at 2964 Peachtree Road, Suite 542,
Atlanta, GA 30305.

     WHEREAS, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser are registered investment advisers
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act); and

     WHEREAS, the Trust is engaged in business as an open-end investment company
with one or more series of shares and is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act); and

     WHEREAS, the Trust's Board of Trustees (the Board) has engaged the
Adviser to perform investment advisory services for each series of the Trust
under the terms of an investment advisory agreement, dated August 6, 2003,
between the Adviser and the Trust (the Advisory Agreement); and

     WHEREAS, the Adviser, acting pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, wishes to
retain the Sub-Adviser, and the Trust's Board has approved the retention of the
Sub-Adviser, to provide investment advisory services to each series of the Trust
listed in Appendix A hereto as it may be amended from time to time (each a
Fund and collectively the Funds), and the Sub-Adviser is willing to provide
those services on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;

     NOW THEREFORE, the Trust, the Adviser and Sub-Adviser agree as follows:

     SECTION 1. APPOINTMENT OF SUB-ADVISER. The Trust is engaged in the business
of investing and reinvesting its assets in securities of the type and in
accordance with the limitations specified in its Declaration of Trust, as
amended or supplemented from time to time, By-Laws (if any) and Registration
Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission)
under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act),
including any representations made in the prospectus and statement of additional
information relating to the Funds contained therein and as may be amended or
supplemented from time to time, all in such manner and to such extent as may
from time to time be authorized by the Board.

     Subject to the direction and control of the Board, the Adviser manages the
investment and reinvestment of the assets of the Funds and provides for certain
management and other services as specified in the Advisory Agreement.


                                       1

<PAGE>

     Subject to the direction and control of the Board and the Adviser, the
Sub-Adviser shall manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the
Funds as contemplated in this Agreement, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, shall provide the management and other services specified below
in Section 2(a), all in such manner and to such extent as may be directed from
time to time by the Adviser. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Adviser shall be responsible for compliance with any statute,
rule, regulation, guideline or investment restriction that applies to the Funds'
investment portfolio as a whole and the Sub-Adviser's responsibility shall be
limited to following any instruction the Sub-Adviser might receive from the
Adviser.

     The investment authority granted to the Sub-Adviser shall include the
authority to exercise whatever powers the Trust may possess with respect to any
of its assets held by the Funds, including, but not limited to, the power to
exercise rights, options, warrants, conversion privileges, redemption
privileges, and to tender securities pursuant to a tender offer. The Sub-Adviser
shall not, however, be responsible for voting proxies, for participating in
class actions and/or other legal proceedings on behalf of the Funds, but will
provide such assistance as is reasonably requested by the Adviser.

     SECTION 2. DUTIES OF THE SUB-ADVISER.

     (a) The Sub-Adviser shall make decisions with respect to all purchases and
sales of securities and other investment assets for the Funds. To carry out such
decisions, the Sub-Adviser is hereby authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact
for the Trust, for the account of, at the risk of and in the name of the Trust,
to place orders and issue instructions with respect to those transactions of the
Funds. In all purchases, sales and other transactions in securities and other
assets for the Funds, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to exercise full discretion
and act for the Trust and instruct the Fund's custodian (the Custodian) in the
same manner and with the same force and effect as the Trust might or could do
with respect to such purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as with
respect to all other things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or
conduct of such purchases, sales or other transactions.

     The Sub-Adviser acknowledges that the Funds and other mutual funds advised
by the Adviser (collectively, the fund complex) may engage in transactions
with certain sub-advisers in the fund complex (and their affiliated persons) in
reliance on exemptions under Rule 10f-3, Rule 12d3-1, Rule 17a-10 and Rule 17e-1
under the 1940 Act. Accordingly, the Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that it will not
consult with any other sub-adviser of a fund in the fund complex, or an
affiliated person of a sub-adviser, concerning transactions for a fund in
securities or other fund assets. With respect to a multi-managed Fund, the
Sub-Adviser shall be limited to managing only the discrete portion of the Fund's
portfolio as may be determined from time-to-time by the Board or the Adviser,
and shall not consult with the sub-adviser as to any other portion of the Fund's
portfolio concerning transactions for the Fund in securities or other Fund
assets. The foregoing is in no way intended to limit the Sub-Adviser from
serving fully in its capacity as administrator to the Dow Jones Target Date
Indexes.


                                       2

<PAGE>

     (b) Following the close of each calendar quarter, the Sub-Adviser will
report to the Board regarding the investment performance of the Fund since the
prior report, and will also keep the Board informed of important developments
known by it to affect the Trust, the Fund and the Sub-Adviser, and on its own
initiative will furnish the Board and the Adviser from time to time with such
information as the Sub-Adviser may believe appropriate, whether concerning the
individual companies whose securities are held by a Fund, the industries in
which they engage, or the economic, social or political conditions prevailing in
each country in which the Fund maintains investments. The Sub-Adviser will also
furnish the Board and the Adviser with such statistical and analytical
information with respect to securities held by the Fund as the Sub-Adviser may
believe appropriate or as the Board or the Adviser reasonably request.

     The Sub-Adviser shall promptly notify the Adviser of (i) any changes
regarding the Sub-Adviser that would impact disclosure in the Trust's
Registration Statement, or (ii) any violation of any requirement, provision,
policy or restriction that the Sub-Adviser is required to comply with under
Section 6 of this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser shall, within two business days,
notify both the Adviser and the Trust of any legal process served upon it in
connection with its activities hereunder, including any legal process served
upon it on behalf of the Adviser, the Fund or the Trust. The Sub-Adviser shall
reasonably cooperate with the Custodian in the Custodian's processing of class
actions or other legal proceedings relating to the holdings (historical and/or
current) of the Fund.

     (c) The Sub-Adviser may from time to time employ or sub-contract the
services of certain persons as the Sub-Adviser believes to be appropriate or
necessary to assist in the execution of the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder;
provided, however, that the employment of or sub-contracting to any such person
shall not relieve the Sub-Adviser of its responsibilities or liabilities
hereunder. The cost of performance of such duties shall be borne and paid by the
Sub-Adviser. No obligation may be imposed on the Trust in any such respect.

     The Sub-Adviser shall supervise and monitor the activities of its
representatives, personnel and agents in connection with the execution of its
duties and obligations hereunder. The appropriate personnel of the Sub-Adviser
will be made available to consult with the Adviser, the Trust and the Board at
reasonable times and upon reasonable notice concerning the business of the
Trust.

     (d) The Sub-Adviser shall maintain records relating to portfolio
transactions and the placing and allocation of brokerage orders as are required
to be maintained by the Trust under the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser shall prepare
and maintain, or cause to be prepared and maintained, in such form, for such
periods and in such locations as may be required by applicable law, all
documents and records relating to the services provided by the Sub-Adviser
pursuant to this Agreement required to be prepared and maintained by the Trust
pursuant to the rules and regulations of any national, state, or local
government entity with jurisdiction over the Trust, including the Commission and
the Internal Revenue Service. The books and records pertaining to the Trust
which are in possession of the Sub-Adviser shall be the property of the Trust.
The Trust, or the Trust's authorized representatives (including the Adviser),
shall have access to such books and records at all times during the
Sub-Adviser's normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of the Trust,
copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by the
Sub-Adviser to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives.

supplements to the foregoing as soon as practicable after such documents become
available. The Adviser shall furnish the Sub-Adviser with any further documents,
materials or information that the Sub-Adviser may reasonably request in
connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.

     In addition, the Sub-Adviser will furnish the Adviser with (i) a summary of
the results of any future examination of the Sub-Adviser by the Commission or
other regulatory agency with respect to the Sub-Adviser's activities hereunder;

     The Sub-Adviser will furnish the Adviser with all such documents as soon as

documents have been changed materially. The Sub-Adviser shall furnish the
Adviser with any further documents, materials or information as the Adviser may
reasonably request in connection with Sub-Adviser's performance of its duties
under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, information regarding the
Sub-Adviser's financial condition, level of insurance coverage and any

     SECTION 7. PROXIES. The Adviser shall have responsibility to vote proxies

     SECTION 8. EXPENSES. All of the ordinary business expenses incurred in the
operations of the Fund and the offering of its shares shall be borne by the Fund
unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses borne by

<PAGE>

copies of prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to
the Fund's shareholders.

     The Sub-Adviser shall pay its own expenses in connection with the services
to be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, the Sub-Adviser
shall be responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
the Adviser or the Trust: (a) to amend the Trust's registration statement (other
than as part of a normal annual updating of the registration statement) or
supplement the Fund's prospectus, and circulate the same, solely to reflect a
change in the personnel of the Sub-Adviser responsible for making investment
decisions in relation to the Fund; or (b) to obtain shareholder approval of a
new sub-advisory agreement as a result of a change in control (as such term in
defined in Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act) of the Sub-Adviser, or to otherwise
comply with the 1940 Act, the Securities Act, or any other applicable statute,
law, rule or regulation, as a result of such change.

     SECTION 9. COMPENSATION. As compensation for the sub-advisory services
provided under this Agreement, the Adviser shall pay the Sub-Adviser fees,
payable monthly, at the annual rates indicated on Appendix B hereto, as such
Schedule may be amended or supplemented as agreed to in writing by the parties
from time to time. It is understood that the Adviser shall be responsible for
the Sub-Adviser's fee for its services hereunder, and the Sub-Adviser agrees
that it shall have no claim against the Trust or the Fund with respect to
compensation under this Agreement.

     SECTION 10. STANDARD OF CARE. The Trust and the Adviser will expect of the
Sub-Adviser, and the Sub-Adviser will give the Trust and the Adviser the benefit
of, the Sub-Adviser's best judgment and efforts in rendering its services to the
Trust, and the Sub-Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any mistake in
judgment. In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or
reckless disregard of obligations or duties hereunder on the part of the
Sub-Adviser or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents, the
Sub-Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Adviser, to the Trust or to
any shareholders in the Trust for any act or omission in the course of, or
connected with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be
sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security.

     Nothing in this Agreement (including Sections 10, 15 or 16) shall be
construed to relieve either the Sub-Adviser or the Adviser of any claims or
liability arising under federal securities laws or any non-waivable provisions
of any other federal or state laws.

     SECTION 11. NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The services of the Sub-Adviser to the Adviser
and the Trust are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Sub-Adviser shall be
free to render investment advisory and administrative or other services to
others (including other investment companies) and to engage in other activities.
It is understood and agreed that officers or directors of the Sub-Adviser are
not prohibited from engaging in any other business activity or from rendering
services to any other person, or from serving as partners, officers, directors
or trustees of any other firm or trust, including other investment advisory
companies.

     It is understood that the Sub-Adviser performs investment advisory services
for various clients, including accounts of clients in which the Sub-Adviser or
associated persons have a


                                       6

<PAGE>

beneficial interest. The Sub-Adviser may give advice and take action in the
performance of its duties with respect to any of its other clients, which may
differ from the advice given, or the timing or nature of action taken, with
respect to the assets of the Fund. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
impose upon the Sub-Adviser any obligation to purchase or sell for the Fund any
security or other property that the Sub-Adviser purchases or sells for its own
accounts or for the account of any other client.

     SECTION 12. RECORDS. The Sub-Adviser shall, with respect to orders the
Sub-Adviser places for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities of the
Fund, maintain or arrange for the maintenance of the documents and records
required pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, as well as trade tickets and
confirmations of portfolio trades, and such other records as the Adviser
reasonably requests to be maintained. All such records shall be maintained in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Adviser and the Trust and in compliance with
the provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any successor rule. All such records will be the
property of the Trust, and will be made available for inspection by the Trust
and its authorized representatives (including the Adviser). The Sub-Adviser
shall promptly, upon the Trust's request, surrender to the Trust those records
that are the property of the Trust or the Fund; provided, however, that the
Sub-Adviser may retain copies of such records.

     SECTION 13. TERM AND APPROVAL. This Agreement shall become effective with
respect to a Fund after it is approved in accordance with the express
requirements of the 1940 Act, and executed by the Trust, Adviser and Sub-Adviser
and shall thereafter continue from year to year, provided that the continuation
of the Agreement is approved in accordance with the requirements of the 1940
Act, which currently requires that the continuation be approved at least

<PAGE>

provision of the 1940 Act shall be resolved by reference to such terms or
provision of the 1940 Act and to interpretations thereof, if any, by the United
States Courts or in the absence of any controlling decision of any such court,
by rules, regulations or orders of the Commission, or interpretations of the

rule, regulation or order of the Commission, such provision shall be deemed to
incorporate the effect of such rule, regulation or order. The duties and

the name of any series or class, or all of the above, and for no other purpose;
(ii) it will not grant to any third party the right to use the name Wells"

Adviser may use or grant to others the right to use the words Wells Fargo, or
any combination or abbreviation thereof, as all or a portion of a corporate or

another registered investment company not advised by the Adviser or one of its
affiliates; and (iv) in the event that the Adviser or an affiliate thereof is no
longer acting as investment adviser to the Fund, the Trust shall, upon request
by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be necessary to change its
corporate name to one not containing the words Wells Fargo and following such
change, shall not use the words Wells Fargo, or any combination thereof, as a
part of its corporate name or for any other commercial purpose, and shall use
its best efforts to cause its trustees, officers and shareholders to take any
and all actions that the Adviser may request to effect the foregoing and to
reconvey to the Adviser any and all rights to such words. The Sub-Adviser may
include the Wells Fargo Funds in its representative client list.

various market, currency, economic and business risks, and that those investment
decisions will not always be profitable. The Sub-Adviser will only be
responsible for providing the advisory services specified in Section 2(a) above.
