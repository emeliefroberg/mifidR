"553","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"554","Accounting Firm"
"555","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"556","Credit Suisse Trust Commodity Return Strategy"
"557","Portfolio:"
"558","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"559","financial statements of Credit Suisse Trust"
"560","Commodity Return Strategy Portfolio (the"
"561","Portfolio) as of and for the year ended"
"562","December 31, 2016, in accordance with the"
"563","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"564","Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"565","the Portfolio's internal control over financial"
"566","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"567","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"568","procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"569","opinion on the financial statements and to"
"570","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"571","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"572","on the effectiveness of the Portfolio's internal"
"573","control over financial reporting. Accordingly,"
"574","we express no such opinion."
"575","Management of the Portfolio is responsible for"
"576","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"577","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"578","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"579","management are required to assess the expected"
"580","benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"581","portfolio's internal control over financial"
"582","reporting is a process designed to provide"
"583","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"584","financial reporting and the preparation of"
"585","financial statements for external purposes in"
"586","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"587","principles.  A portfolio's internal control over"
"588","financial reporting includes those policies and"
"589","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"590","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"591","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"592","the assets of the portfolio; (2) provide"
"593","reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"594","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"595","financial statements in accordance with"
"596","generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"597","that receipts and expenditures of the portfolio"
"598","are being made only in accordance with"
"599","authorizations of management and trustees of"
"600","the portfolio; and (3) provide reasonable"
"601","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"602","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"603","disposition of the portfolio's assets that could"
"604","have a material effect on the financial"
"605","statements."
"606","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"607","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"608","or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"609","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"610","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"611","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"612","that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"613","or procedures may deteriorate."
"614","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"615","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"616","a control does not allow management or"
"617","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"618","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"619","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"620","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"621","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"622","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"623","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"624","Portfolio's annual or interim financial"
"625","statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"626","a timely basis."
"627","Our consideration of the Portfolio's internal"
"628","control over financial reporting was for the"
"629","limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"630","and would not necessarily disclose all"
"631","deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"632","material weaknesses under standards established"
"633","by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"634","Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"635","deficiencies in the Portfolio's internal control"
"636","over financial reporting and their operation,"
"637","including controls over safeguarding securities"
"638","that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"639","defined above as of December 31, 2016."
"640","This report is intended solely for the"
"641","information and use of management and the"
"642","Board of Trustees of Credit Suisse Trust"
"643","Commodity Return Strategy Portfolio and the"
"644","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"645","intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"646","other than these specified parties."

"929","brokers or dealers and negotiating any brokerage commission"
"930","rates, the Manager will use its best efforts to seek the best"
"931","overall terms available.  In assessing the best overall terms"
"932","available for any portfolio transaction, the Manager will"
"933","consider all factors it deems relevant including, but not limited"
"934","to, breadth of the market in the security, the price of the"
"935","security, the financial condition and execution capability of"
"936","the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of any commission"
"937","for the specific transaction and for transactions executed"
"938","through the broker or dealer in the aggregate.  In selecting"
"939","brokers or dealers to execute a particular transaction and in"
"940","evaluating the best overall terms available, the Manager may"
"941","consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms"
"942","are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of"
"943","1934, as the same may from time to time be amended)"
"944","provided to each Fund and/or other accounts over which the"
"945","Manager or an affiliate exercises investment discretion."

"952","5.                          Standard of Care"
"953","           The Manager shall exercise its best judgment in"
"954","rendering the services listed in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above."
"955","The Manager shall not be liable for any error of judgment or"
"956","mistake of law or for any loss suffered by any Fund in"
"957","connection with the matters to which this agreement"
"958","(Agreement) relates, provided that nothing herein shall be"
"959","deemed to protect or purport to protect the Manager against"
"960","any liability to each Fund or to shareholders of such Fund to"
"961","which the Manager would otherwise be subject by reason of"
"962","willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in"
"963","the performance of its duties or by reason of the Manager's"
"964","reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this"

"971","Fund's average daily net assets.  The fee shall be calculated"

"973","           The fee for the period from the date of this"
"974","Agreement to the end of the year shall be prorated according"
"975","to the proportion that such period bears to the full yearly"
"976","period.  Upon any termination of this Agreement before the"
"977","end of a year, the fee for such part of that year shall be"
"978","prorated according to the proportion that such period bears to"
"979","the full yearly period and shall be payable upon the date of"
"980","termination of this Agreement.  For the purpose of"
"981","determining fees payable to the Manager, the value of each"
"982","Fund's net assets shall be computed at the times and in the"
"983","manner specified in such Fund's Prospectus or SAI."
"984","7.                          Expenses"
"985","           The Manager will bear all expenses in"
"986","connection with the performance of its services under this"
"987","Agreement, including the fees payable to any investment sub-"
"988","adviser engaged pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Agreement;"
"989","provided, however, that each Fund will reimburse the"

"991","by it on behalf of the Fund with respect to services rendered"
"992","pursuant to paragraphs (l) through (ee) of Section 2 upon"
"993","presentation of appropriate documentation. Such reimbursable"
"994","expenses shall include, but not be limited to, postage,"

"1014","Fund and of the officers or Board of the applicable Trust; and"

"1016","           Each Fund will be responsible for nonrecurring"
"1017","expenses which may arise, including costs of litigation to"
"1018","which such Fund is a party and of indemnifying officers and"
"1019","Trustees of the applicable Trust with respect to such litigation"

"1021","8.                          Services to Other Companies or Accounts"
"1022","           Each Trust understands that the Manager now"
"1023","acts, will continue to act and may act in the future as"
"1024","investment adviser to fiduciary and other managed accounts"
"1025","and as investment adviser or manager to one or more other"
"1026","investment companies or series of investment companies, and"
"1027","such Trust has no objection to the Manager so acting, provided"
"1028","that whenever a Fund and one or more other accounts or"
"1029","investment companies or portfolios advised by the Manager"
"1030","have available funds for investment, investments suitable and"
"1031","appropriate for each will be allocated in accordance with a"
"1032","formula believed to be equitable to each entity.  Each Trust"
"1033","recognizes that in some cases this procedure may adversely"
"1034","affect the size of the position obtainable for a Fund.  In"
"1035","addition, each Trust understands that the persons employed by"
"1036","the Manager to assist in the performance of the Manager's"
"1037","duties hereunder will not devote their full time to such service"
"1038","and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit or"
"1039","restrict the right of the Manager or any affiliate of the"
"1040","Manager to engage in and devote time and attention to other"
"1041","businesses or to render services of whatever kind or nature,"
"1042","provided that doing so does not adversely affect the ability of"
"1043","the Manager to perform its services under this Agreement."

"1050","the Board of the applicable Trust or (b) a vote of a majority"
"1051","(as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund's outstanding voting"
"1052","securities, provided that in either event the continuance is also"
"1053","approved by a majority of the Board of the applicable Trust,"
"1054","who are not interested persons (as defined in said Act) of"
"1055","any party to this Agreement, by vote cast in person at a"
"1056","meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval."
"1057","This Agreement is terminable with respect to a Fund, without"
"1058","penalty, on 60 days' written notice, by the Board of the"
"1059","applicable Trust or by vote of holders of a majority of the"

"1061","the Manager.  This Agreement will also terminate"
"1062","automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in said"
"1063","Act)."

"1065","           Each Trust represents that copies of its"
"1066","Agreement and Declaration of Trust, together with all"
"1067","amendments thereto, are on file in such state where the"

"1069","11.                   Use of Names"
"1070","           Each Trust recognizes that directors, officers and"

"1074","that such other corporations and trusts may include the name"
"1075","CS or Credit Suisse as part of their names, and that the"
"1076","Manager or its affiliates may enter into advisory or other"
"1077","agreements with such other corporations and trusts.  If the"
"1078","Manager ceases to act as the investment adviser of a Fund,"
"1079","such Fund agrees that, at the Manager's request, such Fund's"
"1080","license to use the words CS or Credit Suisse will"
"1081","terminate and that such Fund will take all necessary action to"
"1082","change the name of such Fund to names not including the"
