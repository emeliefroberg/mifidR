"18561","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Portfolios' internal control"
"18562","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"18563","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"18564","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"18565","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"18566","the Portfolios' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"18567","express no such opinion."
"18568","<PAGE>"
"18569","Management of the Portfolios is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"18570","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"18571","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"18572","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"18573","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"18574","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"18575","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"18576","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"18577","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"18578","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"18579","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"18580","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"18581","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"18582","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"18583","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"18584","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"18585","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's"
"18586","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"18587","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"18588","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"18589","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"18590","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"18591","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"18592","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"18593","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"18594","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"18595","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"18596","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"18597","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"18598","Portfolios' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"18599","detected on a timely basis."
"18600","Our consideration of the Portfolios' internal control over financial reporting"
"18601","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"18602","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"18603","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"18604","Oversight Board (country-regionStateUnited States). However, we noted no"
"18605","deficiencies in the Portfolios' internal control over financial reporting and"
"18606","its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"18607","to be a material weakness as defined above as of December 31, 2007."

                         PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

      THIS AGREEMENT made as of the 14th day of December, 2007, among ING
Investors Trust (formerly The GCG Trust) (the Trust), a Massachusetts business
trust, Directed Services, LLC (the Manager), a New York corporation, and
Marsico Capital Management, LLC (Portfolio Manager), a limited liability
company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (the Agreement).

      WHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end management investment company;

      WHEREAS, the Trust is authorized to issue separate series, each of which
will offer a separate class of shares of beneficial interest, each series having
its own investment objective or objectives, policies, and limitations;

      WHEREAS, the Trust currently offers shares in multiple series, may offer
shares of additional series in the future, and intends to offer shares of
additional series in the future;

      WHEREAS, pursuant to two Management Agreements, one effective as of
October 24, 1997 and subsequently amended, and the second effective as of April
29, 2005 (the Management Agreements), copies of which have been provided to
the Portfolio Manager, the Trust has retained the Manager to render advisory,
management, and administrative services with respect to the Trust's series; and

      WHEREAS, the Trust and the Manager wish to retain the Portfolio Manager to
furnish investment advisory services to one or more of the series of the Trust,
and the Portfolio Manager is willing to furnish such services to the Trust and
the Manager.

      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the promises and
mutual covenants herein contained, it is agreed between the Trust, the Manager,
and the Portfolio Manager as follows:

      1. Appointment. The Trust and the Manager hereby appoint the Portfolio
Manager to act as an investment sub-adviser to the series of the Trust
designated on Schedule A of this Agreement (each a Series) for the periods and
on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Portfolio Manager accepts such
appointment and agrees to furnish the services herein set forth for the
compensation herein provided.

      In the event the Trust designates one or more series other than the Series
with respect to which the Trust and the Manager wish to retain the Portfolio
Manager to render investment advisory services hereunder (each, an Additional"
"19151","Series), the Manager shall promptly notify the Portfolio Manager in writing of
its desire to retain the Portfolio Manager to provide investment advisory
services to such Additional Series. If the Portfolio Manager is willing to
render such advisory services to the proposed Additional Series, the Portfolio
Manager shall so notify the Trust and Manager in writing. Upon receipt of the
written confirmation of acceptance of the Portfolio Manager with respect to each
Additional Series, Schedule A to this Agreement shall be amended to reflect the
addition of each such Additional Series and the services provided to each such
Additional Series shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement.
<PAGE>

      2. Portfolio Management Duties and Authority. Subject to the supervision
of the Trust's Board of Trustees and the Manager, the Portfolio Manager will
provide a continuous investment program for each Series' portfolio and determine
the composition of the assets of each Series' portfolio, including determination
of the purchase, retention, or sale of the securities, cash (except as described
below), and other investments contained in the portfolio. The Portfolio Manager
will provide investment research and conduct a continuous program of evaluation,
investment, sales, and reinvestment of each Series' assets by determining the
securities and other investments that shall be purchased, entered into, sold,
closed, or exchanged for the Series, when these transactions should be executed,
and what portion of the assets of each Series should be held in the various
securities and other investments in which it may invest, and the Portfolio
Manager is hereby authorized to execute and perform such services and
transactions on behalf of each Series. In accordance with the forgoing duties,
the Portfolio Manager is hereby authorized to act as agent for the portfolio to
order deposits and the investment of cash (except as described below) and
purchases and sales of securities for the Series' account and in the name of the
Trust, with the understanding that the Portfolio Manager will not act as
custodian of any assets of any Series, and that the custodian of each Series
will invest all surplus cash of the Series each day in money market funds or
overnight repurchase accounts to be monitored by the custodian and the Trust.
This authorization shall be a continuing one and shall remain in full force and
effect until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the provisions of
Section 16 hereof. To the extent permitted by the investment policies of each
Series, the Portfolio Manager shall make decisions for the Series as to foreign
currency matters and make determinations as to and execute and perform foreign
currency exchange contracts on behalf of the Series and shall have the authority
to act in such capacity as the Portfolio Manager deems necessary or desirable in
order to carry out its duties hereunder for the protection of the Series so long
as not expressly prohibited by the terms of this Agreement, the 1940 Act or
other securities laws or regulations. The Portfolio Manager will provide the
services under this Agreement in accordance with each Series' investment
objective or objectives, policies, and restrictions as stated in the Trust's
Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
SEC), as from time to time amended (the Registration Statement), copies of
which shall be sent to the Portfolio Manager by the Manager prior to the
commencement of this Agreement and promptly upon filing any such amendment with
the SEC. The Portfolio Manager further agrees as follows:

            (a) The Portfolio Manager will (i) manage each Series so that no
      action or omission on the part of the Portfolio Manager will cause a
      Series to fail to meet the requirements to qualify as a regulated
      investment company specified in Section 851 of the Internal Revenue Code
      of 1986, as amended (the Code) (other than the requirements for the
      Trust to register under the 1940 Act and to file with its tax return an
      election to be a regulated investment company, both of which shall not be
      the responsibility of the Portfolio Manager), (ii) manage each Series so
      that no action or omission on the part of the Portfolio Manager shall
      cause a Series to fail to comply with the diversification requirements of
      Section 817(h) of the Code, and the regulations issued thereunder, and
      (iii) use reasonable efforts to manage the Series so that no action or
      omission on the part of the Portfolio Manager shall cause a Series to fail
      to comply with any other rules and regulations pertaining to investment
      vehicles underlying variable annuity or variable life insurance policies.


                                        2
<PAGE>

      The Manager will notify the Portfolio Manager promptly if the Manager
      believes that a Series is in violation of any requirement specified in the
      first sentence of this paragraph. The Manager or the Trust will notify the
      Portfolio Manager of any pertinent changes, modifications to, or
      interpretations of Section 817(h) of the Code and regulations issued
      thereunder and of rules or regulations pertaining to investment vehicles
      underlying variable annuity or variable life insurance policies.

            (b) On occasions when the Portfolio Manager deems the purchase or
      sale of a security to be in the best interest of a Series as well as of
      other investment advisory clients of the Portfolio Manager or any of its
      affiliates, the Portfolio Manager may, to the extent permitted by
      applicable laws and regulations, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate
      the securities to be so sold or purchased with those of its other clients
      where such aggregation is not inconsistent with the policies set forth in
      the Registration Statement. In such event, allocation of the securities so
      purchased or sold, as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction,
      will be made by the Portfolio Manager in a manner that is fair and
      equitable in the judgment of the Portfolio Manager in the exercise of its
      fiduciary obligations to the Trust and to such other clients, provided,
      however that the Manager and the Board shall have the right to review and
      request changes to the Portfolio Manager's manner of allocation, provided
      further that any requested changes to such manner of allocation that are
      agreed to by the Portfolio Manager shall be implemented on a prospective
      basis only.

            (c) In connection with the purchase and sale of securities for each
      Series, the Portfolio Manager will arrange for the transmission to the
      custodian and portfolio accounting agent for the Series on a daily basis,
      such confirmation, trade tickets, and other documents and information,
      including, but not limited to, Cusip, Sedol, or other numbers that
      identify securities to be purchased or sold on behalf of the Series, as
      may be reasonably necessary to enable the custodian and portfolio
      accounting agent to perform their administrative and recordkeeping
      responsibilities with respect to the Series. With respect to portfolio
      securities to be purchased or sold through the Depository Trust Company,
      the Portfolio Manager will arrange for the automatic transmission of the
      confirmation of such trades to the Trust's custodian and portfolio
      accounting agent.

            (d) The Portfolio Manager will assist the portfolio accounting agent
      for the Trust in determining or confirming, consistent with the procedures
      and policies stated in the Registration Statement, the value of any
      portfolio securities or other assets of the Series for which the portfolio
      accounting agent reasonably seeks assistance from or identifies for review
      by the Portfolio Manager, and the parties agree that the Portfolio Manager
      shall not bear responsibility or liability for the determination or
      accuracy of the valuation of any portfolio securities and other assets of
      the Series.

            (e) The Portfolio Manager will make available to the Trust and the
      Manager, promptly upon reasonable request, all of the Series' investment
      records and ledgers maintained by the Portfolio Manager (which shall not
      include the records and ledgers maintained by the custodian and portfolio
      accounting agent for the Trust) as are necessary to assist the Trust and
      the Manager to comply with requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment
      Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act), as well as other applicable
      laws. The Portfolio Manager will furnish to regulatory authorities having
      the requisite authority any information or reports in connection with such
      services which may be requested in order to ascertain whether the
      operations of the Trust are being conducted in a manner consistent with
      applicable laws and regulations.

            (f) The Portfolio Manager will provide reports to the Trust's Board
      of Trustees for consideration at meetings of the Board on the investment
      program for the Series and the issuers and securities represented in the
      Series' portfolio, and will furnish the Trust's Board of Trustees with
      respect to the Series such periodic and special reports as the Trustees
      and the Manager may reasonably request.

            (g) In rendering the services required under this Agreement, the
      Portfolio Manager may, from time to time, employ or associate with itself
      such person or persons as it believes necessary to assist it in carrying
      out its obligations under this Agreement. The Portfolio Manager may not
      retain, employ or associate itself with any company that would be an
      investment adviser, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, to the
      Series unless the contract with such company is approved by a majority of
      the Trust's Board of Trustees and a majority of Trustees who are not
      parties to any agreement or contract with such company and who are not
      interested persons, as defined in the 1940 Act, of the Trust, the
      Manager, or the Portfolio Manager, or any such company, and is approved by
      the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the
      applicable Series of the Trust to the extent required by the 1940 Act. The
      Portfolio Manager shall be responsible for making reasonable inquiries and
      for reasonably ensuring that any associated person of the Portfolio
      Manager, or of any company that the Portfolio Manager has retained,
      employed, or with which it has associated with respect to the Series, to
      the best of the Portfolio Manager's knowledge, in any material connection
      with the handling of assets, has not:

                  (i) been convicted, in the last ten (10) years, of any felony
            or misdemeanor arising out of conduct involving embezzlement,
            fraudulent conversion, or misappropriation of funds or securities,
            involving violations of Sections 1341, 1342, or 1343 of Title 18,
            United States Code, or involving the purchase or sale of any
            security; or

                  (ii) been found by any state regulatory authority, within the
            last ten (10) years, to have violated or to have acknowledged
            violation of any provision of any state insurance law involving
            fraud, deceit, or knowing misrepresentation; or

                  (iii) been found by any federal or state regulatory
            authorities, within the last ten (10) years, to have violated or to
            have acknowledged violation of any provision of federal or state
            securities laws involving fraud, deceit, or knowing
            misrepresentation.

            (h) In using spot and forward foreign exchange contracts for the
      Series as an investment or for hedging purposes, the parties represent the
      following:


                                        4
<PAGE>

                  (i) That the Manager is properly and lawfully established with
            full power and authority to enter into spot and forward foreign
            exchange contracts, to perform its obligations under such foreign
            exchange contracts and to procure the Portfolio Manager to enter
            into such foreign exchange contracts on its behalf.

                  (ii) That the Manager may not, except for purposes of
            redemptions, expenses, and other costs of doing business, encumber
            funds which the Portfolio Manager has under the Portfolio Manager's
            management or which benefit from the Portfolio Manager's investment
            advice. If the Manager requires funds for any redemptions, expenses,
            and other costs of doing business, the Portfolio Manager will make
            funds available in a reasonably timely manner for the Manager to
            meet such obligations. The Manager reserves the right to segregate
            assets upon notice to the Portfolio Manager and provide different
            arrangements for investment management with respect to those assets.

                  (iii) That the Portfolio Manager has been granted full power
            and authority to enter into foreign exchange contracts as agent on
            the Manager's behalf and to give instructions for settlement for the
            same.

                  (iv) That the Portfolio Manager has full authority to instruct
            Manager's and Trust's custodian in conformity with its mandate.

                  (v) That in the event of the termination of this Agreement,
            the Portfolio Manager may offer its counterparty the ability to
            leave open any existing foreign exchange contracts or to close them
            out at prevailing market rates.

            (i) Manager reserves for itself the responsibility to vote all
      proxies for equity securities held by the Series, and Portfolio Manager
      shall not be responsible for voting any such proxies unless otherwise
      directed by Manager in written instructions provided to Portfolio Manager
      with reasonable advance notice. Portfolio Manager shall not have any
      responsibility for giving notice of, filing, collecting, or otherwise
      taking any action on any claims that the Series or Trust may be entitled
      to assert in securities class-action lawsuits or other legal actions
      relating to any securities held in the Series. Until this Agreement is
      terminated, upon Manager's request, Portfolio Manager will use its best
      efforts to forward to Manager or the custodian for the Series material
      information that Portfolio Manager receives regarding legal actions
      concerning securities held in the Series.

      3. Broker-Dealer Selection. The Portfolio Manager is hereby authorized to
place orders for the purchase and sale of securities and other investments for
each Series' portfolio, with or through such persons, brokers, or dealers as the
Portfolio Manager may select, and to negotiate commissions to be paid on such
transactions and to supervise the execution thereof. The Portfolio Manager's
primary consideration in effecting any such transaction will be to seek best
execution of orders for the Series, taking into account the factors specified in
the Registration Statement, which include price (including the applicable
brokerage commission or dollar spread), the size of the order, the nature of the
market for the security, the timing of the transaction, the reputation, the
experience and financial stability of the broker-dealer involved, the quality of
the service, the difficulty of execution, and the execution capabilities and
operational facilities of the firms involved, and the firm's risk in positioning
a block of securities. Accordingly, the price to a Series in any transaction may
be less favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the
difference is reasonably justified, in the judgment of the Portfolio Manager in
the exercise of its fiduciary obligations to the Trust, by other aspects of the
portfolio execution services offered.


                                        5
<PAGE>

      Subject to such policies as the Board of Trustees may determine and
consistent with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
Portfolio Manager may effect a transaction on behalf of the Series with a
broker-dealer who provides brokerage research services to the Portfolio Manager
notwithstanding the fact that the commissions payable with respect to any such
transaction may be greater than the amount of any commission another
broker-dealer might have charged for effecting that transaction, if the
Portfolio Manager determines in good faith that such amount of commission was
reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services
provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular
transaction or the Portfolio Manager's or its affiliate's overall
responsibilities with respect to the Series and to their other clients as to
which they exercise investment discretion.

      The Portfolio Manager will consult with the Manager to the end that
portfolio transactions on behalf of a Series are directed to broker-dealers on
the basis of criteria reasonably considered appropriate by the Manager. Manager
may instruct the Portfolio Manager to use its best efforts to execute a portion
of securities transactions on behalf of a Series, not to exceed 25% of the
securities transactions for such Series on an annual basis, with or through one
or more brokers designated by Manager. Manager represents and warrants that it
has negotiated and is satisfied with its selection of such brokers, their
commission rates, execution quality, and all other terms and conditions relating
to the services to be provided by such brokers in connection with all such
transactions. To the extent consistent with this Agreement and any applicable
laws, the Portfolio Manager is further authorized to allocate orders placed by
it on behalf of the Series to any of the Portfolio Manager's affiliated
broker-dealers as agents or to such brokers and dealers who also provide
research or statistical material, or other services to the Series, the Portfolio
Manager or its other clients, provided that the Manager and the Portfolio
Manager will not knowingly allocate orders to any broker or dealer to compensate
the broker or dealer for its services in distributing shares of the Series or
other mutual funds. An affiliated broker may execute transactions for a Series
on an exchange floor, and receive and retain all commissions, fees, and benefits
without complying further with Section 11(a) of the Securities Exchange Act. An
affiliated broker also may execute agency cross trades, in which the affiliated
broker acts as broker both for a Series and for the counterparty to the
transaction. Agency cross trades may enable the Portfolio Manager to purchase or
sell a block of securities for its clients at a set price, and possibly avoid an
unfavorable price movement that may be created through entrance into the market
with such purchase or sale order. Portfolio Manager will comply with any legal
requirements that may apply, including, but not limited to, Rule 17e-1 under the
1940 Act and Rule 206(3)-2 under the Advisers Act, as well any procedures
adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Trust. Manager is aware that the
affiliation between the Portfolio Manager and an affiliated broker could give
the Portfolio Manager an indirect interest in brokerage commissions received by
the affiliated broker, and that agency cross trades could create potentially
conflicting divisions of loyalties and responsibilities, because the affiliated
broker acts for and receives commissions from both sides of the trade. Such
allocation shall be in such amounts and proportions as the Portfolio Manager
shall determine consistent with the above standards, and the Portfolio Manager
will report on said allocation regularly to the Board indicating the
broker-dealers to which such allocations have been made and the basis therefor.
Manager may at any time revoke its consent to the execution of future trades
with an affiliated broker for a Series by giving written notice to Portfolio
Manager or the affiliated broker.

      4. Disclosure about Portfolio Manager. The Portfolio Manager has reviewed
as of the effective date of this Agreement the post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement for the Trust filed with the SEC that contains disclosure
about the Portfolio Manager, and represents and warrants that, with respect to
the disclosure about or information relating, directly or indirectly, to the
Portfolio Manager, to the Portfolio Manager's knowledge, such Registration
Statement contains, as of the effective date hereof, no untrue statement of any
material fact and does not omit any statement of a material fact which was
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained
therein not misleading. The Portfolio Manager further represents and warrants
that it is a duly registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act, or
alternatively that it is not required to be a registered investment adviser
under the Advisers Act to perform the duties described in this Agreement, and
that it is a duly registered investment adviser in all states in which the
Portfolio Manager is required to be registered and will maintain such
registration so long as this Agreement remains in effect. The Portfolio Manager
will provide the Manager with a copy of the Portfolio Manager's Form ADV, Part
II at least once each year during the term of this Agreement and at such other
times as reasonably may be requested in writing by the Manager, and a copy of
its written code of ethics complying with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under
the 1940 Act, together with evidence of its adoption. Manager represents that it
has received Portfolio Manager's current Form ADV Part II at least 48 hours
prior to entering into this Agreement.

      5. Expenses. During the term of this Agreement, the Portfolio Manager will
pay all expenses incurred by it and its staff and for their activities in
connection with its portfolio management duties under this Agreement. The
Manager or the Trust shall be responsible for all the expenses of the Trust's
operations including, but not limited to:

            (g) Salaries and other compensation of any of the Trust's executive

            (h) Taxes levied against the Trust;

            (i) Brokerage fees and commissions, transfer fees, registration
      fees, taxes and similar liabilities and costs properly payable or incurred
      in connection with the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the
      Series;

            (j) Costs, including the interest expense, of borrowing money;

            (k) Costs and/or fees incident to meetings of the Trust's

      shares with federal and state securities or insurance authorities;

            (l) The Trust's legal fees, including the legal fees related to the
      registration and continued qualification of the Trust's shares for sale;

            (m) Trustees' fees and expenses to trustees who are not officers,

      Section 17(g) of the 1940 Act, or other insurance premiums;

            (o) Association membership dues;

            (p) Extraordinary expenses of the Trust as may arise including

      6. Compensation. For the services provided to each Series, the Manager
will pay the Portfolio Manager a fee, payable as described in Schedule A.

      The fee will be prorated to reflect any portion of a calendar month that
this Agreement is not in effect among the parties. In accordance with the
provisions of the Management Agreements, the Manager is solely responsible for
the payment of fees to the Portfolio Manager, and the Portfolio Manager agrees
to seek payment of its fees solely from the Manager.

      7. Seed Money. The Manager agrees that the Portfolio Manager shall not be
responsible for providing money for the initial capitalization of the Series.

      8. Compliance.

            (a) The Trust and the Manager acknowledge that the Portfolio Manager
      is not the compliance agent for any Series or for the Trust or the
      Manager, and does not have access to all of each Series' books and records
      necessary to perform certain compliance testing. To the extent that the
      Portfolio Manager has agreed to perform the services specified in Section
      2 in accordance with the Trust's registration statement, the Trust's
      Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, the
      Trust's Prospectus and any policies adopted by the Trust's Board of
      Trustees applicable to the Series (collectively, the Charter"
"19152","      Requirements), and in accordance with applicable law (including
      Subchapters M and L of the Code, the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act
      (Applicable Law)), the Portfolio Manager shall perform such services
      based upon its books and records with respect to each Series, which
      comprise a portion of each Series' books and records, and upon information
      and written instructions received from the Trust, the Manager or the
      Trust's administrator, and shall not be held responsible under this
      Agreement so long as it performs such services in accordance with this
      Agreement, the Charter Requirements and Applicable Law based upon such
      books and records and such information and instructions provided by the
      Trust, the Manager, or the Trust's administrator. The Manager shall
      promptly provide the Portfolio Manager with copies of the Trust's
      registration statement, the Trust's Amended and Restated Agreement and
      Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, the Trust's currently effective
      Prospectus and any written policies and procedures adopted by the Trust's
      Board of Trustees applicable to the Portfolio and any amendments or
      revisions thereto.

            (b) The Portfolio Manager agrees that it shall promptly notify the
      Manager and the Trust (i) in the event that the SEC or other governmental
      authority has censured the Portfolio Manager; placed limitations upon its
      activities, functions or operations; suspended or revoked its
      registration, if any, as an investment adviser; or has commenced
      proceedings or an investigation that may result in any of these actions,
      (ii) upon having a reasonable basis for believing that the Series has
      ceased to qualify or might not qualify as a regulated investment company
      under Subchapter M of the Code, or (iii) upon having a reasonable basis
      for believing that the Series has ceased to comply with the
      diversification provisions of Section 817(h) of the Code or the
      regulations thereunder. The Portfolio Manager further agrees to notify the
      Manager and the Trust promptly of any material fact known to the Portfolio
      Manager respecting or relating to the Portfolio Manager that is not
      contained in the Registration Statement as then in effect, and is required
      to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
      misleading, or of any statement contained therein that becomes untrue in
      any material respect.

            (c) The Manager agrees that it shall immediately notify the
      Portfolio Manager (i) in the event that the SEC has censured the Manager
      or the Trust; placed limitations upon either of their activities,
      functions, or operations; suspended or revoked the Manager's registration
      as an investment adviser; or has commenced proceedings or an investigation
      that may result in any of these actions, (ii) upon having a reasonable
      basis for believing that the Series has ceased to qualify or might not
      qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code,
      or (iii) upon having a reasonable basis for believing that the Series has
      ceased to comply with the diversification provisions of Section 817(h) of
      the Code or the regulations thereunder.

      9. Books and Records. In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3
under the 1940 Act, the Portfolio Manager hereby agrees that all records which
it maintains for the Series are the property of the Trust and further agrees to
surrender promptly to the Trust any of such records upon the Trust's or the
Manager's reasonable request, although the Portfolio Manager may, at its own
expense, make and retain a copy of such records. The Portfolio Manager further
agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act
the records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-l under the 1940 Act and to
preserve the records required by Rule 204-2 under the Advisers Act for the
period specified in such rules.

      10. Cooperation; Confidentiality. Each party to this Agreement agrees to
cooperate with each other party and with all appropriate governmental
authorities having the requisite jurisdiction (including, but not limited to,
the SEC and state insurance regulators) in connection with any investigation or
inquiry relating to this Agreement or the Trust.

      Subject to the foregoing, the Portfolio Manager shall treat as
confidential all information pertaining to the Trust and actions of the Trust,
the Manager and the Portfolio Manager; and the Manager shall treat as
confidential and use only in connection with the Series all information
furnished to the Trust or the Manager by the Portfolio Manager, in connection
with its duties under the Agreement; except that the aforesaid information need
not be treated as confidential if the information is required to be disclosed
under applicable law, is generally available to the public through means other
than by disclosure by the Portfolio Manager or the Manager, or is available from
a source other than the Manager, Portfolio Manager or the Trust. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Portfolio Manager may disclose information about the Series
to its affiliates for operational, compliance, or risk management purposes, or
to other persons such as the custodian of the Series, brokers, and other service
providers to the Series or to the Portfolio Manager to the extent reasonably
necessary for the Portfolio Manager to perform its duties under this Agreement.

      11. Representations Respecting Portfolio Manager.

            (a) During the term of this Agreement, the Trust and the Manager
      agree to furnish to the Portfolio Manager at its principal offices prior
      to use thereof copies of all Registration Statements and amendments
      thereto, prospectuses, proxy statements, reports to shareholders, sales
      literature or other material prepared for distribution to shareholders of
      the Trust or any Series or to the public that refer or relate in any way
      to the Portfolio Manager or any of its affiliates (other than the
      Manager), or that use any derivative of the names Marsico or Marsico"
"19153","      Capital Management, LLC, or any logos associated therewith. The Trust and
      the Manager agree that they will not use any such material without the
      prior consent of the Portfolio Manager, which consent shall not be
      unreasonably withheld. In the event of the termination of this Agreement,
      the Trust and the Manager will furnish to the Portfolio Manager copies of
      any of the above-mentioned materials that refer or relate in any way to
      the Portfolio Manager;


                                       10
<PAGE>

            (b) The Trust and the Manager will furnish to the Portfolio Manager
      such information relating to either of them or the business affairs of the
      Trust as the Portfolio Manager shall from time to time reasonably request
      in order to discharge its obligations hereunder;

            (c) The Manager and the Trust agree that neither the Trust, the
      Manager, nor affiliated persons of the Trust or the Manager shall give any
      information or make any representations or statements in connection with
      the sale of shares of the Series concerning the Portfolio Manager or the
      Series other than the information or representations contained in the
      Registration Statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information
      for the Trust, as they may be amended or supplemented from time to time,
      or in reports or proxy statements for the Trust, or in sales literature or
      other promotional material approved in advance by the Portfolio Manager,
      except with the prior permission of the Portfolio Manager.

      12. Services Not Exclusive. The services of the Portfolio Manager to the
Series and the Trust are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Portfolio
Manager shall be free to render investment advisory or other services to others
(including other investment companies) and to engage in other activities.

      13. Prohibited Conduct. The Portfolio Manager may not knowingly consult
with any other portfolio manager of the Trust concerning transactions in
securities or other assets for any investment portfolio of the Trust, including
the Series, except that such consultations are permitted between the current and
successor portfolio managers of the Series in order to effect an orderly
transition of portfolio management duties so long as such consultations are not
concerning transactions prohibited by Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act.

      14. Liability. Except as may otherwise be required by the 1940 Act or the
rules thereunder or other applicable law, the Trust and the Manager agree that
the Portfolio Manager, any affiliated person of the Portfolio Manager, and each
person, if any, who, within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, controls
the Portfolio Manager (a) shall bear no responsibility and shall not be subject
to any liability for any act or omission respecting any series of the Trust that
is not a Series hereunder; and (b) shall not be liable for any error of
judgment, mistake of law, any diminution in value of the investment portfolio of
the Series, or subject to any damages, expenses, or losses in connection with,
any act or omission connected with or arising out of any services rendered under
this Agreement, except by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross
negligence in the performance by the Portfolio Manager of its duties, or by
reason of reckless disregard by the Portfolio Manager of its obligations and
duties under this Agreement. Portfolio Manager makes no representation or
warranty, express or implied, that any level of performance or investment
results will be achieved by any Series, or that the Series will perform
comparably with any standard or index, including other clients of Portfolio
Manager.

      15. Indemnification.

            (a) Notwithstanding Section 14 of this Agreement, the Manager agrees
      to indemnify and hold harmless the Portfolio Manager, any affiliated
      person of the Portfolio Manager (other than the Manager), and each person,
      if any, who, within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act controls
      (controlling person) the Portfolio Manager (all of such persons being
      referred to as Portfolio Manager Indemnified Persons) against any and
      all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or litigation (including legal
      and other expenses) to which a Portfolio Manager Indemnified Person may
      become subject under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the
      Code, under any other statute, at common law or otherwise, arising out of
      the Manager's responsibilities to the Trust which (i) may be based upon
      any violations of willful misconduct, malfeasance, bad faith or negligence
      by the Manager, any of its employees or representatives, or any affiliate
      of or any person acting on behalf of the Manager, or (ii) may be based
      upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
      supplied by, or which is the responsibility of, the Manager and contained
      in the Registration Statement or prospectus covering shares of the Trust
      or any Series, or any amendment thereof or any supplement thereto, or the
      omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact known or
      which should have been known to the Manager and was required to be stated
      therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, unless
      such statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished
      to the Manager or the Trust or to any affiliated person of the Manager by
      a Portfolio Manager Indemnified Person; provided however, that in no case
      shall the indemnity in favor of the Portfolio Manager Indemnified Person
      be deemed to protect such person against any liability to which any such
      person would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad
      faith, or negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of its
      reckless disregard of obligations and duties under this Agreement.

            (b) Notwithstanding Section 14 of this Agreement, the Portfolio
      Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Manager, any affiliated
      person of the Manager (other than the Portfolio Manager), and each person,
      if any, who, is a controlling person of the Manager (all of such persons
      being referred to as Manager Indemnified Persons) against any and all
      losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or litigation (including legal and
      other expenses) to which a Manager Indemnified Person may become subject
      under the 1933 Act, 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the Code, under any other
      statute, at common law or otherwise, arising out of the Portfolio
      Manager's responsibilities as Portfolio Manager of the Series which (i)
      may be based upon any violations of willful misconduct, malfeasance, bad
      faith or negligence by the Portfolio Manager, any of its employees or
      representatives, or any affiliate of or any person acting on behalf of the
      Portfolio Manager, including but not limited to its responsibilities under
      Section 2, Paragraph (a) of this Agreement, or (ii) any material breach of
      any representations or warranties contained in Section 4; provided,
      however, that in no case shall the indemnity in favor of a Manager
      Indemnified Person be deemed to protect such person against any liability
      to which any such person would otherwise be subject by reason of willful
      misfeasance, bad faith, negligence in the performance of its duties, or by
      reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this
      Agreement.

            (c) The Manager shall not be liable under Paragraph (a) of this
      Section 15 with respect to any claim made against a Portfolio Manager
      Indemnified Person unless such Portfolio Manager Indemnified Person shall
      have notified the Manager in writing within a reasonable time after the
      summons, notice, or other first legal process or notice giving information
      of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such Portfolio
      Manager Indemnified Person (or after such Portfolio Manager Indemnified
      Person shall have received notice of such service on any designated
      agent), but failure to notify the Manager of any such claim shall not
      relieve the Manager from any liability which it may have to the Portfolio
      Manager Indemnified Person against whom such action is brought except to
      the extent the Manager is prejudiced by the failure or delay in giving
      such notice. In case any such action is brought against the Portfolio
      Manager Indemnified Person, the Manager will be entitled to participate,
      at its own expense, in the defense thereof or, after notice to the
      Portfolio Manager Indemnified Person, to assume the defense thereof, with
      counsel satisfactory to the Portfolio Manager Indemnified Person. If the
      Manager assumes the defense of any such action and the selection of
      counsel by the Manager to represent both the Manager and the Portfolio
      Manager Indemnified Person would result in a conflict of interests and
      therefore, would not, in the reasonable judgment of the Portfolio Manager
      Indemnified Person, adequately represent the interests of the Portfolio
      Manager Indemnified Person, the Manager will, at its own expense, assume
      the defense with counsel to the Manager and, also at its own expense, with
      separate counsel to the Portfolio Manager Indemnified Person, which
      counsel shall be satisfactory to the Manager and to the Portfolio Manager
      Indemnified Person. The Portfolio Manager Indemnified Person shall bear
      the fees and expenses of any additional counsel retained by it, and the
      Manager shall not be liable to the Portfolio Manager Indemnified Person
      under this Agreement for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
      by the Portfolio Manager Indemnified Person independently in connection
      with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. The
      Manager shall not have the right to compromise on or settle the litigation
      without the prior written consent of the Portfolio Manager Indemnified
      Person if the compromise or settlement results, or may result, in a
      finding of wrongdoing on the part of the Portfolio Manager Indemnified
      Person.

            (d) The Portfolio Manager shall not be liable under Paragraph (b) of
      this Section 15 with respect to any claim made against a Manager
      Indemnified Person unless such Manager Indemnified Person shall have
      notified the Portfolio Manager in writing within a reasonable time after
      the summons, notice, or other first legal process or notice giving
      information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such
      Manager Indemnified Person (or after such Manager Indemnified Person shall
      have received notice of such service on any designated agent), but failure
      to notify the Portfolio Manager of any such claim shall not relieve the
      Portfolio Manager from any liability which it may have to the Manager
      Indemnified Person against whom such action is brought except to the
      extent the Portfolio Manager is prejudiced by the failure or delay in
      giving such notice. In case any such action is brought against the Manager
      Indemnified Person, the Portfolio Manager will be entitled to participate,
      at its own expense, in the defense thereof or, after notice to the Manager
      Indemnified Person, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel
      satisfactory to the Manager Indemnified Person.

<PAGE>

      If the Portfolio Manager assumes the defense of any such action and the
      selection of counsel by the Portfolio Manager to represent both the
      Portfolio Manager and the Manager Indemnified Person would result in a
      conflict of interests and therefore, would not, in the reasonable judgment
      of the Manager Indemnified Person, adequately represent the interests of
      the Manager Indemnified Person, the Portfolio Manager will, at its own
      expense, assume the defense with counsel to the Portfolio Manager and,
      also at its own expense, with separate counsel to the Manager Indemnified
      Person, which counsel shall be satisfactory to the Portfolio Manager and
      to the Manager Indemnified Person. The Manager Indemnified Person shall
      bear the fees and expenses of any additional counsel retained by it, and
      the Portfolio Manager shall not be liable to the Manager Indemnified
      Person under this Agreement for any legal or other expenses subsequently
      incurred by the Manager Indemnified Person independently in connection
      with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. The
      Portfolio Manager shall not have the right to compromise on or settle the
      litigation without the prior written consent of the Manager Indemnified
      Person if the compromise or settlement results, or may result in a finding
      of wrongdoing on the part of the Manager Indemnified Person.

      16. Duration and Termination. With respect to each Series identified as a
Series on Schedule A hereto as in effect on the date of this Agreement, unless
earlier terminated with respect to any Series this Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect through November 30, 2008. Thereafter, unless earlier
terminated with respect to a Series, the Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect with respect to each such Series for periods of one year, provided
that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (i) the vote
of a majority of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or (ii) the vote of a
majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of
the Series, and provided that such continuance is also approved by the vote of a
majority of the Board of Trustees of the Trust who are not parties to this
Agreement or interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust or
the Manager, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on
such approval.

With respect to any Series that may be added to Schedule A hereto as a Series
after the effective date of this Agreement, the Agreement shall become effective
on the later of (i) the date Schedule A is amended to reflect the addition of
such Series as a Series under the Agreement or (ii) the date upon which the
shares of the Series are first sold to the public, subject to the condition that
the Trust's Board of Trustees, including a majority of those Trustees who are
not interested persons (as such term is defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust or
the Manager, and the shareholders of such Series, shall have approved this
Agreement. Unless terminated earlier as provided herein with respect to any such
Series, the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect for a period of
two years from the date of its effectiveness (as identified above) with respect
to that Series. Thereafter, unless earlier terminated with respect to a Series,
the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect with respect to each such
Series for periods of one year, provided that such continuance is specifically
approved at least annually by (i) the vote of a majority of the Board of
Trustees of the Trust, or (ii) vote of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of such Series, and provided that such
continuance is also approved by the vote of a majority of the Board of Trustees
of the Trust who are not parties to this Agreement or interested persons (as
defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust or the Manager, cast in person at a
meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval.

The Portfolio Manager shall not provide any services for such Series or receive
any fees on account of such Series with respect to which this Agreement is not
approved as described in the preceding sentence. However, any approval of this
Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares (as defined in
the 1940 Act) of a Series shall be effective to continue this Agreement with
respect to such Series notwithstanding (i) that this Agreement has not been
approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of any other
Series or (ii) that this agreement has not been approved by the vote of a
majority of the outstanding shares of the Trust, unless such approval shall be
required by any other applicable law or otherwise.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated for each or any
Series hereunder: (a) by the Manager at any time without penalty, upon sixty
(60) days' written notice to the Portfolio Manager and the Trust, (b) at any
time without payment of any penalty by the Trust, upon the vote of a majority of
the Trust's Board of Trustees or a majority of the outstanding voting securities
of each Series, upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the Manager and the
Portfolio Manager, or (c) by the Portfolio Manager at any time without penalty,
upon three (3) months' written notice to the Manager and the Trust, unless the
Manager or the Trust requests additional time to find a replacement for the
Portfolio Manager, in which case the Portfolio Manager shall allow the
additional time requested by the Trust or the Manager not to exceed three (3)
months beyond the initial three-month notice period; provided however, that the
Portfolio Manager may terminate this Agreement at any time without penalty
effective upon written notice to the Manager and the Trust, in the event either
the Portfolio Manager (acting in good faith) or the Manager ceases to be
registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act or otherwise becomes
legally incapable of providing investment management services pursuant to its
respective contract with the Trust, or in the event the Manager becomes bankrupt
or otherwise incapable of carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, or
in the event that the Portfolio Manager does not receive compensation for its
services from the Manager or the Trust as required by the terms of this
Agreement. In addition, this Agreement shall terminate with respect to a Series
in the event that it is not approved by the vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of that Series at a meeting of shareholders at
which approval of the Agreement shall be considered by shareholders of the
Series.

In the event of termination for any reason, all records of each Series for which
the Agreement is terminated shall promptly be returned to the Manager or the
Trust, free from any claim or retention of rights in such records by the
Portfolio Manager, although the Portfolio Manager may, at its own expense, make
and retain a copy of such records. The Agreement shall automatically terminate
in the event of its assignment (as such term is described in the 1940 Act). In
the event this Agreement is terminated or is not approved in the manner
described above, the Sections or Paragraphs numbered 2(f), 9, 10, 11, 14, 15,
and 19 of this Agreement shall remain in effect, as well as any applicable
provision of this Paragraph numbered 16.
