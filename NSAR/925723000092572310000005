"528","Report of Independent Registered"
"529","Public Accounting Firm"
"530","To the Shareholders and"
"531","Board of Trustees of"
"532","Federated Institutional Trust"
"533","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"534","statements of Federated Intermediate"
"535","Government / Corporate Fund, a portfolio of Federated"
"536","Institutional Trust as of and for the year"
"537","ended August 31, 2010, in accordance with the"
"538","standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"539","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"540","Funds' internal control over financial"
"541","reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"542","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"543","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"544","on the financial statements and to comply"
"545","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"546","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"547","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"548","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"549","such opinion."
"550","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"551","and maintaining effective internal"
"552","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"553","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"554","management are required to assess the expected benefits"
"555","and related costs of controls. A"
"556","company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"557","process designed to provide reasonable"
"558","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"559","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"560","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"561","generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"562","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"563","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"564","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"565","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"566","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"567","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"568","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"569","preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"570","with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"571","receipts and expenditures of the company"
"572","are being made in accordance with authorizations of"
"573"," management and directors of the company;"
"574","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"575","timely detection of the unauthorized"
"576","acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets"
"577","that could have a material affect on the"
"578","financial statements."
"579","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"580","financial reporting may not prevent or"
"581","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"582","of effectiveness to future periods are"
"583","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"584","because of changes in conditions, or that"
"585","the degree of compliance with the policies"
"586","or procedures may deteriorate."
"587","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"588","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"589","control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"590","normal course of performing their"
"591","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"592","on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"593","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"594","control over financial reporting, such that"
"595","there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"596","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim"
"597","financial statements will not be prevented"
"598","or detected on a timely basis."
"599","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control"
"600","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"601","purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"602","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"603","internal control that might be material weaknesses"
"604","under standards established by the Public"
"605","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"606","However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"607","Funds' internal control over financial reporting and"
"608","its operation, including controls over"
"609","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"610","material weakness as defined above as of August"
"611","31, 2010."
"612","This report is intended solely for the information"
"613","and use of management and the Board of"

"649","PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"650","On May 14, 2010, the Fund's Trustees, upon"
"651","the recommendation of the Audit"

"665","August 31, 2009, and the interim period"
"666","commencing September 1, 2009 and ending May 14, 2010:"
"667","(i) there were no"

"669","principles or practices, financial"
"670","statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure,"
"671","which disagreements, if not resolved"
"672","to the satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused it to"
"673","make reference to the subject matter"
"674","of the disagreements in connection with its reports"

"676","years; and (ii) there were no reportable events of"
"677","the kind described in Item 304(a) (1) (v)"
"678","of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange"
"679","Act of 1934, as amended."
"680","      As indicated above, the Fund has appointed"

"707","Since October 2003, Federated and related"
"708","entities (collectively, Federated) and various"
"709","Federated-sponsored mutual funds (Funds) have been"
"710","named as defendants in several class"
"711","action lawsuits now pending in the United States"
"712","District Court for the District of Maryland. The"
"713","lawsuits were purportedly filed on behalf of people"
"714","who purchased, owned and/or redeemed"
"715","shares of certain Funds during specified periods"
"716","beginning November 1, 1998. The suits are"
"717","generally similar in alleging that Federated engaged"
"718","in illegal and improper trading practices"
"719","including market timing and late trading in concert"
"720","with certain institutional traders, which"
"721","allegedly caused financial injury to the mutual fund"
"722","shareholders. Federated without admitting the"
"723","validity of any claim has reached a preliminary"
"724","settlement with the Plaintiffs in these cases. Any"
"725","settlement would have to be approved by the Court."
"726","     Federated entities have also been named as defendants"
"727","in several additional lawsuits that"
"728","are now pending in the United States District Court for"
"729","the Western District of Pennsylvania."
"730","These lawsuits have been consolidated into a single action"
"731","alleging excessive advisory fees"
"732","involving one of the Funds."
"733","     The Board of the Funds retained the law firm of"
"734","Dickstein Shapiro LLP to represent the"
"735","Funds in each of the lawsuits described in the preceding"
"736","two paragraphs. Federated and the"
"737","Funds, and their respective counsel, have been defending"
"738","this litigation, and none of the Funds"
"739","remains a defendant in any of the lawsuits. Additional"
"740","lawsuits based upon similar allegations"
"741","may be filed in the future. The potential impact of these"
"742","lawsuits, all of which seek monetary"
"743","damages, attorneys' fees and expenses, and future potential"
"744","similar suits is uncertain. Although"
"745","we do not believe that these lawsuits will have a material"
"746","adverse effect on the Funds, there can"
"747","be no assurance that these suits, ongoing adverse publicity"
"748","and/or other developments resulting"
"749","from the allegations in these matters will not result"
"750","in increased redemptions, or reduced sales of"
"751","shares of the Funds or other adverse"
"752","consequences for the Funds."
