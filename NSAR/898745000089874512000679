"3313","ARTICLE V"
"3314","Capital Stock Allocation"
"3315","         Authorized Shares:  The total number of shares of stock which the"
"3316","Corporation shall have authority to issue is sixty-six billion two"
"3317","hundred eighty million (66,280,000,000) shares of stock of which six"

"3352","to and borne solely by such series or class, and the bearing of"
"3353","expenses solely by a series or class may be appropriately reflected (in"

"3356","liquidation rights of, the shares of each series or class. Subject to"
"3357","the authority of the Board of Directors to increase and decrease the"

"4495","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"4496","The Shareholders and Board of Directors"
"4497","Principal Funds, Inc."
"4498","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Blue"
"4499","Chip Fund, Bond Market Index Fund, Diversified Real Asset Fund, Global Multi-"
"4500","Strategy Fund, International Equity Index Fund, Opportunistic Municipal Fund,"
"4501","Preferred Securities Fund, and Small-MidCap Dividend Income Fund, (8 of the"
"4502","portfolios constituting the Principal Funds, Inc. (collectively the Funds)"
"4503","as of and for the period ended August 31, 2012, in accordance with the"
"4504","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"4505","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"4506","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"4507","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"4508","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"4509","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"4510","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"4511","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"4512","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"4513","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"4514","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal"
"4515","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"4516","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"4517","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"4518","generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over"
"4519","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"4520","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"4521","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"4522","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"4523","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"4524","generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures"
"4525","of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"4526","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"4527","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"4528","disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"4529","financial statements."
"4530","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"4531","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"4532","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"4533","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"4534","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4535","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"4536","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"4537","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"4538","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"4539","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"4540","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"4541","misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"4542","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"4543","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"4544","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"4545","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"4546","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"4547","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"4548","in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"4549","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"4550","material weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2012."

"6615","broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and"
"6616","research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either"

"6618","Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to each Series as"
"6619","well as to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion."

"6889","SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT"
"6890","AGREEMENT executed as of February 3, 2012, by and between PRINCIPAL MANAGEMENT"
"6891","CORPORATION, an Iowa corporation (hereinafter called the Manager), and"
"6892","SYMPHONY ASSET MANAGEMENT LLC, a California Limited Liability Company"
"6893","(hereinafter called the Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each Fund of the
Principal  Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the 1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it with the
investment advisory services for a certain designated portion of the assets in
each series identified in Appendix A (hereinafter called the Series), which
the Manager has agreed to provide to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to
furnish such services with respect to such assets; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies properly
certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly provide
the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated of any
amendment or supplement thereto:

(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) with the Fund;

 (b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

 (c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the Board
of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services provided by
the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the Manager
hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services described in
Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of the securities and
other assets of the Series subject to the control and direction of the
Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for the period and on the terms
hereinafter set forth. The Manager grants the Sub-Advisor full discretion
to perform such services.  The Sub-Advisor accepts such appointment and
agrees to furnish the services hereinafter set forth for the compensation
herein provided. The Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be deemed
to be an independent contractor and shall, except as expressly provided or
authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the Fund or the
Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the
Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services relating to the assets allocated
to it.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or any
appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time to time as
economic conditions require, a recommended investment program for the
Fund consistent with the Series' investment objective and policies,,

(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing discretionary
orders for the purchase and sale of securities without prior
consultation with the Manager and without regard to the length of time
the securities have been held, the resulting rate of portfolio
turnover or any tax considerations, subject always to the provisions
of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, the requirements
of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be from time to time in
effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the
officers, in taking such steps as are reasonably necessary or
appropriate to carry out the decisions of its Board of Directors, and
any appropriate committees of such Board, regarding the general
conduct of the investment business of the Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment advisory
services provided to the Series, its compliance with the 1940 Act and
the regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission
thereunder and the Series' investment strategies and restrictions as
stated in the Fund's prospectus and statement of additional
information as such statement may be amended from time to  time,
subject to receipt of such additional information as may be required
from the Manager and provided in accordance with Section 11(d) of this
Agreement. The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the maintenance
of Fund records except insofar as is directly related to the services
it provides to the Series.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in such
detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem appropriate in
order to enable it to determine that the investment policies,
procedures and approved investment program of the Series are being
observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of the fair
value of certain securities when reliable market quotations are not
readily available for purposes of calculating net asset value in
accordance with procedures and methods established by the Fund's Board
of Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other
personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii)
administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical personnel
and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of its duties under
this Agreement.

(i)	Select broker-dealers, banks, loan  traders and futures commission
merchants (broker-dealers),  to effect all transactions for the
Series, place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers
(including affiliated broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if
applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or
sell orders for the Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous
purchase or sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such
event allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as the
expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Sub-Advisor
in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the most equitable and
consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other
clients.  The Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure
may limit the size of the position that may be acquired or sold for
the Series.  The Sub-Advisor will report on such allocations at the
request of the Manager, the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors
providing such information as the number of aggregated trades to which
the Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades were
directed and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated trades.
The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of
transactions for the Series at prices in accordance with its duty of
best execution and at commission rates that are reasonable in relation
to the benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers
or dealers on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or other
services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with
applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount
of commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the
amount of commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would
have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor
determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable
in relation to the value of the brokerage and research products and/or
services provided by such broker or dealer. This determination, with
respect to brokerage and research products and/or services, may be
viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with
respect to the Series as well as to accounts over which they exercise
investment discretion. Not all such services or products need be used
by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the Series as
are required of an investment advisor of a registered investment
company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment Advisers Act of 1940
(the Investment Advisers Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish
the Fund and the Manager with such periodic and special reports as the
Fund or Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with the
requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby
agrees that all records that it maintains for the Series are the
property of the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by
Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the
Fund and that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the
1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any
records that it maintains for the Series upon request by the Fund or
the Manager, provided that the Manager may retain one copy of  all
such records..

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Sub-
Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as the same may
be amended from time to time.  The Manager acknowledges receipt of a
copy of Sub-Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall
promptly forward to the Manager a copy of any material amendment to
the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request, furnish the
requesting party reports on portfolio transactions and reports on
investments held by the Series, all in such detail as the Manager or
the Fund may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor will make available
its officers and employees to meet with the Fund's Board of Directors
at the Fund's principal place of business on due notice to review the
investments of the Series.

(m)	Provide such information reasonably requested by the Fund or the
Manager as is customarily provided by a sub-advisor and may be
required for the Fund or the Manager to comply with their respective
obligations under applicable laws, including, without limitation, the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act,
the Investment Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and any rule or
regulation thereunder.  Sub-Advisor will advise Manager of any changes
in Sub-Advisor's Senior Management (i.e. Chief Investment Officer and
Chief Executive Officer) within a reasonable time after any such
change.  Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-Advisor's Form ADV more
than 48 hours prior to the execution of this Agreement.

(n)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies solicited and
corporate actions by or with respect to, the issuers of securities
held in the Series, but for clarification, not the processing of class
action claims or settlements.  The Manager shall cause to be forwarded
to Sub-Advisor all proxy solicitation and corporate action materials
that it receives and shall assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to
conduct the proxy voting and corporate action process.

    3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-Advisor
will not consult with any other investment advisory firm that provides
investment advisory services to any investment company sponsored by
Principal Life Insurance Company regarding transactions for the Fund in
securities or other assets.

    4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations assumed by
the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the Fund, the Manager shall pay
the compensation specified in Appendix A to this Agreement.

    5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, the Fund or its
shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the Fund resulting
from any error of judgment made in the good faith exercise of the
Sub-Advisor's duties under this Agreement or as a result of the failure by
the Manager or any of its affiliates to comply with the terms of this
Agreement except for losses resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith
or gross negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of the
Sub-Advisor or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents
(excluding any broker-dealer selected by the Sub-Advisor), or affiliates.

    6.	Indemnification

The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sub-Advisor from and
against any and all claims, losses, liabilities or damages (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and other related expenses), (Losses)
howsoever arising, from or in connection with this Agreement or the
performance by the Sub-Advisor of its duties hereunder, so long as the
Sub-Advisor shall, after receipt of notice of any claim or commencement of
any action, promptly notify the Manager in writing of the claim or
commencement of such action.  The Manager shall not be liable for any
settlement of any claim or action effected without its written consent.
Nothing contained herein shall require the Manager to indemnify the Sub-
Advisor for Losses resulting from the Sub-Advisor's willful misfeasance,
bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or from its
reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.

    7.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons affiliated
with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third parties to better enable
the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement for the
provision of certain personnel, non-investment, operational or compliance
processes, and facilities to the Sub- Advisor.  Any arrangements to
provide investment advisory services in connection with the Fund's
securities will be subject to written notification to and approval of the
Manager and, where required by applicable law the Board of Directors of
the Fund.

8. Services to Others

The Sub-Advisor may act as a portfolio manager or sub-advisor to other
funds and discretionary accounts in addition to the Series. If the
availability of any particular investment security is limited and that
asset is consistent with the Series investment objectives and policies and
also the investment objectives, investment strategies and investment
restrictions of one or more of the Sub-Advisor's other accounts, such

regard to whether the assets are currently held in any of the relevant
investment portfolios, the relevant size and of the Series and other
accounts managed or sub-advised by the Sub-Advisor and any other factors
which the Sub-Advisor considers reasonable. The Sub-Advisor shall not be
obligated to present any particular investment opportunity to the Series

pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.

    10.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement

unless otherwise terminated, shall continue in effect for a period of two
years and thereafter from year to year provided that the continuance is
specifically approved at least annually either by the Board of Directors
of the Fund or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities of the Series and in either event by a vote of a majority of
the Board of Directors of the Fund who are not interested persons of the
Manager, Principal Life Insurance Company, the Sub-Advisor or the Fund
cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such
approval.

If the Board of Directors or the shareholders of a Series fail to approve
the Agreement or any continuance of the Agreement in accordance with the
requirements of the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will continue to act as Sub-
Advisor with respect to the Series pending the required approval of the
Agreement or its continuance or of any contract with the Sub-Advisor or a
different manager or Sub-Advisor or other definitive action; provided,
that the compensation received by the Sub-Advisor in respect to the Series
during such period is in compliance with Rule 15a-4 under the 1940 Act.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time without the payment of any
penalty by the Board of Directors of the Fund or by the Sub-Advisor, the
Manager or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of
the Series on sixty days written notice. This Agreement shall
automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. In interpreting
the provisions of this Section 10, the definitions contained in Section
2(a) of the 1940 Act (particularly the definitions of interested person,
assignment and voting security) shall be applied. In either case,  any
open trades which have not settled on the effective date of termination
will settle for the account of the Fund. .

if required by the 1940 Act or the rules, regulations, interpretations or
orders issued thereunder, by vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Series and by vote of a majority of
the Board of Directors of the Fund who are not interested persons of the

compensation for all services provided under this Agreement, a fee, computed
and paid monthly, at an annual rate as shown below of the Series' average daily

investment mandate as the series for which the fee is calculated, will be
combined with the assets of the series to arrive at net assets.
