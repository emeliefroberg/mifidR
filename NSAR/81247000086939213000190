"727","the year ended October 31, 2013, in accordance with the"

"747","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"748","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"749","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"750","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"751","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"752","financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"753","and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"754","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"755","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"756","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"757","or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material"
"758","effect on the financial statements."
"759","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"760","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"761","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"762","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"763","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"764","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"765","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"766","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"767","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"768","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"769","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"770","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"771","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"772","material misstatement of a Funds annual or interim financial"
"773","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"774","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"775","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"776","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"777","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"778","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"779","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"780","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its"
"781","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"782","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"783","October 31, 2013."
"784","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"785","management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam Convertible"
"786","Securities Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and"

"788","than these specified parties."
