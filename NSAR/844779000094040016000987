"834","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"835","To the Board of Trustees of BlackRock Funds and the Shareholders of"
"836","BlackRock Alternative Capital Strategies Fund:"
"837","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"838","BlackRock"
"839","Alternative Capital Strategies Fund (comprising BlackRock Funds,"
"840","hereafter"
"841","referred to as the Fund) as of and for the period ended December"
"842","31, 2015, in"
"843","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"844","Oversight Board"
"845","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"846","financial"
"847","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"848","basis for"
"849","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"850","opinion on"
"851","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"852","N-SAR, but"
"853","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"854","the Fund's"
"855","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not"
"856","express an"
"857","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"858","financial"
"859","reporting."
"860","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"861","maintaining"
"862","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"863","this"
"864","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"865","assess"
"866","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's"
"867","internal control"
"868","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"869","assurance"
"870","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"871","of"
"872","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"873","generally"
"874","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over"
"875","financial"
"876","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"877","the"
"878","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"879","fairly"
"880","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"881","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"882","necessary to"
"883","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"884","generally"
"885","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"886","the fund"
"887","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"888","and"
"889","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"890","prevention"
"891","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"892","of a fund's"
"893","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"894","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"895","reporting"
"896","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"897","evaluation of"
"898","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls"
"899","may"
"900","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"901","degree of"
"902","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"903","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"904","the"
"905","design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"906","employees, in the"
"907","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"908","detect"
"909","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"910","or a"
"911","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"912","reporting, such"
"913","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"914","of the"
"915","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"916","or detected"
"917","on a timely basis."
"918","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"919","reporting was"
"920","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"921","not"
"922","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over"
"923","financial"
"924","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"925","established by the"
"926","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However,"
"927","we noted no"
"928","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"929","and their"
"930","operation, including controls over"
"931","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses"
"932","as defined"
"933","above as of December 31, 2015."
"934","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"935","management and"
