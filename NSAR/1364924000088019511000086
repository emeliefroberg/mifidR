The Adviser is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio which is in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Adviser determines in good faith that such"
"4851","amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such"
"4852","broker or dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment"
"4853","discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if"
"4854","the commissions paid over representative periods of time were reasonable in relation to the benefits to the Portfolio."

In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to the Portfolio and/or the other accounts over which"
"6384","the Sub-Subadviser, Sub-Adviser, Adviser or their affiliates exercise investment discretion.  The Sub-Subadviser is"

"6388","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or"
"6389","dealer.  This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities"
"6390","which the Sub-Subadviser and its affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  The Trustees of the Fund shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the"

"6840","Portfolio which is in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"6841","effecting that transaction if the Sub-Subadvisor determines in good faith that such amount of commission is"

The Sub-Subadvisory Fee shall be equal to 110% of the Sub-Subadvisor's costs incurred in connection with rendering the services referred to in subparagraph (a) of paragraph 1 of this Agreement.

In selecting brokers or dealers qualified to execute a particular transaction, brokers or dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of"
"7380","1934) to the Portfolio and/or to the other accounts over which the Sub-Subadvisor, Sub-Advisor, or Advisor"
"7381","exercise investment discretion.  The Sub-Subadvisor is authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides"
"7382","such brokerage and research services a commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Portfolio"
"7383","which is in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting"
"7384","that transaction if the Sub-Subadvisor determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer.  This"
"7385","determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities"
"7386","which the Sub-Subadvisor has with respect to accounts over which it exercises investment discretion.  The"
"7387","Trustees of the Trust shall periodically review the commissions paid by the Portfolio to determine if the"

"7394","Agreement, the Sub-Advisor agrees to pay the Sub-Subadvisor a monthly Sub-Subadvisory Fee.  The Sub-Subadvisory Fee shall be equal to 110% of the Sub-Subadvisor's costs incurred in connection with rendering the services referred to in subparagraph (a) of paragraph 1 of this Agreement.

"7397","</P>"
"7398","<P ALIGN=LEFT>	(b) <I><U>Investment Management Fee</U></I>:  For services provided under subparagraph (b) of paragraph 1 of"
"7399","this Agreement, the Sub-Advisor agrees to pay the Sub-Subadvisor a monthly Investment Management Fee."
"7400","The Investment Management Fee shall be equal to: (i) 0.32% multiplied by: (ii) the fraction equal to the net"
"7401","assets of the Portfolio as to which the Sub-Subadvisor shall have provided investment management services"
"7402","divided by the net assets of the Portfolio for that month; provided, however, that the Investment Management Fee paid to the Sub-Subadvisor for any period hereunder shall in all circumstances be an amount not"
"7403","less than 110% of the Sub-Subadvisor 's costs incurred in connection with rendering the services referred to"

"7406","herein as the &quot;Minimum Investment Management Fee&quot;).  If in any fiscal year the aggregate expenses of the"
"7407","Portfolio exceed any applicable expense limitation imposed by any state or federal securities laws or regulations, and the Sub-Advisor waives all or a portion of its management fee or reimburses the Portfolio for"
"7408","expenses to the extent required to satisfy such limitation, the Investment Management Fee paid to the Sub-Subadvisor will be reduced by 50% of the amount of such waivers or reimbursements multiplied by the"
"7409","fraction determined in (ii), subject to the Minimum Investment Management Fee.  If the Sub-Subadvisor"
"7410","reduces its fees to reflect such waivers or reimbursements and the Sub-Advisor subsequently recovers all or"
"7411","any portion of such waivers or reimbursements, then the Sub-Subadvisor shall be entitled to receive from"

"8374","may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and"
"8375","efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes"
"8376","brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such"

"13233","Trust's Board of Trustees, the Advisor, or the Sub-Advisor may reasonably"
"13234","request from time to time, or as the Sub-Advisor may deem to be desirable. </P>"
"13235","<P align=left>3. <U>Brokerage</U>: In connection with the services provided"

"13237","shall place all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the"
"13238","Portfolio's account with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Subadvisor,"
"13239","which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with the Advisor, Sub-Advisor,"

"13241","execute portfolio transactions at prices which are advantageous to the Portfolio"
"13242","and at commission rates which are reasonable in relation to the benefits"

"13447","<P></P>"
"13448","<P>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements Fidelity"
"13449","Rutland Square Trust II: Strategic Advisers Core Income Fund, Strategic Advisers"
"13450","Emerging Markets Fund, Strategic Advisers Income Opportunities Fund, Strategic"
"13451","Advisors International Fund, Strategic Advisers International II Fund, Strategic"
"13452","Advisers Small Mid Cap Fund  Strategic Advisers US Opportunity Fund and"
"13453","Strategic Advisers U.S. Opportunity II Fund (collectively, the Trust) as of"
"13454","and for the year ended February 28, 2011, in accordance with the standards of"
"13455","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"13456","Trust's internal control over financial reporting, including control activities"
"13457","for safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"13458","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"13459","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"13460","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over"
"13461","financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"13462","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting.</P>"
"13463","<P>The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"13464","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"13465","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"13466","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"13467","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"13468","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"13469","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"13470","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"13471","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"13472","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"13473","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"13474","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"13475","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"13476","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Trust are being"
"13477","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"13478","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"13479","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a Trust's assets"
"13480","that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"13481","<P>Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"13482","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"13483","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"13484","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"13485","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"

"13491","<P></P>"
"13492","<P></P>"
"13493","<P>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"13494","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"13495","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"13496","misstatements on a timely basis. material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"13497","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"13498","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"13499","Trust's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"13500","on a timely basis.</P>"
"13501","<P>Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting"
"13502","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"13503","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"13504","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"13505","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"13506","deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"13507","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"13508","be material weaknesses as defined above as of February 28, 2011.</P>"
