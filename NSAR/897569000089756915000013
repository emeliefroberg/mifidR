"393","<p style=margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;><font face=eyinterstate light lang=EN-US style=font-size:9.0pt;>In planning and performing our audit of the"
"394","financial statements of Dreyfus Worldwide Growth Fund (the sole series"
"395","comprising Dreyfus Premier Worldwide Growth Fund, Inc.) (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of"
"396","and for the year ended October 31, 2015, in accordance with the standards of"
"397","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"398","Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"399","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"400","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"401","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"402","opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial"
"403","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.&#160; </font></p>"
"404","<p style=margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;><font face=eyinterstate light lang=EN-US style=font-size:9.0pt;>&nbsp;</font></p>"
"405","<p style=margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;><font face=eyinterstate light lang=EN-US style=font-size:9.0pt;>The management of the Company is responsible"
"406","for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"407","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"408","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"409","controls. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"410","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"411","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"412","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal"
"413","control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"414","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"415","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"416","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"417","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"418","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"419","the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"420","and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"421","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"422","of a company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"423","statements.</font></p>"
"424","<p style=margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;><font face=eyinterstate light lang=EN-US style=font-size:9.0pt;>&nbsp;</font></p>"
"425","<p style=margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;><font face=eyinterstate light lang=EN-US style=font-size:9.0pt;>Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"426","control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"427","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"428","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"429","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"430","deteriorate.</font></p>"
"431","<p style=margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;><font face=eyinterstate light lang=EN-US style=font-size:9.0pt;>&nbsp;</font></p>"
"432","<p style=margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;><font face=eyinterstate light lang=EN-US style=font-size:9.0pt;>A deficiency in internal control over"
"433","financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"434","allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"435","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"436","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"437","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"438","possibility that a material misstatement of the company&#8217;s annual or interim"
"439","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. </font></p>"

"442","control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the"
"443","first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"444","control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"445","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"446","deficiencies in the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting and its"
"447","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"448","be a material weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2015.</font></p>"
