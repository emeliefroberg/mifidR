"616","Agreement and Plan of Reorganization"
"617","THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the Agreement)"
"618","is made as of this 27th day of July, 2010, by and among"
"619","Credit Suisse High Yield Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation"
"620","(the Acquired Fund), Credit Suisse Opportunity Funds, a"
"621","Delaware statutory trust (the Trust), with respect to its"
"622","series, Credit Suisse High Income Fund (the Acquiring
Fund, and together with the Acquired Fund, the Funds),"
"623","and, solely for purposes of Sections 4.3, 5.9 and 9.2"
"624","hereof, Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC, a limited"
"625","liability company organized under the laws of the State"
"626","of Delaware (Credit Suisse)."
"627","This Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan"
"628","of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of"
"629","the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code)."
"630","The reorganization of the Acquired Fund"
"631","(the Reorganization) will consist of the transfer of all"
"632","of the assets of the Acquired Fund in exchange solely for"
"633","Common Class shares (collectively, the Shares) of the"
"634","Acquiring Fund and the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of"
"635","all of the liabilities of the Acquired Fund, and the"
"636","distribution, on or after the Closing Date hereinafter"
"637","referred to, of Shares of the Acquiring Fund (Acquiring
Fund Shares) to the shareholders of the Acquired Fund"
"638","in liquidation of the Acquired Fund as provided herein,"
"639","all upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth"
"640","in this Agreement."
"641","WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Acquired Fund has"
"642","determined that the exchange of all of the assets of the"
"643","Acquired Fund for Acquiring Fund Shares and the assumption"
"644","of the liabilities of the Acquired Fund by the Acquiring"
"645","Fund is in the best interests of the Acquired Fund and"
"646","that the interests of the existing shareholders of the"
"647","Acquired Fund would not be diluted as a result of this"
"648","transaction; and"
"649","WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees of the Trust, with respect"
"650","to the Acquiring Fund, has determined that the exchange of"
"651","all of the assets of the Acquired Fund for Acquiring Fund"
"652","Shares is in the best interests of the Acquiring Fund's"
"653","shareholders and that the interests of the existing"
"654","shareholders of the Acquiring Fund would not be diluted as"
"655","a result of this transaction."
"656","NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the"
"657","covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties"
"658","hereto covenant and agree as follows:"
"659","1. 	Transfer of Assets of the Acquired Fund in Exchange"
"660","for Acquiring Fund Shares and Assumption of the Acquired"
"661","Fund's Liabilities and Liquidation of the Acquired Fund"
"662","1.1. 	Subject to the terms and conditions herein set"
"663","forth and on the basis of the representations and warranties"
"664","contained herein, the Acquired Fund agrees to transfer its"
"665","assets as set forth in paragraph 1.2 to the Acquiring Fund,"
"666","and the Acquiring Fund agrees in exchange therefor: (i) to"
"667","deliver to the Acquired Fund the number of full and"
"668","fractional shares of each corresponding class of the"
"669","Acquiring Fund, determined by dividing the value of the"
"670","Acquired Fund's net assets attributable to each share"
"671","class of the Acquired Fund, computed in the manner and"
"672","as of the time and date set forth in paragraph 2.1, by the"
"673","net asset value of one Acquiring Fund Share of the"
"674","corresponding class (as set forth below); and (ii) to assume"
"675","the liabilities of the Acquired Fund, as set"
"676","forth in paragraph 1.3. Such transactions shall take place"
"677","at the closing provided for in paragraph 3.1 (the Closing
)."
"678","The class of shares of the Acquiring Fund correspond to the"
"679","class of shares of the Acquired Fund as follows: Common"
"680","Class shares of the Acquiring Fund correspond to"
"681","Institutional Class shares of the Acquired Fund."
"682","1.2. 	(a) The assets of the Acquired Fund to be acquired"
"683","by the Acquiring Fund shall consist of all property"
"684","including, without limitation, all cash, securities and"
"685","dividend or interest receivables that are owned by or"
"686","owed to the Acquired Fund and any deferred or prepaid"
"687","expenses shown as an asset on the books of the Acquired"
"688","Fund on the Closing date provided in paragraph 3.1"
"689","(the Closing Date)."
"690","	(b) The Acquired Fund has provided the Acquiring"
"691","Fund with a list of all of the Acquired Fund's assets as"
"692","of the date of execution of this Agreement. The Acquired"
"693","Fund reserves the right to sell any of these securities"
"694","but will not, without the prior approval of the Acquiring"
"695","Fund, acquire any additional securities other than"
"696","securities of the typein which the Acquiring Fund is"
"697","permitted to invest. The Acquired Fund will, within a"
"698","reasonable time prior to the Closing Date,"
"699","furnish the Acquiring Fund with a list of the securities,"
"700","if any, on the Acquired Fund's list referred to in the first"
"701","sentence of this paragraph which do not conform to the"
"702","Acquiring Fund's investment objective, policies and"
"703","restrictions. In the event that the Acquired Fund holds"
"704","any investments which the Acquiring Fund may not hold,"
"705","the Acquired Fund will dispose of such securities prior"
"706","to the Closing Date. In addition, if it is determined that"
"707","the portfolios of the Acquired Fund and the Acquiring Fund,"
"708","when aggregated, would contain investments exceeding"
"709","certain percentage limitations imposed upon the Acquiring"
"710","Fund with respect to such investments, the Acquired"
"711","Fund, if requested by the Acquiring Fund, will dispose of"
"712","and/or reinvest a sufficient amount of such investments as"
"713","may be necessary to avoid violating such limitations as of"
"714","the Closing Date."
"715","1.3. 	The Acquired Fund will endeavor to discharge all of"
"716","the known liabilities and obligations of the Acquired Fund"
"717","prior to the Closing Date, other than those liabilities and"
"718","obligations which would otherwise be discharged at a later"

"1321"," that"
"1322","there is reason to believe that the Indemnified Person will"
"1323"," ultimately be found to be entitled to indemnification."
"1324","5.8. 	The intention of the parties is that the transaction"

"1867","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1868","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"1869","Credit Suisse High Income Fund"
"1870","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1871","statements of Credit Suisse High Income Fund (a portfolio"
"1872","of the Credit Suisse Opportunity Funds) (the Fund) as"
"1873","of and for the year ended October 31, 2010, in accordance"
"1874","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1875","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"
"1876","internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1877","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1878","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1879","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1880","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"1881","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"1882","of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1883","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness"
"1884","of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1885","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"1886","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1887","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"1888","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1889","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's"
"1890","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"1891","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1892","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1893","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1894","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's"
"1895","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1896","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1897","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1898","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"1899","the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"1900","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1901","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1902","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1903","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1904","management and trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"1905","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1906","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets"
"1907","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1908","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1909","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1910","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1911","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1912","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1913","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1914","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1915","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"1916","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1917","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"1918","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1919","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1920","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1921","misstatement of the fund's annual or interim financial statements"
"1922","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1923","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1924","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1925","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"1926","in internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1927","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1928","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"1929","no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1930","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1931","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"1932","above as of October 31, 2010."
"1933","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1934","management and the Board of Trustees of Credit Suisse High Income"
"1935","Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"1936","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"1937","parties."
