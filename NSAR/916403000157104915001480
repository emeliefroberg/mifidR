"1639","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"1640","and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"1641","A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1642","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"1643","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"

"1645","and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"

"1647","<P STYLE=font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify>Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1648","control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"

"1650","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"

"1653","financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"

"1655","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
