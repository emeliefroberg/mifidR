"622","<DESCRIPTION>ACCOUNTANT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL"
"623","<TEXT>"
"624","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"625","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"626","Franklin Rising Dividends Fund"
"627","San Mateo, California"
"628","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"629","Franklin Rising Dividends Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year"
"630","ended September 30, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the"
"631","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"632","considered its internal control over financial reporting, including"
"633","control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"634","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"635","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"636","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"637","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"638","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"639","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"640","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.   In"
"641","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"642","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"643","controls.   A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"644","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"645","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"646","statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles"
"647","generally accepted in the United States of America.   Such internal"
"648","control includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable"
"649","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"650","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"651","material effect on the financial statements."
"652","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"653","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.   Also, projections"
"654","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"655","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"656","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"657","procedures may deteriorate."
"658","A control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control"
"659","does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"660","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"661","basis.   A significant deficiency is a control deficiency, or combination"
"662","of control deficiencies, that adversely affects the company's ability to"
"663","initiate, authorize, record, process or report financial data reliably in"
"664","accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United"
"665","States of America such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a"
"666","misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements that"
"667","is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. A material"
"668","weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant"
"669","deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a"
"670","material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will"
"671","not be prevented or detected."
"672","Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"673","Franklin Rising Dividends Fund"
"674","Page Two"
"675","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"676","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"677","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"678","significant deficiencies or material weaknesses under standards"
"679","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"680","(United States).   However,we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal"
"681","control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls for"
"682","safeguarding securities, which we consider to be material weaknesses, as"
"683","defined above, as of September 30, 2013."
"684","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management,"
"685","Shareholders and Board of Trustees of the Fund and the Securities and"
"686","Exchange Commission, and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"687","anyone other than these specified parties."
