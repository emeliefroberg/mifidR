"1538","  You may buy or redeem shares at their net asset"

"1541","cost method to value their portfolio securities. Using"
"1542","this method, a fund constantly amortizes over the"
"1543","remaining life of a security the difference between"
"1544","the principal amount due at maturity and the cost of"
"1545","the security to the fund. This method of valuation is"
"1546","designed to permit a money market fund to maintain"
"1547","a constant NAV of $1.00 per share, but there is no"
"1548","guarantee that it will do so."
"1549","  Each fund?s NAV per share is the value of its"
"1550","assets minus its liabilities divided by the number of"
"1551","shares outstanding. NAV is calculated separately for"
"1552","each class of shares. Each fund is open for business"
"1553","and calculates its NAV every day on which both the"
"1554","NYSE and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York"
"1555","(?FRBNY?) are open for business. Therefore, the"

"1561","also closed on weekends and may be closed because"
"1562","of an emergency or other unanticipated event. In the"
"1563","event the NYSE does not open for business because"
"1564","of an emergency or other unanticipated event, a"
"1565","fund may, but is not required to, open for purchase"
"1566","or redemption transactions if the Federal Reserve"
"1567","wire payment system is open."
"1568","  Each fund typically calculates its NAV as of each"
"1569","hour from 9:00 a.m. until its close of business on"
"1570","each fund business day. However, a fund could,"
"1571","without advance notice, determine not to make one"
"1572","or more intraday calculations for a number of"
"1573","reasons such as unusual conditions in the bond,"
"1574","credit or other markets or unusual fund purchase or"
"1575","redemption activity. If a fund determined not to"
"1576","make an intraday calculation, purchases or"

"1579","greater or less than the price at which the purchase or"

"1678","Reserves and Western Asset Institutional Liquid Reserves,"
"1679","(collectively the Funds), each a series of Legg Mason Partners"
"1680","Institutional Trust, as of and for the year ended August 31,"
"1681","2011, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1682","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"1683","Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1684","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1685","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1686","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1687","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1688","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"1689","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"1690","express no such opinion."
"1691","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1692","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1693","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1694","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1695","related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"1696","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1697","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1698","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1699","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1700","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1701","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1702","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1703","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1704","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1705","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1706","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1707","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"1708","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1709","and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1710","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1711","acquisition, use, or disposition of the fund's assets that could"
"1712","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1713","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1714","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1715","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1716","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1717","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1718","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1719","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1720","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1721","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1722","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"1723","a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"1724","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1725","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1726","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial"
"1727","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1728","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1729","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1730","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1731","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1732","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1733","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"1734","Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1735","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that"
"1736","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"1737","August 31, 2011."
