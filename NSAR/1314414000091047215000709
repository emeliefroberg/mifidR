"492","Trustees"
"493","Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"494","4020 South 147th Street"
"495","Omaha, Nebraska 68137"
"496","In planning and performing our"
"497","audit of the financial"
"498","statements of GMG Defensive"
"499","Beta Fund (the Fund), a"
"500","series of Northern Lights Fund"
"501","Trust as of and for the year"
"502","ended July 31, 2015, in"
"503","accordance with the standards"
"504","of the Public Company"
"505","Accounting Oversight Board"
"506","(United States), we considered"
"507","the Fund's internal control"
"508","over financial reporting,"
"509","including controls over"
"510","safeguarding securities, as a"
"511","basis for designing our"
"512","auditing procedures for the"
"513","purpose of expressing our"
"514","opinion on the financial"
"515","statements and to comply with"
"516","the requirements of Form N-"
"517","SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"518","expressing an opinion on the"
"519","effectiveness of the Fund's"
"520","internal control over financial"
"521","reporting.   Accordingly, we"
"522","express no such opinion."
"523","The management of the Fund"
"524","is responsible for establishing"
"525","and maintaining effective"
"526","internal control over financial"
"527","reporting.   In fulfilling this"
"528","responsibility, estimates and"
"529","judgments by management are"
"530","required to assess the expected"
"531","benefits and related costs of"
"532","controls.   A company's"
"533","internal control over financial"
"534","reporting is a process"
"535","designed to provide"
"536","reasonable assurance"
"537","regarding the reliability of"
"538","financial reporting and the"
"539","preparation of financial"
"540","statements for external"
"541","purposes in accordance with"
"542","generally accepted accounting"
"543","principles.   A company's"
"544","internal control over financial"
"545","reporting includes those"
"546","policies and procedures that"
"547","(1) pertain to the maintenance"
"548","of records that, in reasonable"
"549","detail, accurately and fairly"
"550","reflect the transactions and"
"551","dispositions of the assets of"
"552","the company; (2) provide"
"553","reasonable assurance that"
"554","transactions are recorded as"
"555","necessary to permit"
"556","preparation of financial"
"557","statements in accordance with"
"558","generally accepted accounting"
"559","principles, and that receipts"
"560","and expenditures of the"
"561","company are being made only"
"562","in accordance with"
"563","authorizations of management"
"564","and directors of the company;"
"565","and (3) provide reasonable"
"566","assurance regarding prevention"
"567","or timely detection of"
"568","unauthorized acquisition, use"
"569","or disposition of a company's"
"570","assets that could have a"
"571","material effect on the financial"
"572","statements."
"573","Because of inherent"
"574","limitations, internal control"
"575","over financial reporting may"
"576","not prevent or detect"
"577","misstatements.   Also,"
"578","projections of any evaluation"
"579","of effectiveness to future"
"580","periods are subject to the risk"
"581","that controls may become"
"582","inadequate because of"
"583","changes in conditions, or"
"584","that the degree of compliance"
"585","with the policies or procedures"
"586","may deteriorate."
"587","A deficiency in internal control"
"588","over financial reporting exists"
"589","when the design or operation"
"590","of a control does not allow"
"591","management or employees, in"
"592","the normal course of"
"593","performing their assigned"
"594","functions, to prevent or detect"
"595","misstatements on a timely"
"596","basis.   A material weakness is"
"597","a deficiency, or combination of"
"598","deficiencies, in internal control"
"599","over financial reporting, such"
"600","that there is a reasonable"
"601","possibility that a material"
"602","misstatement of the Fund's"
"603","annual or interim financial"
"604","statements will not be"
"605","prevented or detected on a"
"606","timely basis."

"611","Our consideration of the"
