"2227","(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and in such"
"2228","detail"
"2229","as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem appropriate in order to enable it"

"2231","program of each Series are being observed."
"2232","(g)	Upon request, provide assistance and recommendations for the determination"
"2233","of"
"2234","the fair value of certain securities when reliable market quotations are not"
"2235","readily available for purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance"
"2236","with procedures and methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors."
"2237","(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and management"
"2238","facilities, including salaries of clerical and other personnel required for it"
"2239","to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including"

dealers), select broker-dealers to effect all transactions for each Series,"
"2244","place all necessary orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated"

"2246","consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for each Series may be"
"2247","aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of other clients of the"
"2248","Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as"
"2249","well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the"
"2250","Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the most equitable"
"2251","and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients."
"2252"," The Sub-Advisor will report on such allocations at the request of the Manager,"
"2253","the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing such information as the"
"2254","number of aggregated trades to which each Series was a party, the broker-"
"2255","dealers to whom such trades were directed and the basis for the allocation for"
"2256","the aggregated trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain"
"2257","execution of transactions for each Series at prices which are advantageous to"
"2258","the Series and at commission rates that are reasonable in relation to the"
"2259","benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on"
"2260","the basis that they provide brokerage, research or other services or products"
"2261","to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-"
"2262","Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a"
"2263","securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread"
"2264","another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if"
"2265","the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of commission is"
"2266","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research products"
"2267","and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This determination, with"
"2268","respect to brokerage and research products and/or services, may be viewed in"
"2269","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities"
"2270","which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to each Series as"
"2271","well as to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all"
"2272","such services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the"
"2273","Series.  In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by"
"2274","the Series except to the extent permitted under any exemptive order obtained by"
"2275","the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions of such order are complied with."

"3383","distribution upon liquidation of any other series or class.  The assets so"
"3384","distributable to the shareholder of any particular series or class shall"
"3385","be distributed among such shareholders according to their respective"
"3386","rights taking into account the proper allocation of expenses being borne"

"3431","	Section 4.  Determination of Net Asset Value: The net asset value of each"
"3432","share of each series or class of each series of the Corporation shall be the"
"3433","quotient obtained by dividing the value of the net assets of the Corporation, or"
"3434","if applicable of the series or class (being the value of the assets of the"
"3435","Corporation or of the particular series or class or attributable to the"
"3436","particular series or class less its actual and accrued liabilities exclusive of"

"3444","accepted accounting principles.  The procedures may include, without limitation,"
"3445","procedures for valuation of the Corporation's portfolio securities and other"
"3446","assets, for accrual of expenses or creation of reserves and for the"
"3447","determination of the number of shares issued and outstanding at any given time."
"3448","	Section 5.  Redemption and Repurchase of Shares of Capital Stock:  Any"
"3449","shareholder may redeem shares of the Corporation for the net asset value of each"
"3450","series or class thereof by presentation of an appropriate request, together with"
"3451","the certificates, if any, for such shares, duly endorsed, at the office or"
"3452","agency designated by the Corporation.  Redemptions as aforesaid, or purchases by"
"3453","the Corporation of its own stock, shall be made in the manner and subject to the"
"3454","conditions contained in the bylaws or approved by the Board of Directors."
"3455","	Section 6.  Purchase of Shares:  The Corporation shall be entitled to"

"4519","purposes as the Boards of Directors may deem appropriate.  The Board of"
"4520","Directors shall have the power, in its sole discretion, to distribute in"
"4521","any fiscal year as dividends, including dividends designated in whole or"
"4522","in part as capital gains distributions, amounts sufficient, in the opinion"
"4523","of the Board of Directors, to enable the Corporation, or where applicable"
"4524","each series of shares or class of a series, to qualify as a regulated"
"4525","investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or"
"4526","any successor or comparable statute thereto, and regulations promulgated"

"4535","Board of Directors, the excess of the assets belonging to that series or"
"4536","class over the liabilities belonging to that series or class.  The holders"
"4537","of shares of any series or class shall not be entitled thereby to any"
"4538","distribution upon liquidation of any other series or class.  The assets so"
"4539","distributable to the shareholder of any particular series or class shall"
"4540","be distributed among such shareholders according to their respective"
"4541","rights taking into account the proper allocation of expenses being borne"
"4542","by that series or class.  The liquidation of assets attributable to any"
"4543","particular series or class in which there are shares then outstanding and"
"4544","the termination of the series or the class may be authorized by vote of a"
"4545","majority of the Board of Directors then in office, without action or"
"4546","approval of the shareholders, to the extent consistent with applicable"
"4547","laws and regulation.  In the event that there are any general assets not"
"4548","belonging to any particular series or class of stock and available for"
"4549","distribution, such distribution shall be made to holders of stock of"
"4550","various series or classes in such proportion as the Board of Directors"
"4551","determines to be fair and equitable, and such determination by the Board"
"4552","of Directors shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes."

"4555","Article V, Section 5."
"4556","	(d)	The Corporation's shares of stock are issued and sold, and all"
"4557","persons who shall acquire stock of the Corporation shall do so, subject to"
"4558","the condition and understanding that the provisions of the Corporation's"
"4559","Articles of Incorporation, as from time to time amended, shall be binding"
"4560","upon them."
"4561","	Section 2.  Quorum Requirements and Voting Rights:  Except as otherwise"
"4562","expressly provided by the Maryland General Corporation Law, the presence in"

"4566","series or class are required or permitted to vote as a series or class, one-"
"4567","third of the aggregate number of shares of that series or class outstanding and"
"4568","entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum."
"4569","	Notwithstanding any provision of Maryland General Corporation Law requiring a"
"4570","greater proportion than a majority of the votes of all series or classes or of"
"4571","any series or class of the Corporation's stock entitled to be cast in order to"
"4572","take or authorize any action, any such action may be taken or authorized upon"

"4574","cast thereon subject to the applicable laws and regulations as from time to time"
"4575","in effect or rules or orders of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any"
"4576","successor thereto.  All shares of stock of this Corporation shall have the"

"5197","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"5198","The Shareholders and Board of Directors"
"5199","Principal Funds, Inc."
"5200","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Bond"
"5201","Market Index Fund, Diversified Real Asset Fund, International Equity Index"
"5202","Fund, Preferred Securities Fund and Small-MidCap Dividend Income Fund, (5 of"
"5203","the portfolios constituting the Principal Funds, Inc. (collectively the"
"5204","Funds)) as of and for the period ended August 31, 2011, in accordance with"
"5205","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"5206","States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"5207","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"5208","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"5209","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"5210","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"5211","Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"5212","such opinion."
"5213","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"5214","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"5215","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"5216","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal"
"5217","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"5218","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"5219","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"5220","generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over"
"5221","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"5222","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"5223","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"5224","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"5225","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"5226","generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures"
"5227","of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"5228","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"5229","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"5230","disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"5231","financial statements."
"5232","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"5233","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"5234","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"5235","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"5236","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5237","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"5238","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"5239","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"5240","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"5241","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"5242","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"5243","misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not"
"5244","be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"5245","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"5246","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"5247","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"5248","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"5249","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"5250","in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"5251","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"5252","material weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2011."
"5253","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"5254","the Board of Directors of the Funds and the Securities and Exchange"
"5255","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"5256","than these specified parties."
