"3672","control over financial reporting."
"3673","Accordingly, we express no such"
"3674","opinion."
"3675","The management of the Funds is"
"3676","responsible for establishing and"
"3677","maintaining effective internal control"
"3678","over financial reporting.   In fulfilling"
"3679","this responsibility, estimates and"
"3680","judgments by management are required"
"3681","to assess the expected benefits and"
"3682","related costs of controls.   A companys"
"3683","internal control over financial reporting"
"3684","is a process designed to provide"
"3685","reasonable assurance regarding the"
"3686","reliability of financial reporting and the"
"3687","preparation of financial statements for"
"3688","external purposes in accordance with"
"3689","generally accepted accounting"
"3690","principles.   A companys internal control"
"3691","over financial reporting includes those"
"3692","policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"3693","to the maintenance of records that, in"
"3694","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"3695","reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"3696","of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"3697","reasonable assurance that transactions"
"3698","are recorded as necessary to permit"
"3699","preparation of financial statements in"
"3700","accordance with generally accepted"
"3701","accounting principles, and that receipts"

"3708","unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"3709","disposition of a companys assets that"
"3710","could have a material effect on the"
"3711","financial statements."
"3712","Because of inherent limitations, internal"
"3713","control over financial reporting may not"
"3714","prevent or detect misstatements.   Also,"
"3715","projections of any evaluation of"
"3716","effectiveness to future periods are"
"3717","subject to the risk that controls may"
"3718","become inadequate because of changes"
"3719","in conditions, or that the degree of"
"3720","compliance with the policies or"
"3721","procedures may deteriorate."
"3722","A deficiency in internal control over"
"3723","financial reporting exists when the"
"3724","design or operation of a control does not"
"3725","allow management or employees, in the"
"3726","normal course of performing their"
"3727","assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3728","misstatements on a timely basis.   A"
"3729","material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"3730","combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"3731","control over financial reporting, such"
"3732","that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"3733","a material misstatement of the companys"
"3734","annual or interim financial statements"
"3735","will not be prevented or detected on a"
"3736","timely basis."
"3737","Our consideration of the Funds internal"
"3738","control over financial reporting was for"
"3739","the limited purpose described in the first"
"3740","paragraph and would not necessarily"

"3743","weaknesses under standards established"
"3744","by the Public Company Accounting"
"3745","Oversight Board (United States)."
