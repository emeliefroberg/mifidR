"680","as of and for the year ended March 31, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"681","(United States), we considered the Funds&rsquo; internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"682","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"

"689","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting"

"694","with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"695","directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"696","use or disposition of a fund&rsquo;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
