"4537","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"4538","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"4539","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"4540","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"4541","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"4542","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"4543","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"4544","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"4545","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"4546","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"4547","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"4548","fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"4549","and trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"4550","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"4551","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"4552","statements."
"4553","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"4554","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"4555","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"4556","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"4557","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"4558","procedures may deteriorate."
"4559","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"4560","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"4561","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"4562","or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"4563","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"4564","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"4565","a material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements"
"4566","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"4567","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"4568","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"4569","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"4570","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"4571","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we"
"4572","noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"4573","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"4574","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of October 31, 2009."

"4676","1.1.	It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Reorganization"
"4677","described herein shall be conducted separately of the others, and a party"
"4678","hereto which is not a party to a Reorganization shall incur no obligations,"
"4679","duties or liabilities with respect to such Reorganization by reason of being"

"4701","IDFI Portfolio, to the extent appropriate), will declare and pay to its"
"4702","shareholders of record one or more dividends and/or other distributions so"
"4703","that it will have distributed substantially all (and in no event less than"
"4704","98%) of its investment company taxable income (computed without regard to"
"4705","any deduction for dividends paid) and realized net capital gain, if any, for"
"4706","the current taxable year through the Closing Date."
"4707","1.4.	Provided that all conditions precedent to a Reorganization have been"
"4708","satisfied as of the Closing Date and based on the representations and"
"4709","warranties each party herein provides to the others, the Trust or Advisor"
"4710","Trust and Franklin Trust or Franklin NY Trust, as appropriate, agree to take"

"4714","(a)	The Target Fund shall transfer all of its Assets, as defined and set"
"4715","forth in Paragraph 1.4(b), to the corresponding Acquiring Fund, and the"
"4716","Acquiring Fund in exchange therefore shall deliver to the Target Fund the"

"4718","and as of the time on the Closing Date set forth in Paragraph 2."
"4719","(b)	The assets of the Target Fund to be acquired by the Acquiring Fund"
"4720","shall consist of all assets and property, including, without limitation, all"
"4721","cash, securities, commodities and futures interests, claims (whether absolute"
"4722","or contingent, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued and including, without"

"4726","government-established investor recovery fund claims, and any and all"
"4727","resulting recoveries) and dividends or interest receivable that are owned by"
"4728","the Target Fund and any deferred or prepaid expenses shown as an asset on"

"4730","deposits or cash equivalent securities in an estimated amount necessary to"
"4731","(i) discharge the Target Fund's unpaid liabilities on the Target Fund's"
"4732","books at the Closing Date and (ii) pay such contingent liabilities, if any,"
"4733","as the Board of Trustees of the Trust or Advisor Trust, as applicable,"
"4734","shall reasonably deem to exist against the Target Fund at the Closing Date,"

"4751","rata basis within that class, and will completely liquidate (except as to"
"4752","the contingent liability reserve provided for in Paragraph 1.4(b) herein)."
"4753","Such distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with respect to"

"4755","Fund shares of the corresponding class then credited to the account of"
"4756","the Target Fund on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the"
"4757","share records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the Target Fund"
"4758","Shareholders of the class.  The aggregate net asset value of each class"
"4759","of shares of the Acquiring Fund to be so credited to the corresponding"
"4760","class or classes of Target Fund Shareholders shall be equal to the"
"4761","aggregate net asset value of the Target Fund's shares of the corresponding"
"4762","class or classes owned by the Target Fund Shareholders on the Closing Date"
"4763","(as set forth in Exhibit A).  All issued and outstanding shares of the"
"4764","Target Fund will simultaneously be canceled on the books of the Target Fund."

"4773","any Federal, state or local tax authorities or any other relevant regulatory"
"4774","authority, is and shall remain the responsibility of the Target Fund."

"4783","and provided to the Target Fund prior to the Closing Date."
"4784","(b)	The net asset value of each class of Acquiring Fund shares issued in"

"4788","prospectus and statement of additional information, and valuation"
"4789","procedures established by the Acquiring Fund's Board of Trustees."
"4790","(c)	The number of each class of Acquiring Fund shares issued (including"
"4791","fractional shares, if any) in exchange for the Target Fund's Assets shall be"
"4792","determined by dividing the value of the net assets with respect to each class"
"4793","of shares of the Target Fund determined using the same valuation procedures"
"4794","referred to in Paragraph 2.1(a), by the net asset value of an Acquiring Fund"
"4795","share of the corresponding class, as set forth in Exhibit A, determined in"
"4796","accordance with Paragraph 2.1(b)."
"4797","(d)	All computations of value shall be made by the Target Fund's"
