"690","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"691","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders"
"692","of Cohen & Steers Low Duration Preferred and Income Fund, Inc."
"693","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"694","of Cohen & Steers Low Duration Preferred and Income Fund, Inc."
"695","(the Fund) as of and for the year ended April 30, 2017, in"
"696","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"697","Oversight Board (United States),  we considered the Fund's"
"698","internal control over financial reporting, including  controls"
"699","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"700","auditing  procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"701","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"702","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"703","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"704","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"705","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"706","reporting."
"707","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"708","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"709","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"710","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"711","related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"712","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"713","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"714","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"715","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"716","A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"717","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"718","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"719","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"720","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"721","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"722","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"723","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"724","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"725","fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"726","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"727","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"728","statements."
"729","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"730","financial reporting may not"
"731","prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"732","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"733","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"734","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures"
"735","may deteriorate."
"736","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"737","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"738","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"

"781","Establishment of New Class F and Class T Shares"
"782","A Registration Statement filed with the Securities"
"783","and Exchange Commission on behalf of the Fund, effective"
"784","March 31, 2017, established two additional classes of"
"785","shares for the Fund designated as Class F and Class T"
"786","shares. In addition to the new Class F and T shares,"
"787","the Fund also has Class A, Class C, Class I, Class R"
"788","and Class Z shares. Class F shares are not subject to an"
"789","initial or contingent deferred sales charge or a Rule 12b-1"
"790","fee or shareholder servicing fee. Class T shares are subject"
"791","to a 2.50% initial sales charge, but are not subject to a"
"792","contingent deferred sales charge.  Class T shares are subject"
"793","to a Rule 12b-1 fee of 0.25% of the average daily value of the"
"794","Fund's net assets attributable to Class T shares, and a non-Rule"
"795","12b-1 shareholder service fee of up to 0.10% of the average daily"
"796","value of the Fund's net assets attributable to Class T shares."
"797","Class F and T shares are not currently available for purchase."
"798","Once available, Class F and T shares are available through financial"
"799","intermediaries that have a selling agreement with Cohen & Steers"
"800","Securities, LLC, the Fund's distributor."
"801","The Fund shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, have the"
"802","right, at its option, at any time to redeem shares owned by any"
"803","shareholder if the Board of Directors has determined that it is in the"
"804","best interest of the Fund to redeem its shares. The Fund's shares have"
"805","no preemptive or conversion rights.  Each class of shares represents an"
"806","interest in the same assets of the Fund and is identical in all respects"
"807","except that (i) each class is subject to different sales charges and"
"808","distributions and service fees, which may affect performance, and (ii)"
"809","each class has exclusive voting rights on any matter submitted to"
"810","shareholders that affects only that class, including any matter that"
"811","relates to that class' Distribution Plan and has separate voting rights"
"812","on any matter submitted to shareholders in which the interests of one"
"813","class differ from the interests of any other class. With the exceptions"
"814","noted above, all shares of the Fund have equal voting, dividend,"
"815","distribution and liquidation rights. All shares of the Fund, when duly"
"816","issued, will be fully paid and nonassessable. Shareholders are entitled"
"817","to one vote per share. All voting rights for the election of Directors"
"818","are noncumulative, which means that the holders of more than 50% of the"
"819","shares outstanding can elect 100% of the Directors then nominated for"
"820","election if they choose to do so and, in such event, the holders of the"
"821","remaining shares will not be able to elect any Directors. The foregoing"
"822","description is subject to the provisions contained in the Fund's Articles"
"823","of Incorporation and By-Laws as amended and supplemented from time-to-time."
"824","The Board of Directors is authorized to reclassify and issue any unissued"
"825","shares of the Fund without shareholder approval. Accordingly, in the future,"
"826","the Board of Directors may create additional series of shares with different"
"827","investment objectives, policies or restrictions. Any issuance of shares of"
"828","another class would be governed by the 1940 Act and Maryland law."
