"4931","AND LIQUIDATION OF THE ACQUIRED FUND"
"4932","1.1.	Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and on"
"4933","the basis of the representations and warranties"

"4937","the Acquiring Fund will acquire, on the Closing"
"4938","Date, all of the properties and assets of the"

"4940","(b)	In consideration therefor, the Acquiring Fund"
"4941","shall, on the Closing Date, (i) issue and"
"4942","deliver to the Acquired Fund the number of"
"4943","Acquiring Fund Shares (including fractional"

"4949","such shares, computed in the manner and as of"

"4964","in subsections (a) and (b) above, the Acquired"
"4965","Fund in complete liquidation shall distribute to"
"4966","its shareholders of record as of the Closing"
"4967","Date the Acquiring Fund Shares received by it."
"4968","Each Class A shareholder shall be entitled to"
"4969","receive on a pro rata basis that number of"
"4970","Acquiring Fund Shares equal to the total of (i)"
"4971","the number of Class A shares of the Acquired"
"4972","Fund (the Acquired Fund Shares) held by such"
"4973","shareholder divided by the number of such"
"4974","Acquired Fund Shares outstanding on such date"

"4976","Fund Shares."
"4977","1.2.	The property and assets of the Acquired Fund to be"
"4978","acquired by the Acquiring Fund shall include all of"

"4991","the Valuation Date, in accordance with accounting"
"4992","principles generally accepted in the United States"
"4993","of America consistently applied, from the prior"
"4994","audited period."
"4995","1.3.	As provided in Section 3.4, as soon after the"
"4996","Closing Date as is conveniently practicable (the"
"4997","Liquidation Date), the Acquired Fund will"
"4998","liquidate and distribute to its shareholders of"
"4999","record the Acquiring Fund Shares received by the"
"5000","Acquired Fund as contemplated by Section 1.1.  Such"
"5001","liquidation and distribution will be accomplished by"
"5002","the transfer of the Acquiring Fund Shares then"
"5003","credited to the account of the Acquired Fund on the"
"5004","books of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the"
"5005","share records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of"

"5015","Fund shareholder holding a certificate or"

"5017","any, on the Valuation Date (as defined below), the"
"5018","Acquiring Fund will not permit such shareholder to"
"5019","receive Acquiring Fund Share certificates therefor,"
"5020","exchange such Acquiring Fund Shares for shares of"
"5021","other series of the Acquiring Trust (or for shares"

"5025","Acquiring Fund Shares, or pledge or redeem such"
"5026","Acquiring Fund Shares until the Acquiring Fund has"
"5027","been notified by the Acquired Fund or its agent that"
"5028","such Acquired Fund shareholder has surrendered all"
"5029","his or her outstanding certificates for Acquired"
"5030","Fund Shares or, in the event of lost certificates,"
"5031","posted adequate bond."
"5032","1.5.	As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the"
"5033","Acquired Fund shall make all filings and take all"
"5034","other steps as shall be necessary and proper to"

"5038","up to and including the Closing Date and thereafter."
"5039","1.6.	Any and all obligations or liabilities arising under"

"6498","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"6499","To the Shareholders and"
"6500","Board of Trustees"
"6501","Of Highland Funds II Trust:"
"6502","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"6503","of the Highland U.S. Equity Fund (formerly, GE US Equity Fund),"
"6504","Highland Core Value Equity Fund (formerly, GE US Equity Fund),"
"6505","Highland Premier Growth Equity Fund (formerly, GE Premier Growth"
"6506","Equity Fund), Highland Small-Cap Equity Fund (formerly, GE"

"6513","Government Fund), Highland Tax-Exempt Fund (formerly, GE Tax-"
"6514","Exempt Fund), Highland Fixed Income Fund (formerly, GE Fixed"
"6515","Income Fund), Highland Money Market Fund II (formerly, GE Money"
"6516","Market Fund) and the Highland Trend Following Fund (formerly,"
"6517","Incline Capital Trend Following Fund), thirteen of the funds"
"6518","comprising the Highland Funds II Trust, as of and for the year"
"6519","or period ended September 30, 2011, in accordance with the"
"6520","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"6521","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"6522","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"6523","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"6524","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"6525","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"6526","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"6527","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"6528","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"6529","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"6530","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"6531","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"6532","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"6533","related costs of controls.  A company's internal control over"
"6534","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"6535","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"6536","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"6537","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"6538","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"6539","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"6540","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"6541","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"6542","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"6543","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"6544","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"6545","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"6546","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"6547","management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"6548","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"6549","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's"
"6550","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"6551","statements."
"6552","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"6553","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"6554","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"6555","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"6556","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"6557","of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"6558","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"6559","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"6560","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"6561","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"6562","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"6563","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"6564","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"6565","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial"
"6566","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"6567","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"6568","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"6569","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"6570","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"6571","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"6572","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"6573","Company's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"6574","operations, including controls over safeguarding securities that"
"6575","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"6576","September 30, 2011."
"6577","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"6578","management and the Board of Trustees of Highland Funds II Trust"
"6579","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"6580","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"6581","specified parties."
