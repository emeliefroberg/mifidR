"12586","sale of shares of stock of a particular class, together with all"

"12588","all income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof,"
"12589","including any proceeds derived from the sale, exchange or"
"12590","liquidation of such assets, and any funds or payments"
"12591","derived from any reinvestment of such proceeds, shall"
"12592","constitute assets of that class, in contrast to other classes"
"12593","(subject only to the rights of creditors) and are herein"
"12594","referred to as assets belonging to that class.  Any assets,"
"12595","income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof, funds or"

"12597","any particular class, shall be allocated by or under the"

"12599","or more of the classes established and designated from time"
"12600","to time, in such manner and on such basis as the Board of"

"12602","(b)	The Board of Directors may from time to time"

"12604","cash, on any or all classes of stock, giving due"

"12624","the extent that a net capital loss for a fiscal year offsets net"
"12625","capital gains from one or more of the other classes, any"
"12626","amount the Board of Directors deems available for"

"12669","of any shares redeemed or repurchased by it."
"12670","(6)	At all meetings of shareholders of the Corporation, each"

"12679","determines that any matter concerns only one or more particular"
"12680","classes, it may direct that only holders of that class or those classes"

"12858","valued at fair market value, as determined in good"
"12859","faith by or at the direction of the Board of Directors,"

"12874","cent, shall be the net asset value per share of that"

"12876","(iv)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of"
"12877","Directors may determine that the net asset value per"
"12878","share of any class or classes of stock should remain"

"13695","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"13696","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of VALIC Company I:"
"13697","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"13698","VALIC Company I (the Series) as of and for the year ended May 31,"
"13699","2011, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"13700","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Series'"
"13701","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"13702","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"13703","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"13704","to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"13705","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Series' internal"
"13706","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"13707","opinion on the effectiveness of the Series' internal control over financial"
"13708","reporting."
"13709","The management of the Series is responsible for establishing and"
"13710","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"13711","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"13712","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"13713","fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"13714","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"13715","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"13716","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"13717","A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"13718","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"13719","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"13720","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"13721","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"13722","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"13723","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made"
"13724","only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"13725","the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"13726","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"13727","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"13728","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"13729","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"13730","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"13731","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"13732","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"13733","deteriorate."
"13734","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"13735","design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"13736","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"13737","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"13738","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"13739","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"13740","that a material misstatement of the Series' annual or interim financial"
"13741","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"13742","Our consideration of the Series' internal control over financial reporting"
"13743","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"13744","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"13745","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"13746","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"13747","States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Series' internal control"
"13748","over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"13749","safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as"
"13750","defined above as of May 31, 2011."

"13752","and the Board of Directors of VALIC Company I and the Securities and"
"13753","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used"
