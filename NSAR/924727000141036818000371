"733","To the shareholders of FPA International Value Fund and"
"734","the Board of Trustees of FPA Funds Trust"
"735","Opinion on the Financial Statements and Financial"
"736","Highlights"
"737","We have audited the accompanying statement of assets"
"738","and liabilities of FPA International Value Fund, a series of"
"739","FPA Funds Trust, (the Fund), including the portfolio of"
"740","investments, as of December 31, 2017, the related"
"741","statement of operations for the year then ended, the"
"742","statements of changes in net assets for each of the two"
"743","years in the period then ended, the financial highlights for"
"744","each of the five years in the period then ended, and the"
"745","related notes. In our opinion, the financial statements and"
"746","financial highlights present fairly, in all material respects,"
"747","the financial position of the Fund as of December 31, 2017,"
"748","and the results of its operations for the year then ended,"
"749","the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in"
"750","the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each"
"751","of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity"
"752","with accounting principles generally accepted in the United"
"753","States of America."
"754","Basis for Opinion"
"755","These financial statements and financial highlights are the"
"756","responsibility of the Fund's management. Our"
"757","responsibility is to express an opinion on the Fund's"
"758","financial statements and financial highlights based on our"
"759","audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the"
"760","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"761","States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with"
"762","respect to the Fund in accordance with the U.S. federal"
"763","securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of"
"764","the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB."
"765","We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards"
"766","of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and"
"767","perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about"
"768","whether the financial statements and financial highlights"
"769","are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or"
"770","fraud. The Fund is not required to have, nor were we"
"771","engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over"
"772","financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to"
"773","obtain an understanding of internal control over financial"
"774","reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"775","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"776","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"777","opinion."
"778","Our audits included performing procedures to assess the"
"779","risks of material misstatement of the financial statements"
"780","and financial highlights, whether due to error or fraud, and"
"781","performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such"
"782","procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence"
"783","regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial"
"784","statements and financial highlights. Our audits also"
"785","included evaluating the accounting principles used and"
"786","significant estimates made by management, as well as"
"787","evaluating the overall presentation of the financial"
"788","statements and financial highlights. Our procedures"
"789","included confirmation of securities owned as of December"
"790","31, 2017, by correspondence with the custodian and"
"791","brokers; when replies were not received from brokers, we"
"792","performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our"
"793","audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion."
