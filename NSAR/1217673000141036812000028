"1778","BARON SELECT FUNDS                                             DECEMBER 31, 2011"
"1779","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"1780","DISCLOSURE REGARDING THE APPROVAL OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT FOR BARON"
"1781","ENERGY AND RESOURCES FUND BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES (UNAUDITED)"
"1782","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"1783","The Board of Trustees (the Board) of Baron Select Funds (the Trust) met on"
"1784","August 11, 2011 to discuss the selection of BAMCO, Inc. (the Adviser) as the"
"1785","investment adviser and the approval of the investment advisory agreement for the"
"1786","Baron Energy and Resources Fund series of the Trust (the Fund). The members of"
"1787","the Board who are not affiliated with the Adviser (the Independent Trustees)"
"1788","met in separate session to discuss and consider the approval of the proposed"
"1789","advisory contract for the Fund. The Trustees received a substantial amount of"
"1790","information from the Adviser and were advised by independent counsel. Based on"
"1791","its evaluation of this and other information, the Board, including a majority of"
"1792","the Independent Trustees, approved the advisory agreement for the Fund for an"
"1793","initial two year period. In reaching its determination, the Board considered"
"1794","various factors that it deemed relevant, including the factors listed below."
"1795","1. NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES"
"1796","As part of their consideration of the nature, extent and quality of proposed"
"1797","services to be provided by the Adviser, the Independent Trustees relied on the"
"1798","information they received at the Board meeting, as well as other information"
"1799","they received. In particular, the Board considered the following:"
"1800","  o  Their confidence in the senior personnel, portfolio management, the"
"1801","     financial condition of the Adviser and its affiliates and the Adviser's"
"1802","     available resources;"
"1803","  o  The nature, quality and the level of long-term performance of the services"
"1804","     to be provided by the Adviser, including: intensive devotion to research,"
"1805","     selection of broker/dealers for Fund portfolio transactions, relationships"
"1806","     with and supervision of third party service providers, such as the Fund's"
"1807","     custodian and transfer agent, the quality of shareholder reports, the"
"1808","     ability to monitor adherence to investment guidelines and restrictions,"
"1809","     the legal, accounting and compliance services to be provided to the Fund"
"1810","     and the support services to be provided to the Board;"
"1811","  o  The Adviser's investment principles and processes;"
"1812","  o  The total expense ratio of the Fund and its comparison to similar funds"
"1813","     managed by other advisers; and"
"1814","  o  Any additional services to be provided by the Adviser."
"1815","The Board concluded that the nature, extent and quality of the services to be"
"1816","provided by the Adviser to the Fund were appropriate and that the Fund was"
"1817","likely to benefit from those services to be provided under the advisory"
"1818","agreement with the Adviser."
"1819","2. COSTS OF SERVICES PROVIDED AND PROFITS TO BE REALIZED BY THE ADVISER"
"1820","As part of its consideration of the cost of services to be provided, the Board"
"1821","examined the fees to be charged by the Adviser as compared to the fees charged"
"1822","by comparable funds, based on information provided by the Adviser."
"1823","The Board also considered the Adviser's management fees for other public pooled"
"1824","investment vehicles for which the Adviser serves as a sub-adviser and the basis"
"1825","of compensation for separate accounts and private accounts managed by an"
"1826","affiliated adviser. While the fees for the other funds and accounts are the same"
"1827","as, or lower than, the proposed fees for the Fund, the Adviser performs only"
"1828","portfolio management services for those clients and does not provide many of the"
"1829","other services to be provided to the Fund. The Board discussed and considered"
"1830","those other services, which include accounting, oversight of service providers,"
"1831","legal, regulatory, compliance, risk management and Trustee support."
"1832","In addition, the Board also considered the financial condition of the Adviser"
"1833","and its affiliates. Since the Fund is newly formed, had not commenced operations"
"1834","and the eventual aggregate amount of the Fund's assets was uncertain, the"
"1835","Adviser was not able to provide the Board with specific information concerning"
"1836","the cost of services to be provided and the expected profits to be realized by"
"1837","the Adviser and its affiliate from their relationships with the Fund."
"1838","The Board concluded that the proposed management fee, as well as the total"
"1839","expenses to be paid by the Fund to the Adviser and its affiliates, were"
"1840","reasonable in light of the services to be provided."
"1841","3. ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND BENEFITS TO INVESTORS"
"1842","Since the Fund is newly formed, had not commenced operations and the eventual"
"1843","aggregate amount of the Fund's assets was uncertain, the Adviser was not able to"
"1844","provide the Board with specific information concerning the extent to which"
"1845","economies of scale would be realized as the Fund grows and whether fee levels"
"1846","would reflect such economies of scale, if any. It was agreed that the issue"
"1847","would be revisited no later than when the Board next reviewed the advisory fee"
"1848","in connection with the renewal of the advisory contract for the Fund."
"1849","After due consideration of the above enumerated factors, and additional factors,"
"1850","the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, approved the Fund's"
"1851","investment advisory agreement."

"1861","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1862","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"1863","Baron Select Funds"
"1864","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Baron"
"1865","Partners Fund, Baron Focused Growth Fund, Baron International Growth Fund,"
"1866","Baron Real Estate Fund and Baron Emerging Markets Fund (five of the"
"1867","portfolios constituting the Baron Select Funds, hereafter referred to as the"
"1868","Funds) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011, in accordance with"
"1869","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"1870","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1871","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1872","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1873","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1874","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"1875","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion"
"1876","on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"1877","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1878","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1879","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1880","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control"
"1881","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1882","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1883","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1884","accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1885","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1886","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1887","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"1888","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1889","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1890","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1891","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1892","trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1893","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1894","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1895","statements."
"1896","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1897","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1898","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1899","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1900","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1901","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1902","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"1903","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1904","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1905","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1906","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1907","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1908","on a timely basis."
"1909","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"1910","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1911","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1912","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1913","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"1914","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1915","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"1916","be material weaknesses as defined above as of December 31, 2011."
"1917","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"1918","Board of Trustees of Baron Select Funds Trust and the Securities and Exchange"
"1919","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"1920","these specified parties."
