"1086","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1087","To the Board of Trustees of AllianceBernstein Corporate"
"1088","Shares and Shareholders of"
"1089","AllianceBernstein Corporate Income Shares:"
"1090","In planning and performing our audit of"
"1091","the financial statements of AllianceBernstein"
"1092","Corporate Income Shares (one of the portfolios"
"1093","constituting AllianceBernstein Corporate Shares)"
"1094","(the Portfolio), as of and for the year ended"
"1095","April 30, 2011, in accordance with the standards"
"1096","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1097","(United States), we considered the Portfolios"
"1098","internal control over financial reporting,"
"1099","including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1100","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1101","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1102","financial statements and to comply with the"
"1103","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1104","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1105","effectiveness of the Portfolios internal"
"1106","control over financial reporting."
"1107","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1108","The management of the Portfolio is responsible"
"1109","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"1110","internal control over financial reporting."
"1111","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"1112","and judgments by management are required to"
"1113","assess the expected benefits and related"
"1114","costs of controls. A Portfolios internal control"
"1115","over financial reporting is a process designed"
"1116","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1117","reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1118","preparation of financial statements for external"
"1119","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1120","accounting principles. A Portfolios internal"
"1121","control over financial reporting includes"
"1122","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"1123","to the maintenance of records that,"
"1124","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1125","reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"1126","of the assets of the Portfolio; (2) provide"
"1127","reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1128","recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"1129","of financial statements in accordance with"
"1130","generally accepted accounting principles,"
"1131","and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"1132","Portfolio are being made only in accordance"
"1133","with authorizations of management and Trustees"
"1134","of the Portfolio; and (3) provide reasonable"
"1135","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1136","detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1137","use or disposition of a Portfolios assets"
"1138","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1139","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1140","over financial reporting may not prevent"
"1141","or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"1142","any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1143","periods are subject to the risk that controls"
"1144","may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1145","conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1146","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1147","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1148","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"1149","of a control does not allow management or"
"1150","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1151","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1152","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1153","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination"
"1154","of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"1155","financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1156","reasonable possibility that a material"
"1157","misstatement of the Portfolios annual or"
"1158","interim financial statements will not be"
"1159","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1160","Our consideration of the Portfolios internal"
"1161","control over financial reporting was for"
"1162","the limited purpose described in the first"
"1163","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1164","all deficiencies in internal control that"
"1165","might be material weaknesses under standards"

"1171","that we consider to be a material weakness"
"1172","as defined above as of April 30, 2011."
