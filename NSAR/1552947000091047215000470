"451","<DESCRIPTION>WEST SHORE AUDIT LETTER"
"452","<TEXT>"
"453","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"454","Firm"
"455","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"456","West Shore Real Return Income Fund"
"457","In planning and performing our audit of the consolidated"
"458","financial statements of West Shore Real Return Income"
"459","Fund (the Fund) as of April 30, 2015 and for the year"
"460","then ended, in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the"
"461","Public  Fund Accounting Oversight  Board (United"
"462","States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"463","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"464","securities, as a basis for  designing our auditing"
"465","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"466","the  consolidated financial statements and to comply"
"467","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but  not  for  the"
"468","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"469","the Fund's internal  control  over  financial reporting."
"470","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"471","The  management  of  the  Fund  is  responsible for"
"472","establishing and maintaining effective   internal  control"
"473","over  financial  reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"474","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"475","are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"476","costs of controls. A fund's internal control over financial"
"477","reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide reasonable"
"478","assurance regarding  the  reliability  of  financial"
"479","reporting  and  the  preparation  of consolidated financial"
"480","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"481","generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A"
"482","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"483","those  policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"484","maintenance of records that, in  reasonable  detail,"
"485","accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the transactions  and"
"486","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"487","reasonable assurance  that  transactions are recorded as"
"488","necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial"
"489","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts"
"490","and expenditures of  the fund are being made only in"
"491","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"492","directors  of  the  fund;  and  (3)  provide reasonable"
"493","assurance regarding prevention  or  timely detection of"
"494","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of  a  fund's"
"495","assets  that  could  have  a  material  effect  on  the"
"496","consolidated financial statements."
"497","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"498","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"499","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"500","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"501","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"502","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"503","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"504","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"505","exists when the design or  operation of a control does not"
"506","allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"507","of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent"
"508","or  detect misstatements  on  a  timely  basis.  A material"
"509","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,"
"510","in internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"511","there is reasonable possibility that a material"
"512","misstatement of the fund's annual or interim"
"513","consolidated financial statements will not be prevented"
"514","or detected on a timely basis."
"515","Our  consideration  of  the Fund's internal control over"
"516","financial reporting was for the  limited  purpose"
"517","described  in  the  first  paragraph  and  would not"
"518","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"519","that might be material weaknesses   under  standards"
"520","established  by  the  Public Company  Accounting"
"521","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"522","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"523","reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"524","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material"
"525","weakness as defined above as of April 30, 2015."
"526","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"527","of management and the Board of Trustees of the Fund"
"528","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"529","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"530","than these specified parties."
