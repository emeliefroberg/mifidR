"527","Since February"
"528","2004, Federated"
"529"," and related entities"
"530","(collectively,"
"531","Federated) have"

"536","pending in the"
"537","United States District"
"538","Court for the Western"

"540","These lawsuits have been"

"583","Report of"
"584"," Independent"
"585","Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"586","To the Shareholders"
"587","and Board of Directors of"
"588","Federated Government"
"589","Income Securities, Inc:"
"590","In planning and"
"591","performing our audit of"
"592","the financial statements of"
"593"," Federated"
"594","Government Income"
"595","Securities, Inc. (the Fund)"
"596","as of and for the year ended February"
"597","28, 2011, in accordance"
"598","with the standards of the Public"
"599","Company Accounting Oversight"
"600","Board (United States),"
"601","we considered the Fund's"
"602","internal control over financial"
"603","reporting,"
"604","including controls over"
"605","safeguarding securities,"
"606"," as a basis for designing"
"607","our auditing"
"608","procedures for the"
"609","purpose of expressing"
"610"," our opinion on the"
"611","financial statements and to"
"612","comply with the"
"613","requirements of Form"
"614"," N-SAR, but not for the"
"615","purpose of expressing an"
"616","opinion on the effectiveness"
"617"," of the Fund's internal"
"618","control over financial reporting."
"619","Accordingly, we express"
"620","no such opinion."
"621","The management of the"
"622","Fund is responsible for"
"623","establishing and maintaining"
"624","effective"
"625","internal control over"
"626","financial reporting. In"
"627","fulfilling this responsibility,"
"628"," estimates and"
"629","judgments by management"
"630","are required to assess"
"631","the expected benefits and"
"632","related costs"
"633","of controls. A company's"
"634","internal control over"
"635","financial reporting is a"
"636","process designed to"
"637","provide reasonable"
"638","assurance regarding the"
"639","reliability of financial"
"640","reporting and the"
"641","preparation of financial"
"642","statements for external"
"643","purposes in accordance"
"644","with generally"
"645","accepted accounting principles."
"646","A company's internal control"
"647","over financial reporting"
"648","includes those policies and"
"649","procedures that (1) pertain"
"650","to the maintenance of records"
"651","that,"
"652","in reasonable detail,"
"653","accurately and fairly reflect"
"654","the transactions and"
"655","dispositions of the"
"656","assets of the company;"
"657","(2)"
"658"," provide reasonable"
"659","assurance that transactions"
"660","are recorded as"
"661","necessary to permit"
"662","preparation of financial"
"663","statements in accordance"
"664","with generally"
"665","accepted accounting"
"666","principles, and that"
"667","receipts and expenditures"
"668","of the company are"
"669","being made only in accordance"
"670"," with authorizations of"
"671","management and directors"
"672","of the"
"673","company; and (3) provide"
"674","reasonable assurance"
"675","regarding prevention or timely"
"676","detection"
"677","of unauthorized acquisition,"
"678","use or disposition of a"
"679","company's assets that"
"680","could have a"
"681","material effect on the"
"682","financial statements."
"683","Because of its inherent"
"684","limitations, internal"
"685"," control over financial reporting may not"
"686","prevent or detect"
"687","misstatements. Also,"
"688","projections of any evaluation"
"689","of effectiveness to"
"690","future periods are subject"
"691","to the risk that controls"
"692","may become inadequate"
"693","because of"
"694","changes in conditions,"
"695","or"
"696","that the degree of compliance"
"697"," with the policies or procedures"
"698","may deteriorate."
"699","A deficiency in"
"700","internal control over"
"701","financial reporting exists"
"702","when the design or"
"703","operation of a control does"
"704","not allow management or"
"705","employees, in the normal"
"706","course of"
"707","performing their assigned"
"708","functions, to prevent or"
"709","detect misstatements on"
"710","a timely basis."
"711","A material weakness is a"
"712","deficiency, or a combination"
"713","of deficiencies, in internal"
"714","control"
"715","over financial reporting,"
"716","such that there is a reasonable"
"717"," possibility that a material"
"718","misstatement of the company's"
"719","annual or interim financial"
"720","statements will not be"
"721","prevented or detected on a"
"722"," timely basis."
"723","Our consideration of the"
"724","Fund's internal control over"
"725","financial reporting was for"
"726","the"
"727","limited purpose described"
"728","in the first paragraph and"
"729"," would not necessarily disclose"
"730","all"
"731","deficiencies in internal"
"732","control that might be material"
"733","weaknesses under standards"
"734","established by the Public"
"735","Company Accounting"
"736","Oversight Board (United States)."
"737","However, we noted no"
"738","deficiencies in the"
"739","Fund's internal control"
"740"," over financial reporting"
"741","and its operation,"
"742"," including controls"
"743","over safeguarding"
"744"," securities that we"
"745","consider to be a"
"746","material weakness"
"747","as defined above as"
"748","of February 28, 2011."
"749","This report is intended"
"750","solely for the information"
"751","and use of management and the"
"752","Board"
"753","of Directors of the Fund"
"754","and the Securities and Exchange"
"755","Commission and is not"
"756","intended to be, and should not"
"757"," be, used by anyone other than"
"758","these specified parties."
