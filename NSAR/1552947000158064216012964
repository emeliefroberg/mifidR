"502","REPORT OF"
"503","INDEPENDENT"
"504","REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"505","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"506","Board of Trustees and"
"507","Shareholders"
"508","Redwood Managed"
"509","Volatility Fund"
"510","In planning and"
"511","performing our audit"
"512","of the financial"
"513","statements of"
"514","Redwood Managed"
"515","Volatility Fund (a fund"
"516","in the Two Roads"
"517","Shared Trust) (the"
"518","Fund) as of and for"
"519","the year ended"
"520","October 31, 2016, in"
"521","accordance with the"
"522","standards of the Public"
"523","Company Accounting"
"524","Oversight Board"
"525","(United States), we"
"526","considered the Fund's"
"527","internal control over"
"528","financial reporting,"
"529","including controls over"
"530","safeguarding securities,"
"531","as a basis for designing"
"532","audit procedures for"
"533","the purpose of"
"534","expressing an opinion"
"535","on the financial"
"536","statements and to"
"537","comply with the"
"538","requirements of Form"
"539","N-SAR, but not for"
"540","the purpose of"
"541","expressing an opinion"
"542","on the effectiveness of"
"543","the Fund's internal"
"544","control over financial"
"545","reporting. Accordingly,"
"546","we express no such"
"547","opinion."
"548","Management of the"
"549","Fund is responsible for"
"550","establishing and"
"551","maintaining effective"
"552","internal control over"
"553","financial reporting. In"
"554","fulfilling this"
"555","responsibility,"
"556","estimates and"
"557","judgments by"
"558","management are"
"559","required to assess the"
"560","expected benefits and"
"561","related costs of"
"562","controls. A fund's"
"563","internal control over"
"564","financial reporting is a"
"565","process designed to"
"566","provide reasonable"
"567","assurance regarding"
"568","the reliability of"
"569","financial reporting and"
"570","the preparation of"
"571","financial statements"
"572","for external purposes"
"573","in accordance with"
"574","generally accepted"
"575","accounting principles."
"576","A fund's internal"
"577","control over financial"
"578","reporting includes"
"579","those policies and"
"580","procedures that (1)"
"581","pertain to the"
"582","maintenance of"
"583","records that, in"
"584","reasonable detail,"
"585","accurately and fairly"
"586","reflect the transactions"
"587","and dispositions of the"
"588","assets of the fund; (2)"
"589","provide reasonable"
"590","assurance that"
"591","transactions are"
"592","recorded as necessary"
"593","to permit preparation"
"594","of financial statements"
"595","in accordance with"
"596","generally accepted"
"597","accounting principles,"
"598","and that receipts and"
"599","expenditures of the"
"600","fund are being made"
"601","only in accordance"
"602","with authorizations of"
"603","management and"
"604","directors of the fund;"
"605","and (3) provide"
"606","reasonable assurance"
"607","regarding prevention"
"608","or timely detection of"
"609","unauthorized"
"610","acquisition, use, or"
"611","disposition of the"
"612","fund's assets that could"
"613","have a material effect"
"614","on the financial"
"615","statements."
"616","Because of its inherent"
"617","limitations, internal"
"618","control over financial"
"619","reporting may not"
"620","prevent or detect"
"621","misstatements. Also"
"622","projections of any"
"623","evaluation of"
"624","effectiveness to future"
"625","periods are subject to"
"626","the risk that controls"
"627","may become"
"628","inadequate because of"
"629","changes in conditions,"
"630","or the degree of"
"631","compliance with"
"632","policies and"
"633","procedures may"
"634","deteriorate."
"635","A deficiency in internal"
"636","control over financial"
"637","reporting exists when"
"638","the design or operation"
"639","of a control does not"
"640","allow management or"
"641","employees, in the"
"642","normal course of"
"643","performing their"
"644","assigned functions, to"
"645","prevent or detect"
"646","misstatements on a"
"647","timely basis. A material"
"648","weakness is a"
"649","deficiency, or a"
"650","combination of"
"651","deficiencies, in internal"
"652","control over financial"
"653","reporting, such that"
"654","there is a reasonable"
"655","possibility that a"
"656","material misstatement"
"657","of the Fund's annual"
"658","or interim financial"
"659","statements will not be"
"660","prevented or detected"
"661","on a timely basis."
"662","Our consideration of"
"663","the Fund's internal"
"664","control over financial"
"665","reporting was for the"
"666","limited purpose"
"667","described in the first"
"668","paragraph and would"
"669","not necessarily disclose"
"670","all deficiencies in"
"671","internal control over"
"672","financial reporting that"
"673","might be material"
"674","weaknesses under"
"675","standards established"
"676","by the Public"
"677","Company Accounting"
"678","Oversight Board"
"679","(United States)."
"680","However, we noted no"
"681","deficiencies in the"
"682","Fund's internal control"
"683","over financial"
"684","reporting and its"
"685","operation, including"
"686","controls over"
"687","safeguarding securities,"
"688","that we consider to be"
"689","material weaknesses as"
"690","defined above as of"
"691","October 31, 2016."
"692","This report is intended"
"693","solely for the"
"694","information and use of"
"695","management and the"

"697","the Two Roads Shared"
