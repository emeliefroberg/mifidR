"756","<P style=margin:0px; font-size:12pt align=justify>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of The Arbitrage Fund and The Arbitrage Event-Driven Fund (the Funds) which comprise the Arbitrage Funds as of and for the year ended May 31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font> internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font> internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp;Accordingly, we express no such opinion. &nbsp;</P>"
"757","<P style=margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px; font-size:12pt align=justify>The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. </P>"
"758","<P style=margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px; font-size:12pt align=justify>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>"
"759","<P style=margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px; font-size:12pt align=justify>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. </P>"

The Trust&#146;s previous independent registered public accounting firm, Tait, Weller &amp; Baker LLP (&#147;Tait Weller&#148;), was dismissed as of that date.

During the fiscal periods referred to above and the interim period beginning June 1, 2011 through May 8, 2012 (i) there were no disagreements with Tait Weller on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Tait Weller, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports on the Trust&#146;s financial statements for such years; and (ii) there were no reportable events of the kind described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S<FONT style=font-family:Calibri,Times New Roman><font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8208;</font></FONT>K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Arial'>&#8220;</font>Regulation S<FONT style=font-family:Calibri,Times New Roman><font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8208;</font></FONT>K<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Arial'>&#8221;</font>).</P>"
