Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companies' internal control over financial reporting.</FONT></P>"

"1255","<FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>The management of the Companies is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company&#146;s </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company&#146;s assets that could have </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>a material effect on the financial statements.</FONT></P>"
"1256","<P style=text-align: left;>"
"1257","<FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</FONT></P>"
"1258","<P style=text-align: left;>"
"1259","<FONT size=2 face=Georgia,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companies' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</FONT></P>"

<FONT size=2 face=TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif>T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Funds, Inc. (the corporation), is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act). The Personal Strategy Balanced Fund (the fund) is a diversified, open-end management investment company established by the corporation. The fund seeks the highest total return over time consistent with an emphasis on both capital growth and income. The fund pursues this objective by investing in a diversified portfolio typically consisting of approximately 60% stocks, 30% bonds, and 10% money market securities. The fund has two classes of shares: the Personal Strategy Balanced Fund original share class, referred to in this report as the Investor Class, incepted on July 29, 1994, and the Personal Strategy Balanced Fund&#150;I Class (I Class), incepted on March, 23, 2016 . I Class shares generally are available only to investors meeting a &#36;1,000,000 minimum investment or certain other criteria. Each class has exclusive voting rights on matters related solely to that class; separate voting rights on matters that relate to both classes; and, in all other respects, the same rights and obligations as the other class.</FONT></P>

Expenses common to both classes, investment income, and realized and unrealized gains and losses are allocated to the classes based upon the relative daily net assets of each class.</FONT></P>
<P style=text-align: left;>
<FONT size=2 face=TimesNewRomanPSMT,Times New Roman,Times,serif>The I Class is subject to an operating expense limitation (I Class limit) pursuant to which Price Associates is contractually required to pay all operating expenses of the I Class, excluding management fees, interest, borrowing-related expenses, taxes, brokerage commissions, and extraordinary expenses, to the extent such operating expenses, on an annualized basis, exceed 0.05% of average net assets. This agreement will continue until April 30, 2018, and may be renewed, revised or revoked only with approval of the fund&#146;s Board. The I Class is required to repay Price Associates for expenses previously paid to the extent the class&#146;s net assets grow or expenses decline sufficiently to allow repayment without causing the class&#146;s operating expenses to exceed the I Class limit. However, no repayment will be made more than three years after the date of a payment or waiver. Pursuant to this agreement, &#36;2,635,000 of expenses were waived/paid by Price Associates during the year ended May 31, 2016 and remain subject to repayment by the fund.</FONT></P>
