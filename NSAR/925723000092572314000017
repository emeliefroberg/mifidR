"542","Report of Independent Registered Public Accou"
"543","nting Firm"
"544","To the Shareholders and"
"545","Board of Trustees of"
"546","Federated Institutional Trust"
"547","In planning and performing our audits of the fina"
"548","ncial statements of the Federated Short-"
"549","Intermediate Total Return Bond Fund (formerly Fed"
"550","erated Intermediate Government/Corporate"
"551","Fund), (the Fund), a portfolio of Federated Inst"
"552","itutional Trust, as of and for the year ended"
"553","August 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards"
"554","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"555","Board (United States), we considered the Fund's in"
"556","ternal control over financial reporting,"
"557","including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"558"," a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"559","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the f"
"560","inancial statements and to comply with the"
"561","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpos"
"562","e of expressing an opinion on the"
"563","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"564","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"565","such opinion."
"566","Management of the Fund is responsible for establish"
"567","ing and maintaining effective internal"
"568","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling thi"
"569","s responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"570","management are required to assess the expected bene"
"571","fits and related costs of controls. A"
"572","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"573"," is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"574","assurance regarding the reliability of financial rep"
"575","orting and the preparation of financial"
"576","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"577","generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"578","company's internal control over financial reporting"
"579","includes those policies and procedures that"
"580","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in r"
"581","easonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"582","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of t"
"583","he company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"584","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permi"
"585","t preparation of financial statements in"
"586","accordance with generally accepted accounting princip"
"587","les, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"588","the company are being made in accordance with authori"
"589","zations of management and directors of"
"590","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance rega"
"591","rding prevention or timely detection of"
"592","the unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of t"
"593","he company's assets that could have a"
"594","material affect on the financial statements."
"595","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"596"," over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"597","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluat"
"598","ion of effectiveness to future periods are"
"599","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequa"
"600","te because of changes in conditions, or that"
"601","the degree of compliance with the policies or proced"
"602","ures may deteriorate."
"603","A deficiency in internal control over financial report"
"604","ing exists when the design or operation of a"
"605","control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"606","normal course of performing their"
"607","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements"
"608"," on a timely basis. A material weakness is"
"609","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in int"
"610","ernal control over financial reporting, such"
"611","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"612"," misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim"
"613","financial statements will not be prevented or detected o"
"614","n a timely basis."
"615","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over f"
"616","inancial reporting was for the limited"
"617","purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"618"," necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"619","internal control that might be material weaknesses und"
"620","er standards established by the Public"
"621","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). How"
"622","ever, we noted no deficiencies in"
"623","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting an"
"624","d its operation, including controls over"
"625","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a materi"
"626","al weakness as defined above as of August"
"627","31, 2014."
"628","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"629","use of management and the Board of"
"630","Trustees of Federated Institutional Trust and the Secu"
"631","rities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"632","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"633","than those specified parties."
