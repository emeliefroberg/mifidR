"3915","<P style=margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px; font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman>In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Strategic Advisers Income Opportunities Fund of Funds (the <font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8220;</font>Fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8221;</font>) as of and for the year ended February 29, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp;Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s internal control over financial reporting.</P>"
"3916","<P style=margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px; font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman>The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp;In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. &nbsp;A fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. &nbsp;A fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"3917","<P style=margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px; font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. &nbsp;Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>"
"3918","<P style=margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px; font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. &nbsp;A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</P>"

The Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;1934 Act&#148;)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser&#146;s services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund&#146;s investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser&#146;s fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients.</p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FONT-SIZE:11pt; WIDTH:48px; FLOAT:left; MARGIN-TOP:0px><b>4.</b></p> <p style=FONT-SIZE:11pt; MARGIN:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px align=justify><b>Books, Records and Regulatory Filings</b></p> <p style=CLEAR:left; MARGIN:0px align=justify><br></p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FONT-SIZE:11pt; WIDTH:96px; FLOAT:left; MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:48px>(a)</p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:14px; FONT-SIZE:11pt; MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px align=justify>The Sub-Adviser agrees to maintain and to preserve for the applicable periods any such records as are required to be maintained by the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund by the 1940 Act and rules adopted thereunder, and by any other applicable laws, rules and regulations.

The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;1934 Act&#148;)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser&#146;s services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions.

The Sub-Adviser may open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;1934 Act&#148;)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser&#146;s services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund&#146;s investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the Sub-Adviser&#146;s trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser&#146;s fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients.</p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FONT-SIZE:12pt; WIDTH:48px; FLOAT:left; MARGIN-TOP:0px><b>5.</b></p> <p style=FONT-SIZE:12pt; MARGIN:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px align=justify><b>Books, Records and Regulatory Filings</b></p> <p style=CLEAR:left; MARGIN:0px align=justify><br></p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FONT-SIZE:12pt; WIDTH:96px; FLOAT:left; MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:48px>(a)</p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:16px; FONT-SIZE:12pt; MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px align=justify>The Sub-Adviser agrees to maintain and to preserve for the applicable periods any such records as are required to be maintained by the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund by the 1940 Act and rules adopted thereunder, and by any other applicable laws, rules and regulations.

The Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the <font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#147;</font>1934 Act<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#148;</font>)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients.</p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FONT-SIZE:11pt; WIDTH:48px; FLOAT:left; MARGIN-TOP:0px><b>4.</b></p> <p style=FONT-SIZE:11pt; MARGIN:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px align=justify><b>Books, Records and Regulatory Filings</b></p> <p style=CLEAR:left; MARGIN:0px align=justify><br></p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FONT-SIZE:11pt; WIDTH:96px; FLOAT:left; MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:48px>(a)</p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:14px; FONT-SIZE:11pt; MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px align=justify>The Sub-Adviser agrees to maintain and to preserve for the applicable periods any such records as are required to be maintained by the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund by the 1940 Act and rules adopted thereunder, and by any other applicable laws, rules and regulations.

The Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the <font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8220;</font>1934 Act<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8221;</font>)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser<font style='font-family:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman'>&#8217;</font>s fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients.</P>"

The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate.

In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;1934 Act&#148;)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser&#146;s services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions.

The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate.

In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;1934 Act&#148;)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser&#146;s services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions.

The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;1934 Act&#148;)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser&#146;s services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions.

The Sub-Adviser may open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;1934 Act&#148;)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser&#146;s services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund&#146;s investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the Sub-Adviser&#146;s trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser&#146;s fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients.</p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FONT-SIZE:12pt; WIDTH:48px; FLOAT:left; MARGIN-TOP:0px><b>5.</b></p> <p style=FONT-SIZE:12pt; MARGIN:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px align=justify><b>Books, Records and Regulatory Filings</b></p> <p style=CLEAR:left; MARGIN:0px align=justify><br></p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FONT-SIZE:12pt; WIDTH:96px; FLOAT:left; MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:48px>(a)</p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:16px; FONT-SIZE:12pt; MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px align=justify>The Sub-Adviser agrees to maintain and to preserve for the applicable periods any such records as are required to be maintained by the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund by the 1940 Act and rules adopted thereunder, and by any other applicable laws, rules and regulations.

The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;1934 Act&#148;)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser&#146;s services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions.

The Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;1934 Act&#148;)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser&#146;s services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund&#146;s investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser&#146;s fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients.</p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FONT-SIZE:11pt; WIDTH:48px; FLOAT:left; MARGIN-TOP:0px><b>4.</b></p> <p style=FONT-SIZE:11pt; MARGIN:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px align=justify><b>Books, Records and Regulatory Filings</b></p> <p style=CLEAR:left; MARGIN:0px align=justify><br></p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FONT-SIZE:11pt; WIDTH:96px; FLOAT:left; MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:48px>(a)</p> <p style=MARGIN-BOTTOM:14px; FONT-SIZE:11pt; MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px align=justify>The Sub-Adviser agrees to maintain and to preserve for the applicable periods any such records as are required to be maintained by the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund by the 1940 Act and rules adopted thereunder, and by any other applicable laws, rules and regulations.
