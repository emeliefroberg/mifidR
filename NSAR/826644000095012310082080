"1402","             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1403","To the Board of Trustees of AIM Investment Funds (Invesco Investment Funds)"
"1404","and Shareholders of Invesco Van Kampen Emerging Markets Fund:"
"1405","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco Van"
"1406","Kampen Emerging Markets Fund (formerly known as Van Kampen Emerging Markets"
"1407","Fund; one of the funds constituting AIM Investment Funds (Invesco Investment"
"1408","Funds), hereafter referred to as the Fund) as of and for the year ended June"
"1409","30, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1410","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"1411","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"1412","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"1413","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1414","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1415","Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express"
"1416","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1417","reporting."
"1418","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1419","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1420","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1421","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"1422","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1423","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1424","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1425","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"1426","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1427","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1428","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1429","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1430","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1431","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"1432","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of"
"1433","the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1434","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"1435","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1436","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1437","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1438","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1439","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1440","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1441","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"1442","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"1443","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1444","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1445","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1446","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1447","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1448","on a timely basis."
"1449","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"

"1707","IFG. As part of the settlements, a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of which"

"1730","Pending Regulatory Action Alleging Market Timing"
"1731","          On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor -"

"1733","Notice of Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (Order No."
"1734","05-1318). The WVASC makes findings of fact that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"1735","entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the Invesco Funds"
"1736","and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for such Funds,"
"1737","and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"1738","violated the West Virginia securities laws. The WVASC orders Invesco and Invesco"
"1739","Distributors to cease any further violations and seeks to impose monetary"
"1740","sanctions, including restitution to affected investors, disgorgement of fees,"
"1741","reimbursement of investigatory, administrative and legal costs and an"
"1742","administrative assessment, to be determined by the Commissioner. Initial"
"1743","research indicates that these damages could be limited or capped by statute. By"
"1744","agreement with the Commissioner of Securities, Invesco's time to respond to that"
"1745","Order has been indefinitely suspended."

"1789","          On March 1, 2006, the MDL Court dismissed all derivative causes of"

"2184","     1.1. It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Reorganization"
"2185","described herein shall be conducted separately of the others, and a party that"
"2186","is not a party to a Reorganization shall incur no obligations, duties or"
"2187","liabilities with respect to such Reorganization by reason of being a party to"
"2188","this Agreement. If any one or more Reorganizations should fail to be"
"2189","consummated, such failure shall not affect the other Reorganizations in any way."
"2190","<PAGE>"
"2191","     1.2. Provided that all conditions precedent to a Reorganization set forth"
"2192","herein have been satisfied as of the Closing Date (defined in Section 3.1), and"
"2193","based on the representations and warranties each party provides to the others,"
"2194","each Target Entity and its corresponding Acquiring Entity agree to take the"
"2195","following steps with respect to their Reorganization(s), the parties to which"
"2196","and classes of shares to be issued in connection with which are set forth in"
"2197","Exhibit A:"
"2198","          (a) The Target Fund shall transfer all of its Assets, as defined and"
"2199","     set forth in Section 1.2(b), to the Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund"
"2200","     in exchange therefor shall assume the Liabilities, as defined and set forth"
"2201","     in Section 1.2(c), and deliver to the Target Fund the number of full and"
"2202","     fractional Acquiring Fund shares determined in the manner set forth in"
"2203","     Section 2."
"2204","          (b) The assets of the Target Fund to be transferred to the Acquiring"
"2205","     Fund shall consist of all assets and property, including, without"
"2206","     limitation, all cash, securities, commodities and futures interests, claims"
"2207","     (whether absolute or contingent, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued and"
"2208","     including, without limitation, any interest in pending or future legal"
"2209","     claims in connection with past or present portfolio holdings, whether in"
"2210","     the form of class action claims, opt-out or other direct litigation claims,"
"2211","     or regulator or government-established investor recovery fund claims, and"
"2212","     any and all resulting recoveries) and dividends or interest receivable that"
"2213","     are owned by the Target Fund and any deferred or prepaid expenses shown as"
"2214","     an asset on the books of the Target Fund on the Closing Date, except for"
"2215","     cash, bank deposits or cash equivalent securities in an amount necessary to"
"2216","     pay the estimated costs of extinguishing any Excluded Liabilities (as"
"2217","     defined in Section 1.2(c)) and cash in an amount necessary to pay any"
"2218","     distributions pursuant to Section 7.1(g) (collectively, Assets)."
"2219","          (c) The Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the liabilities of the"
"2220","     Target Fund, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at"
"2221","     the Closing Date, except for the Target Fund's Excluded Liabilities (as"
"2222","     defined below), if any, pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, with"
"2223","     respect to each Target Fund separately, Liabilities). Each Target Fund"
"2224","     will use its best efforts to discharge all known Liabilities prior to or at"
"2225","     the Valuation Date (as defined in Section 2.1(a)) to the extent possible"
"2226","     and consistent with its own investment objectives and policies and normal"
"2227","     business operations. If prior to the Closing Date the Acquiring Entity"
"2228","     identifies a liability that the Acquiring Entity and the Target Entity"
"2229","     mutually agree should not be assumed by the Acquiring Fund, such liability"
"2230","     shall be excluded from the definition of Liabilities hereunder and shall be"
"2231","     listed on a Schedule of Excluded Liabilities to be signed by the Acquiring"
"2232","     Entity and the Target Entity at Closing and attached to this Agreement as"
"2233","     Schedule 1.2(c) (the Excluded Liabilities). The Assets minus the"
"2234","     Liabilities of a Target Fund shall be referred to herein as the Target"
"2235","     Fund's Net Assets."
"2236","          (d) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Target"
"2237","     Fund will distribute to its shareholders of record (Target Fund
     Shareholders) the shares of the Acquiring Fund of the corresponding class"
"2238","     received by the Target Fund pursuant to Section 1.2(a), as set forth in"
"2239","     Exhibit A, on a pro rata basis within that class, and without further"
"2240","     notice the outstanding shares of the Target Fund will be redeemed and"
"2241","     cancelled as permitted by its charter and applicable law, and the Target"
"2242","     Fund will as promptly as practicable completely liquidate and dissolve."
"2243","     Such distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with respect to"
"2244","     each class of the Target Fund's shares, by the transfer of the Acquiring"
"2245","     Fund shares of the corresponding class then credited to"
"2246","                                      -2-"

"2249","     accounts on the share records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the"
"2250","     Target Fund Shareholders of the class. The aggregate net asset value of the"
"2251","     Acquiring Fund shares to be so credited to the corresponding Target Fund"
"2252","     Shareholders shall be equal to the aggregate net asset value of the"
"2253","     corresponding Target Fund's shares owned by the Target Fund Shareholders on"
"2254","     the Valuation Date. The Acquiring Fund shall not issue certificates"
"2255","     representing shares in connection with such exchange."
"2256","          (e) Ownership of Acquiring Fund shares will be shown on its books, as"
"2257","     such are maintained by the Acquiring Fund's transfer agent."
"2258","2.   VALUATION"
"2259","     2.1. With respect to each Reorganization:"
"2260","          (a) The value of the Target Fund's Assets shall be the value of such"
"2261","     Assets computed as of immediately after the close of regular trading on the"
"2262","     New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which shall reflect the declaration of"
"2263","     any dividends, on the business day next preceding the Closing Date (the"
"2264","     Valuation Date), using the Target Fund's valuation procedures established"
"2265","     by the Target Entity's Board of Trustees, which shall be provided to the"
"2266","     Acquiring Fund prior to the Valuation Date."
"2267","          (b) The net asset value per share of each class of the Acquiring Fund"
"2268","     shares issued in connection with the Reorganization shall be the net asset"
"2269","     value per share of the corresponding class of the Target Fund as of the"
"2270","     close of business on the Valuation Date, provided that, if more than one"
"2271","     class of shares of the Target Fund is being exchanged for a single class of"
"2272","     shares of the Acquiring Fund, then the net asset value per share of such"
"2273","     class of shares of the Acquiring Fund issued in connection with the"
"2274","     Reorganization shall be the net asset value per share of the corresponding"
"2275","     class of the Target Fund having attributes most consistent with the"
"2276","     Acquiring Fund share class, as determined by the Acquiring Fund (the"
"2277","     Primary Share Class), or the net asset value of such other class of"
"2278","     shares of the Target Fund as the parties may mutually agree."
"2279","          (c) The number of shares issued of each class of the Acquiring Fund"
"2280","     (including fractional shares, if any, rounded to the nearest thousandth) in"
"2281","     exchange for the Target Fund's Net Assets shall equal the number of shares"
"2282","     of the corresponding class of the Target Fund outstanding as of the"
"2283","     Valuation Time, provided that if two or more classes of shares of the"
"2284","     Target Fund are exchanged for a single class of shares of the Acquiring"
"2285","     Fund, then the number of Acquiring Fund shares issued with respect to each"
"2286","     such Target Fund class, other than the Primary Share Class, shall equal the"
"2287","     quotient of the net asset value of such class divided by the net asset"
"2288","     value per share of the Primary Share Class, all as of the Valuation Time."
"2289","          (d) All computations of value shall be made by the Target Fund's"
"2290","     designated recordkeeping agent using the valuation procedures described in"
"2291","     this Section 2 and shall be subject to review by the Acquiring Fund's"
"2292","     recordkeeping agent and, if requested by either the Target Entity or the"
"2293","     Acquiring Entity, by the independent registered public accountant of the"
"2294","     requesting party."

"2298","     3.1. Each Reorganization shall close on June 1, 2010 or such other date as"
"2299","the parties may agree with respect to any or all Reorganizations (the Closing

"2480","     United States of America (GAAP) consistently applied, and such statements"
"2481","     (copies of which have been furnished or made available to the Acquiring"
"2482","     Fund) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition of"
"2483","     the Target Fund as of such date in accordance with GAAP, and there are no"
"2484","     known contingent liabilities of the Target Fund required to be reflected on"

"2490","     changes occurring in the ordinary course of business, except as otherwise"

"2501","     as due or claimed to be due by any government entity shall have been paid"

"2518","     governmental authority (domestic or foreign) responsible for the imposition"
"2519","     of any such tax. Return means reports, returns, information returns,"

"2521","     kind (including any attached schedules, supplements and additional or"
"2522","     supporting material) filed or required to be filed with respect to Taxes,"

"2528","     for treatment as a regulated investment company for each taxable year since"
"2529","     inception that has ended prior to the Closing Date and will have satisfied"
"2530","     the requirements of Part I of Subchapter M of the Code to maintain such"
"2531","     qualification for the period beginning on the first day of its current"
"2532","     taxable year and ending on the Closing Date. If Target Fund serves as a"
"2533","     funding vehicle for variable contracts (life insurance or annuity), Target"
"2534","     Fund, with respect to each of its taxable years that has ended prior to the"
"2535","     Closing Date during which it has served as such a funding vehicle, has"
"2536","     satisfied the diversification requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code"
"2537","     and will continue to satisfy the requirements of Section 817(h) of the Code"
"2538","     for the period beginning on the first day of its current taxable year and"
"2539","     ending on the Closing Date. In order to (i) ensure continued qualification"

"2541","     tax purposes and (ii) eliminate any tax liability of the Target Fund"
"2542","     arising by reason of undistributed investment company taxable income or net"
"2543","     capital gain, the Target Fund, unless the Target Fund has been advised by"
"2544","     the Acquiring Fund that the Acquiring Fund will deliver an opinion of"

"2547","     declare on or prior to the Valuation Date to the shareholders of Target"
"2548","     Fund a dividend or dividends that, together with all previous such"
"2549","     dividends, shall have the effect of distributing (A) all of Target Fund's"

"2551","     deductions for dividends paid) for the taxable year ended prior to the"
"2552","     Closing Date and substantially all of such investment company taxable"
