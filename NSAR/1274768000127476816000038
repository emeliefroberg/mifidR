"2517","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting"
"2518","Firm"
"2519","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of"
"2520","SunAmerica Specialty Series In planning and"
"2521","performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"2522","SunAmerica Specialty Series (the Trust) as of and"
"2523","for the year ended October 31, 2016, in accordance"
"2524","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"2525","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"2526","Trusts internal control over financial reporting,"
"2527","including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"2528","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"2529","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"2530","financial statements and to comply with the"
"2531","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"2532","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"2533","the Trusts internal control over financial reporting."
"2534","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"2535","effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over"
"2536","financial reporting."
"2537","The management of the Trust is responsible for"
"2538","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"2539","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"2540","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"2541","management are required to assess the expected"
"2542","benefits and related costs of controls."
"2543","A funds internal control over financial reporting"
"2544","is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"2545","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"2546","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2547","statements for external purposes in accordance"
"2548","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"2549","funds internal control over financial reporting"
"2550","includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"2551","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"2552","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"2553","the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"2554","of each fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"2555","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"2556","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2557","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2558","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"2559","each fund are being made only in accordance with"
"2560","authorizations of management and Trustees of each"
"2561","fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance"
"2562","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2563","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of"
"2564","each funds assets that could have a material"
"2565","effect on the financial statements."
"2566","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"2567","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"2568","or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"2569","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"2570","are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2571","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"2572","or that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"2573","or procedures may deteriorate."
"2574","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"2575","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"2576","a control does not allow management or"
"2577","employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"2578","assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2579","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"2580","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"2581","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"2582","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"2583","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2584","Trusts annual or interim financial statements will"
"2585","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2586","Our consideration of the Trusts internal control"
"2587","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"2588","purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"2589","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"2590","in internal control over financial reporting that"
"2591","might be material weaknesses under standards"
"2592","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"2593","Oversight Board (United States)."
"2594","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trusts"
"2595","internal control over financial reporting and"
"2596","its operation, including controls over"
"2597","safeguarding securities that we consider to be"
"2598","material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"2599","October 31, 2016."
"2600","This report is intended solely for the"
"2601","information and use of management and the Board"
"2602","of Trustees of SunAmerica Specialty Series and"

"2801","      2.         Fund Transactions.   (a) The"
"2802","Subadviser is responsible for: (i) decisions, and"
"2803","is"
"2804","hereby authorized, to buy or sell securities and"
"2805","other investments for the Fund or a portion of the"
"2806","Funds assets allotted to it, (ii) selection of"
"2807","broker-dealers and futures commission merchants and"
"2808","(iii) negotiation of brokerage commission and"
"2809","futures commission merchants rates.  As a general"
"2810","matter, in executing Fund transactions, the"
"2811","Subadviser may employ or deal with such broker-"
"2812","dealers or futures commission merchants as may, in"
"2813","the Subadvisers best judgment, provide"
"2814","prompt and reliable execution of the transactions"
"2815","at favorable prices and reasonable commission"
"2816","rates.  In selecting such broker-dealers or futures"
"2817","commission merchants, the Subadviser shall"
"2818","consider  all  relevant  factors  including  price"
"2819","(including  the  applicable  brokerage  commission,"
"2820","dealer spread or futures commission merchant rate),"
"2821","the size of the order, the nature of the market"
"2822","for the security or other investment, the timing of"
"2823","the transaction, the reputation, experience and"
"2824","financial stability of the broker-dealer or futures"
"2825","commission merchant involved, the quality of the"
"2826","service, the difficulty of execution, the execution"
"2827","capabilities and operational facilities of the firm"
"2828","involved, and, in the case of securities,  the"
"2829","firm's risk in positioning a block of securities."
"2830","Subject"
"2831","to such policies as the Trustees may determine and"
"2832","consistent with Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"2833","Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act),"
"2834","the Subadviser shall not be deemed to have"
"2835","acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty"
"2836","created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by"
"2837","reason of the Subadviser's having caused a Fund to"
"2838","pay a member of an exchange, broker or dealer"
"2839","an amount of commission for effecting a securities"
"2840","transaction in excess of the amount of"
"2841","commission another member of an exchange, broker or"
"2842","dealer would have charged for effecting"
"2843","that transaction, if the Subadviser determines in"
"2844","good faith that such amount of commission was"
"2845","reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"2846","brokerage and research services provided by such"
"2847","member"
"2848","of an exchange, broker or dealer viewed in terms of"
"2849","either that particular transaction or the"
"2850","Subadviser's overall responsibilities with respect"
"2851","to such Fund and to other clients as to which the"
"2852","Subadviser exercises investment discretion.  In"
"2853","accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and"
"2854","Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder, and subject to any other"
"2855","applicable laws and regulations including"
"2856","Section 17(e) of the Act and Rule 17e-1 thereunder,"
"2857","the Subadviser may engage its affiliates, the"
"2858","Adviser and its affiliates or any other subadviser"
"2859","to the Trust and its respective affiliates, as"
"2860","broker-"
"2861","dealers or futures commission merchants to effect"
"2862","Fund transactions in securities and other"
"2863","investments for a Fund.   The Subadviser will"
"2864","promptly communicate to the Adviser and to the"
"2865","officers and the Trustees of the Trust such"
"2866","information relating to Fund transactions as they"
"2867","may"
"2868","reasonably request, including but not limited to,"
"2869","reports prepared by independent third parties"
"2870","relating to the execution costs of such"
"2871","transactions.  To the extent consistent with"
"2872","applicable law,"
"2873","the Subadviser may aggregate purchase or sell"
"2874","orders for the Fund with contemporaneous purchase"
"2875","or sell orders of other clients of the Subadviser"
"2876","or its affiliated persons.  In such event,"
"2877","allocation"
"2878","of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as"
"2879","the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be"
"2880","made by the Subadviser in the manner the Subadviser"
"2881","determines to be equitable and consistent"
"2882","with its and its affiliates fiduciary obligations"
"2883","to the Fund and to such other clients.  The Adviser"
"2884","hereby acknowledges that such aggregation of orders"
"2885","may not result in more favorable pricing or"
"2886","lower brokerage commissions in all instances."
"2887","      (b)       Notwithstanding Section 2(a) above,"
"2888","for such purposes as obtaining investment"
"2889","research  products  and  services,  covering  fees"
"2890","and  expenses,  the  Adviser  may  request  the"
"2891","Subadviser to effect a specific percentage of the"
"2892","transactions in securities and other investments it"
"2893","effects on behalf of a Fund with certain broker-"
"2894","dealers and futures commission merchants.  In"
"2895","designating the use of a particular broker-dealer"
"2896","or futures commission merchant, the Adviser and"
"2897","Subadviser acknowledge and agree that all brokerage"
"2898","transactions are subject to best execution."
"2899","As such, Subadviser will use its best efforts to"
"2900","direct non-risk commission transactions to a"
"2901","particular broker-dealer or futures commission"
"2902","merchant designated by the Adviser consistent with"
"2903","its obligations regarding best execution.  Adviser"
"2904","acknowledges that Subadviser may be unable to"
"2905","fulfill the Advisers request for direction for a"
"2906","number of reasons, including, but not limited to:"
"2907","1)"
"2908","such direction may result in the Subadviser paying"
"2909","a higher commission, depending upon the"
"2910","Subadvisers arrangements with the particular"
"2911","broker-dealer or futures commission merchant, etc.;"
"2912","2) if the Subadviser directs payments of an"
"2913","excessive amount of commissions, the executions may"
"2914","not be accomplished as rapidly; 3) the Subadviser"
"2915","may forfeit the possible advantage derived from"
"2916","the aggregation of multiple orders as a single"
"2917","bunched transaction where Subadviser would, in"
"2918","some instances, be in a better position to"
"2919","negotiate commissions; or 4) Subadviser does not"
"2920","make"
"2921","commitments to allocate fixed or definite amounts"
"2922","of commissions to brokers."
"2923","      3.         Compensation of the Subadviser."
"2924","The Subadviser shall not be entitled to receive"
"2925","any payment from the Trust and shall look solely"
"2926","and exclusively to the Adviser for payment of all"
"2927","fees for the services rendered, facilities"
"2928","furnished and expenses paid by it hereunder.  As"
"2929","full"
"2930","compensation  for  the  Subadviser  under  this"
"2931","Agreement,  the  Adviser  agrees  to  pay  to  the"
"2932","Subadviser a fee at the annual rate set forth in"
"2933","Schedule A hereto with respect to each Fund, or"
"2934","portion thereof, that the Subadviser manages.  Such"
"2935","fee shall be accrued daily and paid monthly as"
"2936","soon as practicable after the end of each month"
"2937","(i.e., the applicable annual fee rate divided by"
"2938","365"
"2939","applied to each prior days net assets in order to"
"2940","calculate the daily accrual).  If the Subadviser"
"2941","shall"
"2942","provide its services under this Agreement for less"
"2943","than the whole of any month, the foregoing"
"2944","compensation shall be prorated."
"2945","      4.         Other Services.  At the request of"
"2946","the Trust or the Adviser, the Subadviser, in its"
"2947","discretion, may make available to the Trust office"
"2948","facilities, equipment, personnel and other"
"2949","services.    Such  office  facilities,  equipment,"
"2950","personnel  and  services  shall  be  provided  for"
"2951","or"
"2952","rendered by the Subadviser and billed to the Trust"
"2953","or the Adviser at the Subadvisers cost."
"2954","      5.         Reports.  The Trust, the Adviser"
"2955","and the Subadviser agree to furnish to each other,"
"2956","if applicable, current prospectuses, statements of"
"2957","additional information, proxy statements, reports"
"2958","of shareholders, certified copies of their"
"2959","financial statements, and such other information"
"2960","with"
"2961","regard to their affairs and that of the Trust as"
"2962","each may reasonably request."
"2963","      6.         Status of the Subadviser.  The"
"2964","Subadviser shall be deemed to be an independent"
"2965","contractor and shall, unless otherwise expressly"
"2966","provided or authorized, have no authority to act"
"2967","for or represent the Trust in any way or otherwise"
"2968","be deemed an agent of the Trust."
"2969","      7.         Advertising.   Subadviser shall"
"2970","not provide or in any way distribute any sales or"
"2971","advertising materials, whether or not related to"
"2972","the Trust, to any employee or representative of AIG"
"2973","Capital Services, Inc. or its affiliates, including"
"2974","wholesaling personnel, unless such material has"
"2975","been  received  and  approved,  in  writing,  by"
"2976","the  Adviser.     Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,"
"2977","Subadviser may include the Advisers and Trusts"
"2978","names in its client list used in promotional"
"2979","materials with prior consent of the Adviser and/or"
"2980","Trust."
"2981","      8.         Proxy Voting.  Each Fund has"
"2982","appointed Institutional Shareholder Services as the"
"2983","proxy-voting agent and will vote all such proxies"
"2984","in accordance with the proxy voting policies and"
"2985","procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. With"
"2986","respect to certain vote items, a Fund may"
"2987","request guidance or a recommendation from the"
"2988","adviser, administrator or subadviser of the Fund."
"2989","The Subadviser shall not have responsibilities in"
"2990","connection with proxy voting for a Fund unless it"
"2991","is affirmatively requested to make a proxy voting"
"2992","recommendation."
"2993","      9.         Certain Records.  The Subadviser"
"2994","hereby undertakes and agrees to maintain, in the"
"2995","form  and  for  the  period  required  by  Rule"
"2996","31a-2  under  the  Act,  all  records  relating  to"
"2997","the"
"2998","investments of the Funds that are required to be"
"2999","maintained by the Trust pursuant to the"
"3000","requirements of Rule 31a-1 of that Act.  Copies of"
"3001","any records required to be maintained and"
"3002","preserved pursuant to the provisions of Rule 31a-1"
"3003","and Rule 31a-2 promulgated under the Act"
"3004","which are prepared or maintained by the Subadviser"
"3005","on behalf of the Trust will be provided"
"3006","promptly to the Trust or the Adviser on request."
"3007","            The Subadviser agrees that all"
"3008","accounts, books and other records maintained and"
"3009","preserved by it as required hereby shall be subject"
"3010","at any time, and from time to time, to such"
"3011","reasonable periodic, special and other examinations"
"3012","by the Securities and Exchange Commission,"
"3013","the Trust's auditors, the Trust or any"
"3014","representative of the Trust, the Adviser, or any"
"3015","governmental"
"3016","agency or other instrumentality having regulatory"
"3017","authority over the Trust."
"3018","      10.       Reference to the Subadviser."
"3019","Neither the Trust nor the Adviser or any affiliate"
"3020","or"
"3021","agent thereof shall make reference to or use the"
"3022","name or logo of the Subadviser or any of its"
"3023","affiliates in any advertising or promotional"
"3024","materials without the prior approval of the"
"3025","Subadviser,"
"3026","which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld."
"3027","      11.       Liability of the Subadviser.  (a)"
"3028","In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith,"
"3029","gross negligence or reckless disregard of"
"3030","obligations or duties (disabling conduct) hereunder"
"3031","on"
"3032","the part of the Subadviser (and its officers,"
"3033","partners, agents, employees, controlling persons,"
"3034","shareholders and any other person or entity"
"3035","affiliated with the Subadviser), the Subadviser"
"3036","shall not"
"3037","be subject to liability to the Adviser, its"
"3038","officers, Trustees, agents, employees, controlling"

"3044","hereunder, including without limitation, any error"
"3045","of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss"
"3046","suffered by any of them in connection with the"
"3047","matters to which this Agreement relates, except to"
"3048","the extent specified in Section 36(b) of the Act"
"3049","concerning loss resulting from a breach of"
"3050","fiduciary duty with respect to the Subadvisers"
"3051","receipt"
"3052","of compensation for services.  Except for such"
"3053","disabling conduct, the Adviser shall indemnify the"
"3054","Subadviser (and its officers, partners, agents,"

"3056","any"

"3062","expenses) arising from the Subadvisers providing"
"3063","services under this Agreement or the sale of"
"3064","securities of the Trust."
"3065","            (b)       The Subadviser agrees to"
"3066","indemnify and hold harmless the Adviser and its"
"3067","affiliates and each of its Trustees and officers"
"3068","and each person, if any, who controls the Adviser"

"3079","conduct; provided, however, that in no case is the"
"3080","Subadviser's indemnity in favor of any person"
"3081","deemed to protect such other persons against any"
"3082","liability to which such person would otherwise"
"3083","be subject by reasons of willful misfeasance, bad"

"3097","the Subadviser which result from or are based"
"3098","upon acts of the Adviser, including, but not"

"3105","relate to the portion of the assets managed by the"
"3106","Subadviser, otherwise available to the Subadviser"
"3107","upon reasonable request.  The Adviser and"
"3108","Subadviser each agree that, to the extent the"
"3109","Subadviser"
"3110","is responsible for managing only a portion of a"
"3111","Fund, the Subadviser shall manage the portion of"
"3112","the assets of a Fund allocated to it as if it was a"
"3113","separate operating Fund and shall comply with"
"3114","subsections (a) and (b) of Section 1 of this"

"3120","Fund as a regulated investment company under the"
"3121","Code) only with respect to the portion of assets"
"3122","of a Fund allocated to Subadviser.  The Adviser"
"3123","shall indemnify the Indemnified Parties from any"
"3124","and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or"
"3125","litigation (including reasonable legal and other"
"3126","expenses) arising from the conduct of the Adviser,"
"3127","the Trust and any other subadviser with respect"
