"1456","                                        Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1457","To the Trustees of the American  Century  Government  Income Trust and  Shareholders of the Capital"
"1458","Preservation  Fund, the Ginnie"
"1459","Mae Fund, the Government Bond Fund, the Inflation-Adjusted Bond Fund and the Short-Term Government Fund:"
"1460","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of the Capital Preservation Fund,"
"1461","the Ginnie Mae Fund, the Government Bond Fund, the Government Agency Money Market Fund, the"
"1462","Inflation-Adjusted Bond Fund and the Short-Term Government Fund (the Funds)  (the Funds) as of"
"1463","and for the year ended March 31, 2008, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1464","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1465","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1466","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1467","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"1468","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1469","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"1470","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1471","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"1472","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds' internal control over"
"1473","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1474","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1475","generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1476","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1477","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1478","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1479","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"1480","of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund;"
"1481","and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1482","use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1483","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1484","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1485","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"1486","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1487","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control"
"1488","does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"1489","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1490","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"1491","a material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"1492","or detected on a timely basis."
"1493","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1494","described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"1495","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1496","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control"
"1497","over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"1498","to be material weaknesses as defined above as of March 31, 2008."
"1499","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Directors of"
"1500","the Capital Preservation Fund, the Ginnie Mae Fund, the Government Bond Fund, the Inflation-Adjusted Bond"
"1501","Fund and the Short-Term Government Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to"
"1502","be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1522","(a)      Government Bond and Short-Term Government each modified the fee structure of the Advisor Class,"
"1523","         effective 12/03/07."
"1524","         The funds approved a decrease of 25 basis points (0.25%) in the Rule 12b-1 fee charged by the Advisor"
"1525","         Class while simultaneously approving an increase of 25 basis points in the unified management fee for"
"1526","         the Class, resulting in no change to the total expense ratios. The decrease in the Rule 12b-1 fee and"
"1527","         corresponding increase in the unified management fee are designed to move the fee for the provision"
"1528","         of certain recordkeeping/administrative services from the Rule 12b-1 fee to the unified management"
"1529","         fee.  The recordkeeping/administrative services, which include the provision of recordkeeping and"
"1530","         related services that would otherwise be performed by the Funds' transfer agent, may be performed by"
"1531","         financial intermediaries or by the advisor or its affiliates.  In circumstances in which the"
"1532","         recordkeeping/administrative services are performed by financial intermediaries, the advisor will pay"
"1533","         such intermediaries all or part of the recordkeeping/administrative fee for performing the services."
"1534","         The recordkeeping/administrative services, which will not change, do not encompass"
"1535","         distribution-related services.  This modification will make the fee structure of the Advisor Class"
"1536","         shares more consistent with the other share classes of the American Century Funds. Any reimbursement"
"1537","         paid to financial intermediaries for the provision of recordkeeping/administrative services will now"
"1538","         be paid out of the unified management fee received by the Advisor and not the Rule 12b-1 fee."
"1539","         The 25 basis point increase in the unified management fee is not expected to have any effect on the"
"1540","         total expense ratio of the Advisor Class shares.  As previously noted, the 25 basis point increase in"
"1541","         the unified management fee will be offset by a corresponding decrease of 25 basis points in the Rule"
"1542","         12b-1 fee."
"1543","         2) Effective 12/03/07, the Ginnie Mae C Class shareholder received Ginnie Mae Advisor Class shares in"
"1544","         exchange for their C Class shares.  Accordingly, C Class shares of Ginnie Mae will no longer be"
"1545","         offered."
"1546","         The C Class shares of Ginnie Mae were reclassified as Advisor Class.  As a result of this"
"1547","         reclassification, each holder of C Class shares became the owner of Advisor Class shares of the same"
"1548","         fund, having a total net asset value (NAV) equal to the total NAV of his or her C Class holdings in"
"1549","         the fund on the date of the reclassification."
"1550","         The net asset value of a shareholder's investment in the fund will not change as a result of the"
"1551","         reclassification.   It is anticipated that there will not be any tax consequences as a result of the"
"1552","         reclassification."

"1702","Section 1.  Place of Meetings"
"1703","Meetings of shareholders shall be held at any place within or outside The Commonwealth of Massachusetts"
"1704","designated by the Board of Trustees.  In the absence of any such designation, shareholders' meetings shall be"
"1705","held at the principal executive office of the Trust."
"1706","Section 2.  Call of Meeting"
"1707","A meeting of the shareholders shall be held whenever called by the Trustees and whenever required by the"
"1708","provisions of the 1940 Act.  A shareholder meeting may be called at any time by the Board of Trustees or by the"
"1709","Chairman of the Board or by the President.  If a shareholder meeting is a meeting of the shareholders of one or"
"1710","more series or classes of shares, but not a meeting of all shareholders of the Trust, then only special meetings"
"1711","of the shareholders of such one or more series or classes shall be called and only the shareholders of such one"
"1712","or more series or classes shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting."
"1713","Section 3.  Notice of Shareholders' Meeting"
"1714","All notices of meetings of shareholders shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 4 of this"
"1715","Article II not less than ten (10) nor more than seventy-five (75) days before the date of the meeting.  The"
"1716","notice shall specify (i) the place, date and hour of the meeting, and (ii) the general nature of the business to"
"1717","be transacted.  The notice of any meeting at which trustees are to be elected also shall include the name of any"
"1718","nominee or nominees whom at the time of the notice are intended to be presented for election."
"1719","If action is proposed to be taken at any meeting for approval of (i) a contract or transaction in which a trustee"
"1720","has a direct or indirect financial interest, (ii) an amendment of the Declaration of Trust, (iii) a"
"1721","reorganization of the Trust, or (iv) a voluntary dissolution of the Trust, the notice shall also state the"
"1722","general nature of that proposal."
"1723","Section 4.  Manner of Giving Notice; Affidavit of Notice"
"1724","Notice of any meeting of shareholders shall be given either personally or by first-class mail or telegraphic or"
"1725","other written communication, charges prepaid, addressed to the shareholder at the address of that shareholder"
"1726","appearing on the books of the Trust or its transfer agent or given by the shareholder to the Trust for the"
"1727","purpose of notice.  If no such address appears on the Trust's books or is given, notice shall be deemed to have"
"1728","been given if sent to that shareholder by first-class mail or telegraphic or other written communication to the"
"1729","Trust's principal executive office, or if published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the"
"1730","county where that office is located.  Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered"
"1731","personally or deposited in the mail or sent by telegram or other means of written communication."
"1732","If any notice addressed to a shareholder at the address of that shareholder appearing on the books of the Trust"
"1733","is returned to the Trust by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the Postal Service is unable"
"1734","to deliver the notice to the shareholder at the address, all future notices or reports shall be deemed to have"
"1735","been duly given without further mailing if these shall be available to the shareholder on written demand of the"
"1736","shareholder at the principal executive office of the Trust for a period of one year from the date of the giving"
"1737","of the notice."
"1738","An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any shareholder's meeting shall be executed by"
"1739","the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary or any transfer agent of the Trust giving the notice and shall be filed and"
"1740","maintained in the minute book of the Trust."
"1741","Section 5.  Adjourned Meeting; Notice"
"1742","Any shareholder's meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of"
"1743","the majority of the shares represented at that meeting, either in person or by proxy."
"1744","When any meeting of shareholders is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned"
"1745","meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless a new record date of the adjourned meeting is fixed or unless"
"1746","the adjournment is for more than sixty (60) days from the date set for the original meeting, in which case the"
"1747","Board of Trustees shall set a new record date.  Where required, notice of any such adjourned meeting shall be"
"1748","given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance with the provisions"
"1749","of Section 3 and 4 of this Article II.  At any adjourned meeting, the Trust may transact any business which might"
"1750","have been transacted at the original meeting."
"1751","Section 6.  Voting"
"1752","The shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders shall be determined in accordance with the"
"1753","provisions of the Declaration of Trust, as in effect at such time.  The shareholders' vote may be by voice vote"
"1754","or by ballot, provided, however, that any election for trustees must be by ballot if demanded by any shareholder"
"1755","before the voting has begun.  On any matter other than elections of trustees, any shareholder may vote part of"
"1756","the shares in favor of the proposal and refrain from voting the remaining shares or vote them against the"
"1757","proposal, but if the shareholder fails to specify the number of shares which the shareholder is voting"
"1758","affirmatively, it will be conclusively presumed that the shareholder's approving vote is with respect to the"
"1759","total shares that the shareholder is entitled to vote on such proposal."
"1760","Section 7.  Waiver of Notice by Consent of Absent Shareholders"
"1761","The transactions of the meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed and wherever held, shall be as valid"
"1762","as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice if a quorum be present either in person or by"
"1763","proxy and if either before or after the meeting, each person entitled to vote who was not present in person or by"
"1764","proxy signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to a holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes."
"1765","The waiver of notice or consent need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of any"
"1766","meeting of shareholders."
"1767","Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of that meeting, except when the"
"1768","person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not"
"1769","lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the"
"1770","consideration of matters not included in the notice of the meeting if that objection is expressly made at the"
"1771","beginning of the meeting."
"1772","Section 8.  Shareholder Action by Written Consent without a Meeting"
"1773","Any action which may be taken at any meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior"
"1774","notice if a consent in writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by the holders of outstanding shares"
"1775","having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take that action at a"
"1776","meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on that action were present and voted.  All such consents shall be"
"1777","filed with the Secretary of the Trust and shall be maintained in the Trust's records.  Any shareholder giving a"
"1778","written consent or the shareholder's proxy holders or a transferee of the shares or a personal representative of"
"1779","the shareholder or their respective proxy holders may revoke the consent by a writing received by the Secretary"
"1780","of the Trust before written consents of the number of shares required to authorize the proposed action have been"
"1781","filed with the Secretary."
"1782","If the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have not been solicited in writing and if the unanimous"
"1783","written consent of all such shareholders shall not have been received, the Secretary shall give prompt notice of"
"1784","the action approved by the shareholders without a meeting.  This notice shall be given in the manner specified in"
"1785","Section 4 of this Article II.  In the case of approval of (i) contracts or transactions in which a trustee has a"
"1786","direct or indirect financial interest, (ii) indemnification of agents of the Trust, and (iii) a reorganization of"
"1787","the Trust, the notice shall be given at least ten (10) days before the consummation of any action authorized by"
"1788","that approval."
"1789","Section 9.  Record Date for Shareholder Notice, Voting and Giving Consents"
"1790","For purposes of determining the shareholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote or entitled to give"
"1791","consent to action without a meeting, the Board of Trustees may fix in advance a record date which shall not be"
"1792","more than seventy-five (75) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting as provided in"
"1793","the Declaration of Trust."
"1794","If the Board of Trustees does not so fix a record date:"
"1795","(a)      The record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of"
"1796","         shareholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which"
"1797","         notice is given or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the"
"1798","         day on which the meeting is held."
"1799","(b)      The record date for determining shareholders entitled to give consent to action in writing without a"
"1800","         meeting, (i) when no prior action by the Board of Trustees has been taken, shall be the day on which the"
"1801","         first written consent is given, or (ii) when prior action of the Board of Trustees has been taken, shall"
"1802","         be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Trustees adopt the resolution relating to"
"1803","         that action or the seventy-fifth day before the date of such other action, whichever is later."
"1804","Section 10.  Proxies"
"1805","Every person entitled to vote for trustees or on any other matter shall have the right to do so either in person"
"1806","or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the Secretary of the"
"1807","Trust.  A proxy shall be deemed signed if the shareholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual"
"1808","signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission, or by electronic, telephonic, computerized or other alternative"
"1809","form of execution authorized by the Trustees) by the shareholder or the shareholder's attorney-in-fact.  A proxy"
"1810","with respect to Shares held in the name of two or more persons shall be valid if executed by one of them unless"
"1811","at or prior to exercise of such proxy the Trust receives specific written notice to the contrary from any one of"
"1812","them.  A proxy purporting to be exercised by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless"
"1813","challenged at or prior to its exercise and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger.  A"
"1814","validly executed proxy which does not state that it is irrevocable shall continue in full force and effect unless"
"1815","(i) revoked by the person executing it before the vote pursuant to that proxy by a writing delivered to the Trust"
"1816","stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or attendance at the meeting and voting"
"1817","in person by the person executing that proxy; or (ii) written notice of the death or incapacity of the maker of"
"1818","that proxy is received by the Trust before the vote pursuant to that proxy is counted; provided however, that no"
"1819","proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven (11) months from the date of the proxy unless otherwise"
"1820","provided in the proxy.  The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be"
"1821","governed by the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as if the Trust"
"1822","were a Massachusetts corporation."
"1823","Section 11.  Inspectors of Election"
"1824","Before any meeting of shareholders, the Board of Trustees may appoint any persons other than nominees for office"
"1825","to act as inspectors of election at the meeting or its adjournment.  If no inspectors of election are so"
"1826","appointed, the chairman of the meeting may and on the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's proxy shall,"
"1827","appoint inspectors of election at the meeting.  The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3)."
"1828","If inspectors are appointed at a meeting on the request of one or more shareholders or proxies, the holders of a"
"1829","majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3)"
"1830","inspectors are to be appointed.  If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act,"
"1831","the chairman of the meeting may and on the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's proxy, shall appoint a"
"1832","person to fill the vacancy."
"1833","These inspectors shall:"
"1834","(a)      Determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares represented at the"
"1835","         meeting, the existence of a quorum and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies;"
"1836","(b)      Receive votes, ballots or consents;"
"1837","(c)      Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;"
"1838","(d)      Count and tabulate all votes or consents;"
"1839","(e)      Determine when the polls shall close;"
"1840","(f)      Determine the result; and"
"1841","(g)      Do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all shareholders."
"1842","                                                    ARTICLE III"

"1844","Section 1.  Powers"
"1845","Subject to the applicable provisions of the Declaration of Trust, these Bylaws, and applicable laws relating to"
"1846","action required to be approved by the shareholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the"
"1847","Trust shall be managed and all powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the Board of Trustees."
"1848","Section 2.  Number and Qualification of Trustees"
"1849","The authorized number of trustees shall be not less than three (3) nor more than fifteen (15) until changed by a"
"1850","duly adopted amendment to the Declaration of Trust and these Bylaws.  The selection and nomination of"
"1851","disinterested trustees is committed solely to the discretion of a Nominating Committee consisting of all sitting"
"1852","disinterested trustees except where the remaining trustee or trustees are interested persons."
"1853","Section 3.  Mandatory Retirement"
"1854","Disinterested trustees shall retire when they reach the age of seventy-three (73) years; provided, however, the"
"1855","remaining disinterested trustees may waive the mandatory retirement provision expressed herein for a period not"
"1856","to exceed two years."
"1857","Section 4.  Vacancies"
"1858","Vacancies in the Board of Trustees may be filled by a majority of the remaining trustees, though less than a"
"1859","quorum, or by a sole remaining trustee, unless the Board of Trustees calls a meeting of shareholders for the"
"1860","purposes of electing trustees.  In the event that at any time less than a majority of the trustees holding office"
"1861","at that time were so elected by the holders of the outstanding voting securities of the Trust, the Board of"
"1862","Trustees shall forthwith cause to be held as promptly as possible, and in any event within sixty (60) days, a"
"1863","meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing trustees to fill any existing vacancies in the Board of"
"1864","Trustees, unless such period is extended by order of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission."
"1865","Section 5.  Place of Meetings and Meetings by Telephone"
"1866","All meetings of the Board of Trustees may be held at any place within or outside The Commonwealth of"
"1867","Massachusetts that has been designated from time to time by resolution of the Board.  In the absence of such a"
"1868","designation, regular meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the Trust.  Any meeting, regular"
"1869","or special, may be held by conference telephone or similar communication equipment, so long as all trustees"
"1870","participating in the meeting can hear one another and all such trustees shall be deemed to be present in person"
"1871","at the meeting; provided that, in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Board"
"1872","may not transact by such a meeting any business which involves the entering into, or the approval, performance,"
"1873","or renewal of any contract or agreement, whereby a person undertakes regularly to serve or act as the Trust's"
"1874","investment advisor or principal underwriter."
"1875","Section 6.  Regular Meetings"
"1876","Regular meetings of the Board of Trustees shall be held without call at such time as shall from time to time be"
"1877","fixed by the Board of Trustees.  Such regular meetings may be held without notice."
"1878","Section 7.  Special Meetings"
"1879","Special meetings of the Board of Trustees for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Chairman"
"1880","of the Board or the President or any Vice President or the Secretary or any two (2) trustees."
"1881","Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be delivered personally or by telephone to each trustee or"
"1882","sent by first-class mail, by facsimile, or electronic mail, charges prepaid, addressed to each trustee at that"
"1883","trustee's address as it is shown on the records of the Trust.  In case the notice is mailed, it shall be"
"1884","deposited in the United States mail at least four (4) days before the time of the holding of the meeting.  In"
"1885","case the notice is delivered personally, by telephone, by facsimile delivery, or by electronic mail, it shall be"
"1886","given at least forty-eight (48) hours before the time of the holding of the meeting.  Any oral notice given"
"1887","personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the trustee or to a person at the office of the trustee"
"1888","who the person giving the notice  has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the trustee.  The notice"
"1889","need not specify the purpose of the meeting or the place if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive"
"1890","office of the Trust."
"1891","Section 8.  Quorum"
"1892","A majority of the number of trustees (as fixed in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust)"
"1893","shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except to adjourn as provided in Section 10 of this"
"1894","Article III.  Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the trustees present at a meeting duly held at"
"1895","which a quorum is present shall be regarded as the act of the Board of Trustees, subject to the provisions of the"
"1896","Declaration of Trust.  A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business"
"1897","notwithstanding the withdrawal of trustees if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required"
"1898","quorum for that meeting."
"1899","Section 9.  Waiver of Notice"
"1900","Notice of any meeting need not be given to any trustee who either before or after the meeting signs a written"
"1901","waiver of notice, a consent to holding the meeting or an approval of the minutes.  The waiver of notice of"
"1902","consent need not specify the purpose of the meeting.  All such waivers, consents and approvals shall be filed"
"1903","with the records of the Trust or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.  Notice of a meeting shall also be"
"1904","deemed given to any trustee who attends the meeting without protesting before or at its commencement the lack of"
"1905","notice to that trustee."
"1906","Section 10.  Adjournment"
"1907","A majority of the trustees present, whether or not constituting a quorum, may adjourn any meeting to another time"
"1908","and place."
"1909","Section 11.  Notice of Adjournment"
"1910","Notice of the time and place of holding an adjourned meeting need not be given unless the meeting is adjourned"
"1911","for more than forty-eight (48) hours, in which case notice of the time and place shall be given before the time"
"1912","of the adjourned meeting in the manner specified in Section 6 of this Article III to the trustees who were"
"1913","present at the time of the adjournment."
"1914","Section 12.  Action without a Meeting"
"1915","Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board of Trustees may be taken without a meeting if a"
"1916","majority of the members of the Board of Trustees shall individually or collectively consent in writing to that"
"1917","action; provided that, in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940, such written consent does not"
"1918","approve the entering into, or the renewal or performance of any contract or agreement, whereby a person"

may at any time discontinue the issuance of share certificates for such series and may, by written notice to such
shareholders of such series require the surrender of their shares certificates to the Trust for cancellation,

for the record holders of such shares, who shall in either case be deemed, for all purposes hereunder to be the
