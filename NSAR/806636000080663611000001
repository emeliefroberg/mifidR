"987","Telephone (410) 783 7600"
"988","Facsimile (410) 783 7680"
"989","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"990","To the Trustees of Longleaf Partners Funds"
"991","Trust and Shareholders of Longleaf Partners"
"992","Fund, Longleaf Partners Small-Cap Fund, and"
"993","Longleaf Partners International Fund"
"994","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"995","statements of Longleaf Partners Funds Trust (comprised"
"996","of Longleaf Partners Fund,"
"997","Longleaf Partners Small-Cap Fund,"
"998","and Longleaf Partners International Fund, hereafter"
"999","referred to as the Funds)"
"1000","as of and for the year ended"
"1001","December 31, 2010, in accordance with the"
"1002","standards of the Public"
"1003","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"1004","we considered the Funds internal control over"
"1005","financial reporting, including control activities"
"1006","for safeguarding securities, as a"
"1007","basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1008","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1009","financial statements and to comply with the"
"1010","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"1011","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"1012","the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"1013","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1014","effectiveness of the Companys internal control"
"1015","over financial reporting."
"1016","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"1017","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1018","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"1019","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1020","management are required to assess the expected"
"1021","benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"1022","funds internal control over financial"
"1023","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1024","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1025","reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1026","for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1027","accepted accounting principles. A funds internal"
"1028","control over financial reporting includes policies and"
"1029","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1030","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1031","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"1032","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1033","assurance that transactions and recorded as necessary to"
"1034","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"1035","with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1036","that receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"1037","being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1038","management and Trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"1039","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1040","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1041","of a companys assets that could have a material effect"
"1042","on the financial statements."
"1043","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1044","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"1045","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1046","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"1047","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1048","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"1049","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1050","procedures may deteriorate."
"1051","A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or"
"1052","operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1053","employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"1054","assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1055","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is"
"1056","a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"1057","internal control over financial reporting, such that"
"1058","there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1059","misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial"
"1060","statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1061","on a timely basis."
"1062","Our consideration of the Funds internal control"
"1063","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1064","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1065","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1066","control over financial reporting that"
"1067","might be material weaknesses"
"1068","under standards established by the Public Company"
"1069","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1070","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds"
"1071","internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1072","operation, including controls for safeguarding"
"1073","securities, that we consider to be material"
"1074","weaknesses as defined above as of December"
"1075","31, 2010."
"1076","This report is intended solely for the information"
"1077","and use of management and the Trustees"
"1078","of the Longleaf Partners Funds Trust and the"
