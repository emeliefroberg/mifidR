"2093","<TEXT>"
"2094","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2095","The Shareholders and Board of Directors of Tributary Funds, Inc.:"
"2096","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of each series"
"2097","within  Tributary  Funds,  Inc., consisting of Tributary Short-Intermediate Bond"
"2098","Fund,  Tributary  Income  Fund,  Tributary  Balanced Fund, Tributary Core Equity"
"2099","Fund,  Tributary  Large Cap Growth Fund, Tributary Growth Opportunities Fund and"
"2100","Tributary Small Company Fund  (the Funds) as of and for the period ended March"
"2101","31,  2012  in  accordance  with  the  standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"2102","Oversight  Board  (United  States),  we  considered  the  internal  control over"
"2103","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"2104","for  designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"2105","on  the  financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"2106","but  not  for  the  purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"2107","Funds'  internal  control  over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"2108","such  opinion."
"2109","The  management  of  the  Funds  is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2110","effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  In  fulfilling  this"
"2111","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"2112","expected  benefits  and  related costs of controls.  The Funds' internal control"
"2113","over  financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2114","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"2115","financial  statements  for  external  purposes in accordance with U.S. generally"
"2116","accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP).  The  Funds'  internal  control  over"
"2117","financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"2118","the  maintenance  of  records  that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2119","reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets of the Funds; (2)"
"2120","provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to"
"2121","permit  preparation  of  financial  statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"2122","receipts  and  expenditures  of the Funds are being made only in accordance with"
"2123","authorizations of management and Board of Managers of the Funds; and (3) provide"
"2124","reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"2125","acquisition, use, or disposition of the Funds' assets that could have a material"
"2126","effect  on  the  financial  statements."
"2127","Because  of  its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2128","may  not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2129","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2130","inadequate  because  of  changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"2131","with  the  policies  or  procedures  may  deteriorate."
"2132","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"2133","or  operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"2134","course  of  performing  their  assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"2135","misstatements  on  a  timely  basis.  A  material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2136","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2137","that  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that a material misstatement of the"
"2138","Funds'  annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"2139","on  a  timely  basis."
"2140","Our  consideration  of  the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"2141","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the  first  paragraph  and  would not"
"2142","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"2143","weaknesses  under  standards  established  by  the  Public  Company  Accounting"
"2144","Oversight  Board  (United  States).  However,  we  noted  no deficiencies in the"
"2145","Funds'  internal  control  over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"2146","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness"
"2147","as  defined  above  as  of     March  31,  2012."
"2148","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"2149","Board  of  Directors of the Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and"
"2150","is  not  intended  to  be  and  should  not  be  used by anyone other than these"
"2151","specified  parties."

"2196","Board  of  Directors  (the Board) and the Adviser, in addition to the terms of"
"2197","                            -----"
"2198","the  Advisory  Agreement,  the  Sub-Adviser  will  furnish an investment program"

"2290","     4.     Books  and  Records.  In  compliance  with  the requirements of Rule"

"2303","     6.     Compensation.  For  the  services  to be provided by the Sub-Adviser"
"2304","            ------------"
"2305","pursuant  to  this  Agreement,  the  Adviser  will  pay the Sub-Adviser, and the"
"2306","Sub-Adviser agrees to accept as full compensation thereof, a sub-advisory fee at"
"2307","an  annual  rate  of  0.25%  of  the  average  daily net assets of the Tributary"
"2308","Short-Intermediate  Income Fund and 0.30% of the average daily net assets of the"
"2309","Tributary Income Fund, paid at the same time and in the same manner as the Funds"
"2310","pays  the Adviser its advisory fee pursuant to the Advisory Agreement.  This fee"
"2311","will be computed daily and paid to the Sub-Adviser monthly.  The Sub-Adviser may"
"2312","agree  to  waive  a  portion  of its fee.  Any fee waiver for the Sub-Adviser is"
"2313","voluntary  and  will  be  mutually  agreed upon with the Adviser.  For any month"
"2314","during  which  this  Agreement  becomes  effective and the month during which it"
"2315","terminates,  however, there shall be an appropriate proration of the fee payable"
"2316","for  such  month based on the number of calendar days of such month during which"
"2317","this  Agreement  is  effective."
"2318","     7.     Services  to  Others.  Adviser  understands that the Sub-Adviser now"
"2319","            --------------------"
"2320","acts, and may in the future act, as an investment adviser to fiduciary and other"
"2321","managed  accounts,  and  as  investment  adviser, sub-investment adviser, and/or"
"2322","administrator  to  other  investment companies.  Adviser has no objection to the"
"2323","Sub-Adviser's  acting  in  such capacities, provided that whenever the Funds and"
"2324","one or more other investment companies advised by the Sub-Adviser have available"
"2325","funds  for  investment,  investments  suitable  and appropriate for each will be"
"2326","allocated  in  accordance  with  a  formula  believed  by  the Sub-Adviser to be"
"2327","equitable  to  each  company.  In addition, Adviser understands that the persons"
"2328","employed  by  the  Sub-Adviser  to assist in the Sub-Adviser's duties under this"
"2329","Agreement will not devote their full time to such service, and nothing contained"
"2330","in  this  Agreement  will  be  deemed  to  limit  or  restrict  the right of the"
"2331","Sub-Adviser  or any of its affiliates to engage in and devote time and attention"
"2332","to  other  businesses  or  to  render  services  of  whatever  kind  or  nature."
"2333","     8.     Standard  of Care.  The Sub-Adviser shall discharge its duties under"
"2334","            -----------------"
"2335","this  Agreement  with  the  care,  skill,  prudence,  and  diligence  under  the"
"2336","circumstances  then  prevailing  that a prudent person acting in a like capacity"
"2337","and  familiar  with  such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a"
"2338","like  character  and  with  like  aims.  The  federal  securities  laws  impose"
"2339","liabilities  under  certain  circumstances on persons who act in good faith, and"
"2340","therefore  nothing  herein shall in any way constitute a waiver or limitation of"
"2341","any  rights  which  the  Adviser  may have against Sub-Adviser under any federal"
