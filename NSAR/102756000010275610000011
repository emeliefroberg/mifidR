"500","On November 4, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Value"
"501","Line, Inc. (VLI), Value Line Securities, Inc. (currently, EULAV Securities,"
"502","Inc. (ESI or the Distributor)), Jean B. Buttner, former Chairman,"
"503","President and Chief Executive Officer of VLI and David Henigson,"
"504","a former Director and Officer of VLI, settled a matter related"
"505","to brokerage commissions charged by ESI to certain"
"506","Value Line mutual funds (Funds), including the Fund"
"507","from 1986 through November of 2004. The"
"508","matter also involved alleged misleading disclosures provided by VLI to the"
"509","Boards of Directors/Trustees and shareholders of the Funds regarding such"
"510","brokerage commissions. VLI agreed to pay disgorgement in the amount of"
"511","$24,168,979 (representing disgorgement of commissions received), prejudgment"
"512","interest of $9,536,786, and a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000,000."
"513","Also as part of the settlement, Mrs. Buttner and Mr. Henigson each agreed"
"514","to pay a civil penalty, are barred from association with any broker, dealer"
"515","or investment adviser, and are prohibited from serving as an employee,"
"516","officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser or depositor"
"517"," of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company or"
"518","affiliated person of such investment adviser, depositor, or principal"
"519","underwriter, subject to a limited exception (limited in scope and for a"
"520","one-year period) for Mrs. Buttner. Pursuant to Section 308(a) of the"
"521","Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a fund will be created for VLIs disgorgement,"
"522","interest and penalty (Fair Fund). VLI will bear all costs associated with any"
"523","Fair Fund distribution, including retaining a third-party consultant approved"
"524","by the SEC staff to administer any Fair Fund distribution.  VLI informed the"
"525","Funds Board that it has paid the settlement, continues to have adequate"
"526","liquid assets, and that the resolution of this matter will not have a"
"527","materially adverse effect on the ability of EULAV Asset Management LLC"
"528","(EULAV or the Adviser), the Funds investment adviser, or ESI, the"
"529","Funds distributor, to perform their respective contracts with the Funds."

"536","<DESCRIPTION>REPORT OF INTERNAL CONTROL"
"537","<TEXT>"
"538","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"539","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders"
"540","of The Value Line Fund, Inc."
"541","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of The"
"542","Value Line Fund, Inc. (the Fund) as of and for the year ended December"
"543","31, 2009, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"544","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal control"
"545","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"546","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"547","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"548","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"549","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"550","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness"
"551","of the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"552","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"553","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"554","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"555","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds"
"556","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"557","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"558","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"559","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A funds internal control"
"560","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"561","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"562","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"563","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"564","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"565","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"566","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance"
"567","with authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and (3)"
"568","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"569","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a funds assets that"
"570","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"571","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"572","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"573","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"574","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"575","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"576","deteriorate."
"577","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"578","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"579","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"580","or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"581","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"582","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"583","material misstatement of the Funds annual or interim financial"
"584","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"585","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting"
"586","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"587","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"588","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"589","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"590","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal control over financial"
"591","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"592","securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above"
"593","as of December 31, 2009."
"594","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"595","and the Board of Directors of The Value Line Fund, Inc. and the Securities"
"596","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used"
"597","by anyone other than these specified parties."
