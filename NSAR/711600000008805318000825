"1073","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"1074","Accounting Firm"
"1075","To the Board of Trustees of Deutsche DWS Tax Free Trust"
"1076","and Shareholders of the DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free"
"1077","Fund"
"1078","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1079","statements of the DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund"
"1080","(the Fund), as of and for the year ended May 31, 2018, in"
"1081","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1082","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1083","considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1084","reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"1085","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"1086","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1087","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"1088","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"1089","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"1090","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"1091","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"1092","over financial reporting."
"1093","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1094","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1095","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1096","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"1097","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1098","A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1099","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1100","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1101","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"1102","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1103","principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1104","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"1105","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1106","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1107","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1108","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1109","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1110","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,"
"1111","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"1112","made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1113","management and trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide"
"1114","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1115","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1116","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1117","financial statements."
"1118","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1119","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1120","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1121","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"1122","controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1123","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1124","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1125","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1126","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1127","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1128","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1129","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1130","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1131","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1132","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1133","Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1134","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1135","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over"
"1136","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"1137","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"1138","all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting"
"1139","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1140","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1141","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1142","in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and"
"1143","its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1144","securities, which we consider to be material weaknesses as"
"1145","defined above as of May 31, 2018."

"1161","Item 77D - 	DWS Intermediate Tax/AMT Free"
"1162","Fund (formerly Deutsche"
"1163","Intermediate Tax/AMT Free Fund)"
"1164","(a series of Deutsche DWS Tax Free"
"1165","Trust (formerly Deutsche Tax Free"
"1166","Trust)) (the fund)"
"1167","On or about August 2, 2018, the fund will be"
"1168","renamed DWS Intermediate Tax-Free Fund and"
"1169","the fund's principal investment strategy will be"
"1170","amended to include the following:"
"1171","Main investments. Under normal circumstances,"
"1172","the fund invests at least 80% of net assets, plus the"
"1173","amount of any borrowings for investment purposes,"
"1174","in securities issued by municipalities across the"
"1175","United States and in other securities whose income"
"1176","is free from regular federal income tax and"
"1177","alternative minimum tax (AMT). The fund may"
"1178","invest up to 20% of net assets in securities whose"
"1179","income is subject to AMT."
"1180","The fund can buy many types of municipal"
"1181","securities of all maturities. These may include"
"1182","revenue bonds (which are backed by revenues from"
"1183","a particular source) and general obligation bonds"
"1184","(which are typically backed by the issuer's ability to"
"1185","levy taxes). They may also include municipal lease"
"1186","obligations and investments representing an interest"
"1187","therein."
"1188","This fund normally invests at least 65% of total"
"1189","assets in municipal securities of the top three grades"
"1190","of credit quality. The fund could invest up to 35%"
"1191","of total assets in debt securities rated in the fourth"
"1192","credit grade, which is still considered investment-"
"1193","grade. The fund may invest up to 10% of total"
"1194","assets in high yield debt securities (commonly"
"1195","referred to as junk bonds) of the fifth and sixth"
"1196","credit grades (i.e., as low as grade B). Compared to"
"1197","investment-grade debt securities, junk bonds"
"1198","generally pay higher yields, have higher volatility"
"1199","and higher risk of default on payments of interest or"
"1200","principal."
"1201","The fund may also invest in exchange-traded funds"
"1202","(ETFs). The fund's investments in ETFs will be"
"1203","limited to 5% of total assets in any one ETF and"
"1204","10% of total assets in the aggregate in ETFs."
