"1036","Fund and Tweedy, Browne Global Value Fund II - Currency"
"1037","Unhedged (constituting the Tweedy, Browne Fund Inc., hereafter"
"1038","referred to as the Fund) as of and for the year ended March"
"1039","31, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1040","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1041","considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1042","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"1043","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"1044","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1045","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1046","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1047","Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"1048","we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1049","internal control over financial reporting."
"1050","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1051","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1052","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1053","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1054","benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"1055","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1056","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1057","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1058","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1059","accounting principles.  A company's internal control over"
"1060","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"1061","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1062","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1063","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1064","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1065","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1066","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1067","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"1068","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1069","directors of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance"
"1070","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1071","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"1072","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1073","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1074","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1075","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1076","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1077","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1078","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1079","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1080","exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1081","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1082","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"1083","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1084","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1085","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1086","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial"
"1087","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1088","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1089","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1090","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"1091","in internal control over financial reporting that might be"
"1092","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"1093","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"1094","we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over"
"1095","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1096","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"1097","weaknesses as defined above as of March 31, 2017."

"1117","Exhibit 77e-Litigation"
"1118","1. The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Tribune"
"1119","Company (the Committee) initiated litigation against Tweedy,"
"1120","Browne Value Fund (the Value Fund) and thousands of other"
"1121","former public shareholders of Tribune Company, seeking to avoid"
"1122","and recover payments made to Tribune Company shareholders in"
"1123","connection with the 2007 leveraged buyout of Tribune Company."
"1124","Value Fund tendered its shares in a tender offer from Tribune"
"1125","Company and received proceeds of approximately $3.4 million. The"
"1126","Committee, which was replaced during 2012 as plaintiff in this"
"1127","action by a litigation trustee (the Litigation Trustee),"
"1128","alleges that the shareholder payments were made in violation of"
"1129","various laws prohibiting actual fraudulent transfers (the AFT
Litigation). A fifth amended complaint filed on August 1, 2013"
"1130","by the Litigation Trustee alleges no misconduct by Value Fund or"
"1131","any member of the putative defendant class of public"
"1132","shareholders. A scheduling order was entered by the District"
"1133","Court on April 25, 2014 related to a motion to dismiss the"
"1134","entire case contemplated by certain primary defendants."
"1135","Briefing in connection with this potentially case dispositive"
"1136","motion was completed on July 3, 2014.  On January 6, 2017, the"
"1137","District Court issued a decision dismissing the Litigation"
"1138","Trustee's actual fraudulent conveyance claims related to the"
"1139","shareholder transfers.  On February 1, 2017, the Litigation"
"1140","Trustee's counsel wrote to the Court requesting leave to file a"
"1141","motion for certification of the Court's January 6 opinion"
"1142","pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
"1143","On February 6, 2017, certain defendants filed a response to the"
"1144","Litigation Trustee's request for certification.  On February 23,"
"1145","2017, the District Court issued an order wherein it stated that"
"1146","an interlocutory appeal is appropriate; however, it will not"
"1147","grant certification until the remaining motions to dismiss are"
"1148","resolved.  The timetable for a decision on the remaining motions"
"1149","to dismiss is unknown.  No contingency has been recorded on the"
"1150","books of Value Fund."
"1151","Name of court in which proceedings were instituted: United"
"1152","States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. This"
"1153","proceeding was transferred by order of the United States"
"1154","Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to the United States"
"1155","District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 5,"
"1156","2012 and remains pending. A scheduling order was entered by the"
"1157","Court on April 25, 2014 related to a motion to dismiss the"
"1158","entire case contemplated by certain primary defendants. Briefing"
"1159","in connection with this potentially case dispositive motion was"
"1160","completed on July 3, 2014. The timetable for a decision is"
"1161","unknown."
"1162","Date instituted: November 1, 2010."
"1163","Principal parties: Marc S. Kirschner, as Litigation Trustee for"
"1164","the Tribune Litigation Trust vs. FitzSimons et. al., S.D.N.Y."
"1165","Civil Case Number - 1:12-cv-02652 (RJS)."
"1166","2. In addition to the AFT Litigation, a second proceeding,"
"1167","commenced by certain holders of notes issued by Tribune Company,"
"1168","asserts litigation claims against Value Fund and other public"
"1169","shareholders of Tribune Company, seeking to recover payments"
"1170","made to Tribune Company shareholders in connection with the 2007"
"1171","leveraged buyout of Tribune Company. The plaintiffs in this"
"1172","second action allege that the shareholder payments were made in"
"1173","violation of various laws prohibiting constructive fraudulent"
"1174","transfers. The complaint alleges no misconduct by Value Fund or"
"1175","any member of the putative defendant class. The outcome of the"
"1176","proceedings (the Niese Litigation) cannot be predicted at this"
"1177","time and no contingency has been recorded on the books of Value"
"1178","Fund. On September 23, 2013, Judge Richard Sullivan issued a"
"1179","Memorandum and Order granting defendants' Omnibus Phase One"
"1180","Motion to Dismiss the state law fraudulent conveyance claims in"
"1181","the Niese Litigation on grounds that the automatic stay under"
"1182","Section 362(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code precludes fraudulent"
"1183","conveyance actions by individual creditors (like the plaintiffs"
"1184","in the Niese Litigation) as long as the Litigation Trustee in"
"1185","the AFT Litigation continues to assert his avoidance powers."
"1186","During October 2013, Judge Sullivan's decision was appealed by"
"1187","both plaintiffs and defendants to the U.S. Court of Appeals for"
"1188","the Second Circuit. On November 5, 2014, after briefing was"
"1189","completed, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral"
"1190","arguments. On March 29, 2016 the Second Circuit issued its"
"1191","revised opinion affirming the District Court's dismissal of the"
"1192","complaint on preemption rather than standing grounds.  The"
"1193","Second Circuit held that the noteholders have statutory standing"
"1194","because the bankruptcy court granted the noteholders relief from"
"1195","the automatic stay on three occasions. However, the Second"
"1196","Circuit found that the noteholders' state law constructive"
"1197","fraudulent conveyance claims are preempted by the safe harbor in"
"1198","Section 546(e) of the Bankruptcy Code.  On April 12, 2016, the"
"1199","plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing with the Second"
"1200","Circuit and on July 22, 2016, the Second Circuit issued an order"
"1201","denying plaintiffs' petition for rehearing.  On September 9,"
"1202","2016, the noteholders filed a petition for writ of certiorari in"
"1203","the United States Supreme Court concerning, among other things,"
"1204","the question of whether the Second Circuit properly applied the"
"1205","safe harbor in Section 546(e) of the Bankruptcy Code to the"
"1206","noteholders' claims.  Responses to the petition for writ of"
"1207","certiorari were filed on November 4, 2016.  The timetable for a"
"1208","decision is unknown.  No contingency has been recorded on the"
"1209","books of Value Fund."

"1221","The plaintiffs allege that the shareholder payments were made in"

"1225","proceedings (the Deutsche Bank Litigation) cannot be predicted"
"1226","at this time and no contingency has been recorded on the books"
"1227","of Value Fund. On September 23, 2013, Judge Richard Sullivan"
"1228","issued a Memorandum and Order granting defendants' Omnibus Phase"
"1229","One Motion to Dismiss the state law fraudulent conveyance claims"
"1230","in the Deutsche Bank Litigation on grounds that the automatic"
"1231","stay under Section 362(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code precludes"

"1233","plaintiffs in the Deutsche Bank Litigation) as long as the"
"1234","Litigation Trustee in the AFT Litigation continues to assert his"
"1235","avoidance powers. During October 2013, Judge Sullivan's decision"
"1236","was appealed by both plaintiffs and defendants to the U.S. Court"
"1237","of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On November 5, 2014, after"
