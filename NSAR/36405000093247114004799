"2867","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"2868","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"2869","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"2870","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"2871","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"2872","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"2873","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"2874","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"2875","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of"

"2879","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"

"2882","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"2883","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"2884","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"2885","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"2886","company's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"2887","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"2888","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"2889","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"

"2902","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"2903","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"2904","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2905","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"2906","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"

"2914","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
