"1760","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1761","To the Board of Trustees of Franklin Value Investors Trust and"
"1762","Shareholders of the Franklin Balance Sheet Investment Fund,"
"1763","Franklin MicroCap Value Fund, Franklin MidCap Value Fund, and"
"1764","Franklin Small Cap Value Fund:"
"1765","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"1766","of Franklin Balance Sheet Investment Fund,"
"1767","Franklin MicroCap Value Fund, Franklin MidCap Value Fund,"
"1768","and Franklin Small Cap Value Fund (the Funds) as of and"
"1769","for the year ended October 31, 2017, in accordance with the"
"1770","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1771","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"1772","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"1773","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1774","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"1775","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"1776","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"1777","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"1778","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"1779","financial reporting."
"1780","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1781","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1782","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1783","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"1784","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1785","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1786","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1787","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1788","generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control"
"1789","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"1790","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1791","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1792","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1793","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1794","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1795","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"1796","of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1797","management and trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"1798","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1799","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a"
"1800","material effect on the financial statements."
"1801","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1802","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"1803","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1804","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1805","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1806","procedures may deteriorate."
"1807","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1808","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"1809","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1810","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"1811","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1812","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1813","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1814","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements"
"1815","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1816","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1817","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1818","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"1819","in internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1820","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1821","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"1822","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"1823","and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities"
"1824","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above"
"1825","as of October 31, 2017."

"1891","(ii) the distribution of Small Cap Fund Shares to the holders"
"1892","of Class A, Class C, Class R and Advisor Class shares of"
"1893","beneficial interest, with no par value, of MidCap Fund"
"1894","(the MidCap Fund Shares), respectively, according to their"
"1895","respective interests in MidCap Fund, in complete liquidation"
"1896","of MidCap Fund; and (iii) the dissolution of MidCap Fund as"

"1903","the premises and of the covenants and agreements hereinafter set"
"1904","forth, FVIT covenants and agrees as follows:"
"1905","1.  Sale and Transfer of Assets, Liquidation and Dissolution"
"1906","of MidCap Fund."
"1907","(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, and in reliance"
"1908","on the representations and warranties herein contained, and in"
"1909","consideration of the delivery by Small Cap Fund of the number of"
"1910","Small Cap Fund Shares hereinafter provided, FVIT, on behalf of"

"1941","securities described above."
"1942","(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, and in reliance"
"1943","on the representations and warranties herein contained, and in"
"1944","consideration of such sale, conveyance, transfer, and delivery,"
"1945","FVIT, on behalf of Small Cap Fund, agrees at the Closing to deliver"
"1946","to MidCap Fund the number of Small Cap Fund Shares, determined by"
"1947","dividing the net asset value per share of each Class A, Class C,"

"1955","an aggregate net asset value equal to the value of MidCap Fund's"
"1956","Net Assets, all determined as provided in Section 2 of the Plan"
"1957","and as of the date and time specified herein."
"1958","(c) Immediately following the Closing, MidCap Fund shall distribute"
"1959","the Small Cap Fund Shares received by MidCap Fund pursuant to this"
"1960","Section 1 pro rata to MidCap Fund's shareholders of record, based"
"1961","upon their respective holdings of MidCap Fund, as of the close of"
"1962","business on the Closing Date.  Such distribution shall be"
"1963","accomplished by the establishment of accounts on the share records"
"1964","of Small Cap Fund of the type and in the amounts due such"
"1965","shareholders based on their respective holdings in MidCap Fund as"
"1966","of the close of business on the Closing Date.  Fractional Small"
"1967","Cap Fund Shares shall be carried to the third decimal place."
"1968","As of the Closing, any outstanding certificate or certificates"
"1969","representing MidCap Fund Shares shall be canceled.  Certificates"
"1970","for Small Cap Fund Shares shall not be issued.  After the"

"1975","prior to the Closing, including any dividend or distribution"
"1976","declared pursuant to Section 7(d) hereof, shall have the right"
"1977","to receive such unpaid dividends and distributions with respect"
"1978","to the shares of MidCap Fund that such person had on such"
"1979","Distribution Record Date."
"1980","(e) All books and records relating to MidCap Fund, including all"
"1981","books and records required to be maintained under the Investment"
"1982","Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act), and the rules and regulations"
"1983","thereunder, shall be available to Small Cap Fund from and after"

"1988","Shares and the value of MidCap Fund's Net Assets to be acquired"
"1989","by Small Cap Fund hereunder shall in each case be computed as"
"1990","of 1:00 p.m., Pacific time, on the Closing Date, unless on such"
"1991","date: (i) the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is not open for"
"1992","unrestricted trading; or (ii) the reporting of trading on the"
"1993","NYSE or other relevant market is disrupted; or (iii) any other"
"1994","extraordinary financial event or market condition occurs (each"
"1995","of the events described in (i), (ii) or (iii) are referred to"
"1996","as a Market Disruption).  The net asset value per share of"
"1997","Small Cap Fund Shares and MidCap Fund Shares and the value of"

"2002","be carried to the fourth decimal place."
"2003","(b) In the event of a Market Disruption on the proposed Closing"
"2004","Date so that an accurate appraisal of the net asset value of"
"2005","Small Cap Fund Shares or MidCap Fund Shares or the value of"
"2006","MidCap Fund's Net Assets is impracticable, the Closing Date"
"2007","shall be postponed until the first business day when regular"

"2017","Pacific time, on December 1, 2017 or such other date as the"

"2030","of Small Cap Fund, shall provide evidence that such Small Cap"
"2031","Fund Shares have been registered in an account on the books of"
"2032","Small Cap Fund in such manner as the officers of FVIT, on behalf"
"2033","of MidCap Fund, may reasonably request."
"2034","4.  Representations and Warranties by FVIT on behalf of"
"2035","Small Cap Fund and MidCap Fund."
"2036","FVIT, on behalf of Small Cap Fund and MidCap Fund, represents and"
"2037","warrants that:"
"2038","(a) Each Fund is a series of FVIT, which was originally organized as"
"2039","a Massachusetts business trust on September 11, 1989, and was"
"2040","reorganized as a Delaware statutory trust effective on"
"2041","November 2, 2015.  FVIT is validly existing under the laws of the"
"2042","State of Delaware.  FVIT is duly registered under the 1940 Act as"
"2043","an open-end, management investment company and each Fund's shares"
"2044","sold were sold pursuant to an effective registration statement"
"2045","filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act), except"
"2046","for those shares sold pursuant to the private offering exemption"
"2047","for the purpose of raising initial capital or obtaining any required"
"2048","initial shareholder approvals."
"2049","(b) FVIT is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares of"
"2050","beneficial interest, without par value, of each Fund, each"
"2051","outstanding share of which is, and each share of Small Cap Fund"
"2052","when issued pursuant to and in accordance with the Plan will be,"
"2053","fully paid, non-assessable, and has or will have full voting rights."
"2054","FVIT currently issues shares of five series, including the Funds."
"2055","Small Cap Fund currently is divided into five classes of shares:"
"2056","Class A, Class C, Class R, Class R6 and Advisor Class shares of"
"2057","beneficial interest, of which Class A, Class C, Class R and Advisor"
"2058","Class represent Small Cap Fund Shares.  MidCap Fund currently is"
"2059","divided into four classes of Shares: Class A, Class C, Class R and"
"2060","Advisor Class shares of beneficial interest.  No shareholder of"
"2061","either Fund shall have any option, warrant or preemptive right of"
"2062","subscription or purchase with respect to MidCap Fund Shares or"
"2063","Small Cap Fund Shares."
"2064","(c) The financial statements appearing in each Fund's Annual Report"
"2065","to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, audited"
"2066","by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and any interim unaudited financial"
"2067","statements, fairly present the financial position of each Fund as"
"2068","of their respective dates and the results of each Fund's operations"
"2069","for periods indicated, in conformity with Generally Accepted"
"2070","Accounting Principles applied on a consistent basis."
"2071","(d) The books and records of each Fund accurately summarize the"
"2072","accounting data represented and contain no material omissions with"
"2073","respect to the business and operations of such Fund."
"2074","(e) FVIT, on behalf of each Fund, is not a party to or obligated"
"2075","under any provision of its Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as"
"2076","amended, or By-laws, as amended, or any contract or any other"
"2077","commitment or obligation and is not subject to any order or"
"2078","decree that would be violated by its execution of or performance"
"2079","under the Plan, and no consent, approval, authorization or order"
"2080","of any court or governmental authority is required for the"
"2081","consummation by FVIT, on behalf of either Fund, of the transactions"
"2082","contemplated by the Plan, except for the registration of Small Cap"
"2083","Fund Shares under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or as may otherwise"
"2084","be required under the federal and state securities laws or the rules"
"2085","and regulations thereunder.  MidCap Fund has no material contracts"
"2086","or other commitments (other than the Plan or agreements for the"
"2087","purchase of securities entered into in the ordinary course of"
"2088","business and consistent with its obligations under the Plan) which"
"2089","will not be terminated by MidCap Fund in accordance with their terms"
"2090","at or prior to the Closing Date, or which will result in a penalty or"
"2091","additional fee to be due from or payable by MidCap Fund."
"2092","(f) FVIT has elected to treat each Fund as a regulated investment"
"2093","company (RIC) for federal income tax purposes under Part I of"
"2094","Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended"
"2095","(the Code).  Each Fund is a fund as defined in Section 851(g)(2)"
"2096","of the Code.  Each Fund has qualified as a RIC for each taxable year"
"2097","since its inception and that has ended prior to the Closing Date,"
"2098","and, with respect to MidCap Fund, will have satisfied the"
"2099","requirements of Part I of Subchapter M of the Code to maintain such"
"2100","qualification for the period beginning on the first day of its"
"2101","current taxable year and ending on the Closing Date, and, with"
"2102","respect to Small Cap Fund, intends to continue to qualify as a"
"2103","RIC after the Closing Date.  Neither Fund has had any earnings"
"2104","and profits accumulated in any taxable year to which the provisions"
"2105","of Subchapter M of the Code (or the corresponding provisions of prior"
"2106","law) did not apply.  Consummation of the transactions contemplated by"
"2107","the Plan will not cause either Fund to fail to be qualified as a RIC"
"2108","as of the Closing Date."
"2109","(g) Neither Fund is under jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or"
"2110","similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code."
"2111","(h) Neither Fund has any unamortized or unpaid organizational fees"
"2112","or expenses."
"2113","(i) All information to be furnished by either Fund for use in"
"2114","preparing any prospectus, proxy statement and other documents"
"2115","which may be necessary in connection with the transactions"
"2116","contemplated hereby shall be accurate and complete."
"2117","(j) Neither Fund has any known liabilities, costs or expenses of a"
"2118","material amount, contingent or otherwise, other than those reflected"
"2119","in the financial statements referred to in Section 4(c) hereof and"
"2120","those incurred in the ordinary course of business as an investment"
"2121","company and of a nature and amount similar to, and consistent with,"
"2122","those shown in such financial statements since the dates of those"
"2123","financial statements."
"2124","(k) There is no inter-corporate indebtedness existing between MidCap"
"2125","Fund and Small Cap Fund that was issued, acquired, or will be settled"
"2126","at a discount."
"2127","(l) The registration statement on Form N-14 referred to in"
"2128","Section 6(h) hereof (the Registration Statement), and any"
"2129","prospectus or statement of additional information of Small Cap"
"2130","Fund or MidCap Fund contained or incorporated therein by reference,"
"2131","and any supplement or amendment to the Registration Statement, or"
"2132","any such prospectus or statement of additional information or"
"2133","supplement thereto, on the effective and clearance dates of"
"2134","the Registration Statement, on the date of the special meeting"
"2135","of MidCap Fund's shareholders to vote on the Plan (the Special
Meeting) and on the Closing Date: (i) shall comply in all material"
"2136","respects with the provisions of the 1933 Act, the Securities Exchange"
"2137","Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act), the 1940 Act, the rules and regulations"
"2138","thereunder, and all applicable state securities laws and the rules and"
"2139","regulations thereunder; and (ii) shall not contain any untrue"
"2140","statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact"
"2141","required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements"
"2142","therein, in light of the circumstances under which the statements"
"2143","were made, not misleading."
"2144","(m) Since October 31, 2016, there has not been any material adverse"
"2145","change in either Fund's financial condition, assets, liabilities,"
"2146","or business other than changes occurring in the ordinary course"
"2147","of its business."
"2148","(n) No consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or"
"2149","governmental authority is required for the consummation by FVIT,"
"2150","on behalf of each Fund, of the transactions contemplated by the"
"2151","Plan, except as may otherwise be required under federal or state"
"2152","securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder."
"2153","(o) As of the Closing Date, MidCap Fund will not have outstanding"
"2154","any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type"
"2155","of rights pursuant to which any person could acquire shares of"
"2156","MidCap Fund, except for the right of investors to acquire its"
"2157","shares at the applicable stated offering price in the normal course"
"2158","of its business as an open-end management investment company"
"2159","operating under the 1940 Act."
"2160","(p) There is no material suit, judicial action, or legal or"
"2161","administrative proceeding pending or threatened against FVIT."
"2162","FVIT, on behalf of either Fund, is not a party to or subject to the"
"2163","provisions of any order, decree or judgment of any court or"
"2164","governmental body which materially and adversely affects Small"
"2165","Cap Fund's or MidCap Fund's business or their ability to consummate"
"2166","the transactions herein contemplated."
"2167","(q) The execution, delivery, and performance of the Plan have been"
"2168","duly authorized by all necessary action of FVIT's Board of Trustees,"
"2169","subject to approval of MidCap Fund's shareholders."
"2170","(r) On the Closing Date, all material Returns (as defined below) of"
"2171","each Fund required by law to have been filed by such date (including"
