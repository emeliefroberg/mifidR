"5118","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"5119","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of The Hartford"
"5120","Mutual Funds II, Inc."
"5121","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"5122","statements of The Hartford Mutual Funds II, Inc. (the"
"5123","Company) as of and for the year ended October 31, 2016, in"
"5124","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"5125","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"5126","the Company's internal control over financial reporting,"
"5127","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"5128","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"5129","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"5130","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"5131","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"5132","Company's internal control over financial reporting."
"5133","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"5134","The management of the Company is responsible for"
"5135","establishing and maintaining effective internal control over"
"5136","financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"5137","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"5138","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"5139","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"5140","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"5141","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"5142","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"5143","accounting principles. A company's internal control over"
"5144","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"5145","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"5146","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"5147","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"5148","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"5149","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"5150","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"5151","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"5152","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"5153","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"5154","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"5155","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's"
"5156","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"5157","statements."
"5158","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"5159","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"5160","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"5161","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"5162","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"5163","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"5164","deteriorate."
"5165","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"5166","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"5167","management or employees, in the normal course of"
"5168","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"5169","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"5170","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"5171","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"5172","possibility that a material misstatement of the company's"
"5173","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"5174","detected on a timely basis."
"5175","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over"
"5176","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the"
"5177","first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"5178","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"5179","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"5180","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"5181","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Company's internal"
"5182","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"5183","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"5184","material weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2016."
"5185","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"5186","management and the Board of Directors of The Hartford"
"5187","Mutual Funds II, Inc. and the Securities and Exchange"
"5188","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used"
"5189","by anyone other than these specified parties."

"5209","District of New Jersey, alleging that HIFSCO received"
"5210","excessive advisory and distribution fees in violation of its"
"5211","statutory fiduciary duty under Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act"
"5212","when serving as investment manager and principal"
"5213","underwriter, respectively, to the Hartford retail mutual funds."
"5214","Although this action was purportedly filed on behalf of certain"
"5215","of the Hartford Funds, none of the Hartford Funds is itself a"
"5216","defendant to the suit. HIFSCO moved to dismiss and, in"
"5217","September 2011, the motion was granted in part and denied in"
"5218","part, with leave to amend the complaint. In November 2011,"
"5219","plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on behalf of certain"
"5220","Hartford retail mutual funds, The Hartford Global Health Fund"
"5221","(now known as The Hartford Healthcare Fund), The Hartford"
"5222","Conservative Allocation Fund, The Hartford Growth"
"5223","Opportunities Fund, The Hartford Inflation Plus Fund, The"
"5224","Hartford Advisers Fund (now known as The Hartford"
"5225","Balanced Fund), and The Hartford Capital Appreciation Fund."
"5226","Plaintiffs seek to rescind the investment management"
"5227","agreements and distribution plans between HIFSCO and these"
"5228","funds and to recover the total fees charged thereunder or, in"
"5229","the alternative, to recover any improper compensation"
"5230","HIFSCO received, in addition to lost earnings. HIFSCO filed a"
"5231","partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint and, in"
"5232","December 2012, the court dismissed without prejudice the"
"5233","claims regarding distribution fees and denied the motion with"
"5234","respect to the advisory fees claims. In March 2014, the"
"5235","plaintiffs filed a new complaint that added as new plaintiffs"
"5236","The Hartford Floating Rate Fund and The Hartford Small"
"5237","Company Fund and named as a defendant HFMC, which"
"5238","assumed the role as investment manager to the funds as of"
"5239","January 2013. In June 2015, HFMC and HIFSCO moved for"
"5240","summary judgment, and plaintiffs cross-moved for partial"
"5241","summary judgment with respect to The Hartford Capital"
"5242","Appreciation Fund. In March 2016, the court, in large part,"
"5243","denied summary judgment for all parties. The court granted"
"5244","judgment for HFMC and HIFSCO with respect to all claims"
"5245","made by The Hartford Small Company Fund and certain"
"5246","claims made by The Hartford Floating Rate Fund. The court"
"5247","further ruled that the appropriate measure of damages on the"
"5248","surviving claims is the difference, if any, between the actual"
"5249","advisory fees paid through trial and those that could have been"
"5250","paid under the applicable legal standard. HFMC and HIFSCO"
"5251","dispute the allegations and intend to defend vigorously. As of"
"5252","October 31, 2016, the trial was scheduled for November 2016."
