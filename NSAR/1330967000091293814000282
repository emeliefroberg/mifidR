"3677","             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3678","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"3679","MFS Series Trust XII"
"3680","  In  planning  and  performing  our  audits  of the financial statements of MFS"
"3681","Lifetime Retirement Income Fund, MFS Lifetime 2010 Fund, MFS Lifetime 2015 Fund,"
"3682","MFS Lifetime 2020 Fund, MFS Lifetime 2025 Fund,  MFS  Lifetime  2030  Fund,  MFS"
"3683","Lifetime  2035  Fund,  MFS  Lifetime  2040  Fund,  MFS  Lifetime 2045 Fund,  MFS"
"3684","Lifetime  2050  Fund and MFS Lifetime 2055 Fund  (the Funds)  (eleven  of  the"
"3685","portfolios comprising MFS Series Trust XII) as of and for the period ended April"
"3686","30, 2014, in accordance  with  the  standards  of  the Public Company Accounting"
"3687","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'  internal control over"
"3688","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"3689","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing  our opinion"
"3690","on  the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form  N-SAR,"
"3691","but not  for  the  purpose  of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"3692","Funds' internal control over  financial  reporting.  Accordingly,  we express no"
"3693","such opinion."
"3694","The  management  of  the  Funds  is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3695","effective  internal  control  over  financial   reporting.  In  fulfilling  this"
"3696","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"3697","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A  company's  internal control"
"3698","over  financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance"
"3699","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"3700","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"3701","accounting  principles.  A  company's  internal control over financial reporting"
"3702","includes those policies and procedures that  (1)  pertain  to the maintenance of"
"3703","records   that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect   the"
"3704","transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2) provide"
"3705","reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as necessary to permit"
"3706","preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with generally  accepted"
"3707","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of  the  company  are"
"3708","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"3709","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"3710","detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"3711","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3712","Because of its  inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3713","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"3714","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3715","inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or  that  the degree of compliance"
"3716","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3717","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"3718","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,  in the normal"
"3719","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"3720","misstatements on a timely basis. A material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a"
"3721","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"3722","that there is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  a  material misstatement of the"
"3723","company's  annual  or  interim financial statements will  not  be  prevented  or"
"3724","detected on a timely basis."
"3725","Our consideration of the  Funds'  internal  control over financial reporting was"
"3726","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"3727","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"3728","weaknesses  under  standards  established  by  the   Public  Company  Accounting"
"3729","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"3730","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,  including controls"
"3731","over  safeguarding  securities  that  we consider to be a material  weakness  as"
"3732","defined above as of April 30, 2014."
"3733","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"3734","Board  of  Trustees of MFS Series Trust XII  and  the  Securities  and  Exchange"
"3735","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"3736","these specified parties."

"3842","        SECTION 1. MEETINGS. Meetings of the  Shareholders  may be called at any"
"3843","time by a majority of the Trustees. Meetings of the Shareholders for the purpose"
"3844","of considering the removal of a person serving as Trustee shall be called by the"
"3845","Trustees  if they are requested in writing to do so by Shareholders  holding  in"
"3846","the aggregate  Shares representing not less than ten percent (10%) of the voting"
"3847","power of the outstanding  Shares  of  the  Trust  having voting rights. Any such"
"3848","meeting  shall be held within or without The Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts  on"
"3849","such day and at such time as the Trustees shall designate."
"3850","        SECTION  2.  NOTICE OF MEETINGS. Notice of all meetings of Shareholders,"
"3851","stating the time, place  and  purposes  of  the  meeting,  shall be given by the"
"3852","Trustees in accordance with the Declaration, mailed or sent  at  least  (ten) 10"
"3853","days  and  not  more than ninety (90) days before the meeting. Only the business"
"3854","stated in the notice  of  the  meeting  shall be considered at such meeting. Any"
"3855","adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned  without  further notice, even if the"
"3856","date  of such adjourned meeting is more than 90 days after  the  notice  of  the"
"3857","meeting  was  mailed  or  sent.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if either the"
"3858","President  or  Clerk  of the Trust, or in the absence or unavailability  of  the"
"3859","President and the Clerk,  any  officer of the Trust, determines that as a result"
"3860","of force majeure or an act of God or war, the date, time or place designated for"
"3861","a meeting or adjourned meeting of  Shareholders is not reasonably practicable or"
"3862","available, such officer may, without  further  notice to Shareholders, designate"
"3863","such other date, time or place for such meeting  or  adjourned  meeting  as such"
"3864","officer shall, in his or her sole discretion, determine. No notice need be given"
"3865","to  any  Shareholder  who  shall  have failed to inform the Trust of his current"
"3866","address or if a written waiver of notice,  executed  before or after the meeting"
"3867","by  the  Shareholder or his attorney thereunto authorized,  is  filed  with  the"
"3868","records of the meeting."
"3869","      SECTION  3.  RECORD  DATE FOR MEETINGS. For the purpose of determining the"
"3870","Shareholders who are entitled  to  notice  of  and to vote at any meeting, or to"
"3871","participate in any distribution, or for the purpose  of  any  other  action, the"
"3872","Trustees  may  from  time to time close the transfer books for such period,  not"
"3873","exceeding thirty (30)  days,  as  the Trustees may determine; or without closing"
"3874","the transfer books the Trustees may  fix  a  date not more than ninety (90) days"
"3875","prior to the date of any meeting of Shareholders or distribution or other action"
"3876","as  a  record  date  for  the determination of the  persons  to  be  treated  as"
"3877","Shareholders of record for  such  purpose. The Trustees also may select the time"
"3878","of  day  as  of which the calculations  for  determining  how  many  votes  each"
"3879","Shareholder is entitled to pursuant to the Declaration shall be performed."
"3880","      SECTION  4.  PROXIES. At any meeting of Shareholders, any holder of Shares"
"3881","entitled to vote thereat  may  vote  by  proxy,  provided that no proxy shall be"
"3882","voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Clerk, or"
"3883","with  such  other officer or agent of the Trust as the  Clerk  may  direct,  for"
"3884","verification  prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a"
"3885","vote of a majority  of the Trustees, proxies may be solicited in the name of one"
"3886","or more Trustees or one  or more of the officers of the Trust. When any Share is"
"3887","held jointly by several persons,  any  one  of  them  may vote at any meeting in"
"3888","person  or  by proxy in respect of such Share (and a proxy  shall  be  valid  if"
"3889","executed by any  one  of them), but if more than one of them shall be present at"
"3890","such meeting in person  or  by  proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so"
"3891","present disagree as to any vote to  be  cast, such vote shall not be received in"
"3892","respect of such Share. A proxy purporting  to  be  executed by or on behalf of a"
"3893","Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise,"
"3894","and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the  challenger.  The placing"
"3895","of  a  Shareholder's  name  on  a proxy pursuant to telephonic or electronically"
"3896","transmitted instructions obtained  pursuant to procedures reasonably designed to"
"3897","verify that such instructions have been  authorized  by  such  Shareholder shall"
"3898","constitute execution of such proxy by or on behalf of such Shareholder.  If  the"
"3899","holder  of any such Share is a minor or a person of unsound mind, and subject to"
"3900","guardianship  or  to the legal control of any other person as regards the charge"
"3901","or management of such  Share,  he  may vote by his guardian or such other person"
"3902","appointed or having such control, and  such  vote  may  be given in person or by"
"3903","proxy. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of a"
"3904","proxy may be substituted for or used in lieu of the original  proxy  for any and"
"3905","all  purposes  for  which  the original proxy could be used, provided that  such"
"3906","copy, facsimile telecommunication  or  other  reproduction  shall  be a complete"
"3907","reproduction of the entire original proxy or the portion thereof to  be returned"
"3908","by the Shareholder."
"3909","      SECTION  5.  QUORUM  AND  ADJOURNMENT.   Except  when  a larger quorum  is"
"3910","required by any provision of law, Shares representing a majority  of  the voting"
"3911","power  of  the outstanding Shares entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum  at"
"3912","any meeting  of  Shareholders,  except  that  where  any  provision  of law, the"
"3913","Declaration or these By-laws requires that holders of any series or class  shall"
"3914","vote  as a series or class, then Shares representing a majority (unless a larger"
"3915","quorum  is  required  as  specified  above) of the voting power of the aggregate"
"3916","number of Shares of that series or class  entitled to vote shall be necessary to"
"3917","constitute a quorum for the transaction of  business by that series or class. In"
"3918","the absence of a quorum, Shareholders entitled  to  cast  votes  representing  a"
"3919","majority  of the voting power of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote present"
"3920","in person or  by proxy, or, where any provision of law, the Declaration or these"
"3921","By-laws requires  that  holders of any series or class shall vote as a series or"
"3922","class, Shareholders entitled to cast votes representing a majority of the voting"
"3923","power of the outstanding Shares of that series or class entitled to vote present"
"3924","in person or by proxy, may  adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum"
"3925","shall be present. Only Shareholders  of  record shall be entitled to vote on any"
"3926","matter."
"3927","      SECTION 6. INSPECTION OF RECORDS. The  records  of the Trust shall be open"
"3928","to inspection by Shareholders to the same extent as is permitted shareholders of"
"3929","a Massachusetts business corporation."
"3930","      SECTION  7.  ACTION  WITHOUT MEETING. Any action which  may  be  taken  by"
"3931","Shareholders may be taken without  a  meeting  if  Shareholders  holding  Shares"
"3932","representing  a  majority of the voting power of the Shares entitled to vote  on"
"3933","the matter (or such  larger  proportion thereof as shall be required by law, the"
"3934","Declaration or these By-Laws for  approval of such matter) consent to the action"
"3935","in writing and the written consents  are  filed with the records of the meetings"
"3936","of Shareholders. Such consent shall be treated  for all purposes as a vote taken"
"3937","at a meeting of Shareholders."

"3939","                                    TRUSTEES"
"3940","      SECTION 1. MEETINGS OF THE TRUSTEES. The Trustees  may in their discretion"
"3941","provide  for regular or stated meetings of the Trustees. Notice  of  regular  or"
"3942","stated meetings  need  not be given. Meetings of the Trustees other than regular"
"3943","or stated meetings shall be held whenever called by the Chair of the Trustees or"
"3944","by any one of the Trustees  at  the time being in office. Notice of the time and"
"3945","place of each meeting other than  regular  or  stated meetings shall be given by"
"3946","the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the  Clerk  or an Assistant Clerk or"
"3947","by the officer, Chair of the Trustees or other Trustee calling  the  meeting and"
"3948","shall be mailed to each Trustee at least two days before the meeting,  or  shall"
"3949","be  telegraphed,  cabled, or wirelessed or sent by facsimile or other electronic"
"3950","means to each Trustee  at his usual or last known business or residence address,"
"3951","or personally delivered  to him at least one day before the meeting. Such notice"
"3952","may, however, be waived by any Trustee. Notice of a meeting need not be given to"
"3953","any Trustee if a written waiver  of  notice, executed by him before or after the"
"3954","meeting, is filed with the records of the meeting, or to any Trustee who attends"
"3955","the meeting without protesting prior thereto  or at its commencement the lack of"
"3956","notice to him. A notice or waiver of notice need  not specify the purpose of any"
"3957","meeting. Except as provided by law the Trustees may meet by means of a telephone"
"3958","conference circuit or similar communications equipment  by  means  of  which all"
"3959","persons  participating  in  the  meeting  can  hear  each other, which telephone"
"3960","conference meeting shall be deemed to have been held at  a  place  designated by"
"3961","the  Trustees  at  the meeting. Participation in a telephone conference  meeting"
"3962","shall constitute presence in person at such meeting."
"3963","      SECTION 2. QUORUM  AND  MANNER OF ACTING. A majority of the Trustees shall"
"3964","be  present at any regular or special  meeting  of  the  Trustees  in  order  to"
"3965","constitute  a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting and (except"
"3966","as otherwise  required  by  law,  the Declaration or these By-Laws) the act of a"
"3967","majority of the Trustees present at  any  such  meeting,  at  which  a quorum is"
"3968","present,  shall  be  the  act  of  the  Trustees. In the absence of a quorum,  a"
"3969","majority of the Trustees present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until"
"3970","a quorum shall be present. Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given."

"3983","Committees from time to time,  the  number composing such Committees, the powers"
"3984","conferred upon the same (subject to the  same limitations as with respect to the"
"3985","Executive  Committee)  and  the term of membership  on  such  Committees  to  be"

"3987","Committee.  In  the  absence  of such designation a Committee may elect its  own"
"3988","Chair."
"3989","      SECTION 2. MEETING, QUORUM AND MANNER OF ACTING. The Trustees may:"
"3990","            (i)   provide for stated meetings of any Committee;"

"4378","February, 2014, by MFS Series Trust XII, a Massachusetts business trust with its"
"4379","principal place of business at 111 Huntington Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts"
"4380","02199 (the Trust), on behalf of MFS Lifetime 2010 Fund (the Acquired Fund)"
"4381","and MFS Lifetime Retirement Income Fund (the Surviving Fund), each a"
"4382","segregated portfolio of assets (series) thereof. Each of the Acquired Fund and"
"4383","the Surviving Fund are also referred to herein as a Fund and, together, as the"
"4384","Funds."
"4385","This Plan is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization within"
"4386","the meaning of the regulations under Section 368(a) (the Regulations) of the"
"4387","United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). The"
"4388","reorganization will consist of (1) the transfer of the Assets (as defined"
"4389","herein) of the Acquired Fund to the Surviving Fund in exchange solely for the"
"4390","assumption by the Surviving Fund of the Liabilities (as defined herein) of the"
"4391","Acquired Fund and the issuance to the Acquired Fund of shares of beneficial"
"4392","interest, no par value (shares), in the Surviving Fund (the Reorganization
Shares), (2) the distribution of the Reorganization Shares to the shareholders"
"4393","of the Acquired Fund in liquidation of the Acquired Fund as provided herein and"
"4394","(3) the termination of the Acquired Fund, all upon the terms and conditions"
"4395","hereinafter set forth in this Plan (collectively, the Reorganization)."
"4396","All representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the Surviving Fund"
"4397","and the Acquired Fund contained herein shall be deemed to be representations,"
"4398","warranties, covenants and obligations of the Trust, acting on behalf of the"

"4400","created hereunder in favor of the Surviving Fund and the Acquired Fund shall"
"4401","inure to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trust, acting on behalf of the"
"4402","Acquired Fund and the Surviving Fund, respectively."
"4403","The Acquired Fund's shares are divided into eight classes, designated Class A,"
"4404","Class B, Class C, Class I, Class R1, Class R2, Class R3, and Class R4 shares"
"4405","(the Class A Acquired Fund Shares, the Class B Acquired Fund Shares, the"

R1 Acquired Fund Shares, the Class R2 Acquired Fund Shares, the Class R3
Acquired Fund Shares, and the Class R4 Acquired Fund Shares, respectively,"
"4407","and together, the Acquired Fund Shares). The Surviving Fund's shares are"
"4408","divided into eight classes (the Surviving Fund Shares), designated Class A,"
"4409","Class B, Class C, Class I, Class R1, Class R2, Class R3, and Class R4 shares"

Reorganization Shares,  and the Class R4 Reorganization Shares,"
"4412","respectively), which are all involved in the Reorganization and thus included in"
"4413","the term Reorganization Shares. Each class of Acquired Fund Shares is"
"4414","substantially similar to the corresponding class of Reorganization Shares, i.e.,"
"4415","the Acquired Fund's Class A, Class B, Class C, Class I, Class R1, Class R2,"
"4416","Class R3, and Class R4 shares correspond to the Surviving Fund's Class A, Class"
"4417","B, Class C, Class I, Class R1, Class R2, Class R3, and Class R4 shares,"
"4418","respectively."
"4419","In consideration of the premises of the covenants and agreements hereinafter set"
"4420","forth, the parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:"
"4421","1.  THE REORGANIZATION"
"4422","1.1 The Acquired Fund will transfer to the Surviving Fund all of its assets"
"4423","(consisting of, without limitation, portfolio securities and instruments,"
"4424","dividend and interest receivables, claims and rights of action, cash and other"
"4425","assets) as set forth in a statement of assets and liabilities as of the"
"4426","Valuation Time (as defined in paragraph 2.1 hereof) prepared in accordance with"
"4427","generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, certified by the"
"4428","Acquired Fund's Treasurer, Deputy Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer and delivered"
"4429","by the Acquired Fund to the Surviving Fund pursuant to paragraph 5.5 hereof (the"
"4430","Statement of Assets and Liabilities) (collectively, the Assets), free and"
"4431","clear of all liens and encumbrances, except as otherwise provided herein, in"
"4432","exchange solely for (a) the assumption by the Surviving Fund of all of the"
"4433","liabilities of the Acquired Fund as set forth in the Statement of Assets and"
"4434","Liabilities (collectively, the Liabilities) and (b) the issuance and delivery"
"4435","by the Surviving Fund to the Acquired Fund, for distribution in accordance with"
"4436","paragraph 1.3 hereof pro rata to the Acquired Fund shareholders of record"
"4437","determined as of the Valuation Time (the Acquired Fund Shareholders), of the"
"4438","number of full and fractional (rounded to the third decimal place)"
"4439","Reorganization Shares determined as provided in paragraph 2.2 hereof. Such"
"4440","transactions shall take place at the closing provided for in paragraph 3.1"
"4441","hereof (the Closing)."
"4442","1.2 The Acquired Fund has provided the Surviving Fund with a list of the current"
"4443","securities holdings and other assets of the Acquired Fund as of the date of"
"4444","execution of this Plan. The Acquired Fund reserves the right to sell any of"
"4445","these securities or other assets prior to the Closing in the ordinary course of"
"4446","business."
"4447","1.3 On or as soon after the closing date established in paragraph 3.1 hereof"
"4448","(the Closing Date) as is conveniently practicable (the Liquidation Date),"
"4449","the Acquired Fund will distribute the Reorganization Shares it received pursuant"
"4450","to paragraph 1.1 hereof pro rata to the Acquired Fund Shareholders in actual or"
"4451","constructive exchange for their Acquired Fund Shares in complete liquidation of"
"4452","the Acquired Fund. Such distribution will be accomplished by the transfer of the"
"4453","Class A, Class B, Class C, Class I, Class R1, Class R2, Class R3, and Class R4"
"4454","Reorganization Shares then credited to the account of the Acquired Fund on the"
"4455","books of the Surviving Fund to open accounts on the share records of the"
"4456","Surviving Fund in the names of the Acquired Fund Shareholders and representing"
"4457","the respective pro rata number of full and fractional (rounded to the third"
"4458","decimal place) Class A, Class B, Class C, Class I, Class R1, Class R2, Class R3,"
"4459","and Class R4 Reorganization Shares due such shareholders, by class (i.e., the"
"4460","account for each Acquired Fund Shareholder of Class A, Class B, Class C, Class"
"4461","I, Class R1, Class R2, Class R3, and Class R4 Acquired Fund Shares shall be"
"4462","credited with the respective pro rata number of Class A, Class B, Class C, Class"
"4463","I, Class R1, Class R2, Class R3, and Class R4 (as applicable) Reorganization"
"4464","Shares due that shareholder). The Surviving Fund will not issue share"
"4465","certificates representing the Reorganization Shares in connection with such"
"4466","distribution, except in connection with pledges and assignments and in certain"
"4467","other limited circumstances."
"4468","1.4 The Acquired Fund shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that Acquired Fund"
"4469","Shareholders holding certificates representing their ownership of Acquired Fund"
"4470","Shares surrender such certificates or deliver an affidavit with respect to lost"
"4471","certificates, in such form and accompanied by such surety bonds as the Acquired"
"4472","Fund may require (collectively, an Affidavit), to the Acquired Fund prior to"
"4473","the Closing Date. Any Acquired Fund Share certificate that remains outstanding"
"4474","on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be cancelled, shall no longer show"
"4475","evidence of ownership of Acquired Fund Shares and shall not evidence ownership"
"4476","of any Reorganization Shares. Unless and until any such certificate shall be so"
"4477","surrendered or an Affidavit relating thereto shall be delivered, any dividends"
"4478","and other distributions payable by the Surviving Fund subsequent to the Closing"
"4479","Date with respect to the Reorganization Shares allocable to a holder of such"
"4480","certificate(s) shall be paid to such holder, but such holder may not redeem or"
"4481","transfer such Reorganization Shares."
"4482","1.5 Any transfer taxes payable upon issuance of the Reorganization Shares in a"
"4483","name other than the registered holder of the Acquired Fund Shares on the books"
"4484","of the Acquired Fund as of that time shall, as a condition of such issuance and"
"4485","transfer, be paid by the person to whom such Reorganization Shares are to be"
"4486","issued and transferred."
"4487","1.6 The legal existence of the Acquired Fund shall be terminated promptly"
"4488","following the Liquidation Date."
"4489","2.  VALUATION"
"4490","2.1 The net asset value of each class of the Reorganization Shares and the net"
"4491","value of the Assets shall in each case be determined as of the close of business"
"4492","(4:00 p.m. Boston time) on the Closing Date (the Valuation Time). The net"
"4493","asset value of each class of the Reorganization Shares shall be computed by"
"4494","State Street Bank and Trust Company (the Custodian), as custodian and pricing"
"4495","agent for the Surviving Fund, using the valuation procedures set forth in the"
"4496","Trust's Declaration of Trust (the Declaration of Trust) or Master Amended and"
"4497","Restated By-Laws (the By-Laws) and the Surviving Fund's then-current"
"4498","prospectus and statement of additional information (collectively, the Surviving
Fund Valuation Procedures), to not less than two decimal places. The net value"
"4499","of the Assets shall be computed by the Custodian, as custodian and pricing agent"
"4500","for the Acquired Fund, by calculating the value of the Assets and subtracting"
"4501","therefrom the amount of the Liabilities, using the valuation procedures set"
"4502","forth in the Declaration of Trust or By-Laws and the Acquired Fund's then-"
"4503","current prospectus and statement of additional information (collectively, the"
"4504","Acquired Fund Valuation Procedures). The determinations of the Custodian shall"
"4505","be conclusive and binding on all parties in interest; provided, however, that,"
"4506","in computing each Fund's net asset value in accordance with this paragraph 2.1,"
"4507","any fair value determination required to be made by the Surviving Fund Valuation"
"4508","Procedures or Acquired Fund Valuation Procedures with respect to a portfolio"
"4509","security or other asset of either Fund shall be made in accordance with the"
"4510","applicable Fund's Valuation Procedures, and any such fair value determinations"
"4511","shall be conclusive and binding on the Custodian and all parties in interest."
"4512","2.2 The number of each class of Reorganization Shares (including fractional"
"4513","shares, if any, rounded to the third decimal place) the Surviving Fund shall"
"4514","issue pursuant to paragraph 1.1(b) hereof shall be as follows: (a) the number of"
"4515","Class A Reorganization Shares shall be determined by dividing the net value of"
"4516","the Assets (computed as set forth in paragraph 2.1 hereof) (the Acquired Fund
Value) attributable to the Class A Acquired Fund Shares by the net asset value"
"4517","of a Class A Reorganization Share (computed as set forth in such paragraph); (b)"
"4518","the number of Class B Reorganization Shares shall be determined by dividing the"
"4519","Acquired Fund Value attributable to the Class B Acquired Fund Shares by the net"
"4520","asset value of a Class B Reorganization Share (as so computed); (c) the number"
"4521","of Class C Reorganization Shares shall be determined by dividing the Acquired"
"4522","Fund Value attributable to the Class C Acquired Fund Shares by the net asset"
"4523","value of a Class C Reorganization Share (as so computed); (d) the number of"
"4524","Class I Reorganization Shares shall be determined by dividing the Acquired Fund"
"4525","Value attributable to the Class I Acquired Fund Shares by the net asset value of"
"4526","a Class I Reorganization Share (as so computed); (e) the number of Class R1"
"4527","Reorganization Shares shall be determined by dividing the Acquired Fund Value"
"4528","attributable to the Class R1 Acquired Fund Shares by the net asset value of a"
"4529","Class R1 Reorganization Share (as so computed); (f) the number of Class R2"
"4530","Reorganization Shares shall be determined by dividing the Acquired Fund Value"
"4531","attributable to the Class R2 Acquired Fund Shares by the net asset value of a"
"4532","Class R2 Reorganization Share (as so computed); (g) the number of Class R3"
"4533","Reorganization Shares shall be determined by dividing the Acquired Fund Value"
"4534","attributable to the Class R3 Acquired Fund Shares by the net asset value of a"
"4535","Class R3 Reorganization Share (as so computed); and (h) the number of Class R4"
"4536","Reorganization Shares shall be determined by dividing the Acquired Fund Value"
"4537","attributable to the Class R4 Acquired Fund Shares by the net asset value of a"
"4538","Class R4 Reorganization Share (as so computed)."
"4539","2.3 Except for certain fair value determinations as described in paragraph 2.1"
"4540","hereof, all computations of value shall be made by the Custodian in its capacity"
"4541","as pricing agent for the Surviving Fund and the Acquired Fund, as applicable,"
"4542","and in accordance with its regular practice in pricing the shares and assets of"
"4543","the Surviving Fund and the Acquired Fund, as applicable, using the relevant"

"4666","for the remainder of its current taxable year beginning May 1, 2013 and ending"

"5082","8.6 The Trust, on behalf of both the Acquired Fund and the Surviving Fund, shall"
"5083","have received an opinion of Ropes & Gray LLP (Tax Counsel), reasonably"
"5084","satisfactory to them, as to the federal income tax consequences mentioned below"
"5085","(the Tax Opinion). In rendering the Tax Opinion, Tax Counsel may rely as to"
"5086","factual matters, exclusively and without independent verification, on the"
"5087","representations and warranties made in this Plan, which Tax Counsel may treat as"
"5088","representations and warranties made to it, and in separate letters addressed to"
"5089","Tax Counsel and certificates delivered pursuant to this Plan. The Tax Opinion"
"5090","shall be substantially to the effect that, although not free from doubt, based"
"5091","on the existing provisions of the Code, Treasury regulations, current"
"5092","administrative rules, and court decisions, on the basis of the facts and"
"5093","assumptions stated therein and conditioned on consummation of the Reorganization"
"5094","in accordance with this Plan, for federal income tax purposes:"
"5095","(a) the Reorganization will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of"
"5096","Section 368(a) of the Code, and the Surviving Fund and the Acquired Fund each"
"5097","will be a party to a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of"
"5098","the Code;"
"5099","(b) no gain or loss will be recognized by the Surviving Fund upon the receipt of"
"5100","the Assets of the Acquired Fund in exchange for Reorganization Shares and the"

"5102","(c) the basis in the hands of the Surviving Fund of the Assets of the Acquired"
"5103","Fund transferred to the Surviving Fund in the Transaction will be the same as"
"5104","the basis of such Assets in the hands of the Acquired Fund immediately prior to"
"5105","the transfer;"
"5106","(d) the holding periods of the Assets of the Acquired Fund in the hands of the"
"5107","Surviving Fund will include the periods during which such Assets were held by"
"5108","the Acquired Fund;"
"5109","(e) no gain or loss will be recognized by the Acquired Fund upon the transfer of"
"5110","the Acquired Fund's Assets to the Surviving Fund in exchange for the"
"5111","Reorganization Shares and the assumption by the Surviving Fund of the"
"5112","Liabilities of the Acquired Fund, or upon the distribution of the Reorganization"
"5113","Shares by the Acquired Fund to its shareholders in liquidation pursuant to this"
"5114","Plan;"
"5115","(f) no gain or loss will be recognized by the Acquired Fund Shareholders upon"
"5116","the exchange of their Acquired Fund shares for Reorganization Shares;"
"5117","(g) the aggregate basis of the Reorganization Shares that an Acquired Fund"
"5118","Shareholder receives in connection with the Reorganization will be the same as"
"5119","the aggregate basis of his or her Acquired Fund shares exchanged therefore;"
"5120","(h) an Acquired Fund Shareholder's holding period for his or her Reorganization"
"5121","Shares will be determined by including the period for which he or she held the"
"5122","Acquired Fund shares exchanged therefore, provided that he or she held such"
"5123","Acquired Fund shares as capital assets; and"
"5124","(i) the Surviving Fund will succeed to and take into account the items of the"
"5125","Acquired Fund described in Section 381(c) of the Code, subject to the conditions"
"5126","and limitations specified in Sections 381, 382, 383 and 384 of the Code and the"
"5127","regulations thereunder."
"5128","Notwithstanding the above, the Tax Opinion will state that no opinion is"
"5129","expressed as to the effect of the Reorganization on the Funds or any Acquired"
"5130","Fund Shareholder with respect to any Asset as to which any unrealized gain or"
"5131","loss is required to be recognized for federal income tax purposes at the end of"
"5132","a taxable year (or on the termination or transfer thereof) under federal income"
"5133","tax principles. The Trust agrees to make and provide additional representations"
"5134","to Tax Counsel with respect to the Surviving Fund and the Acquired Fund that are"
"5135","reasonably necessary to enable Tax Counsel to deliver the Tax Opinion."
"5136","Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Trust may not waive in any"
"5137","material respect the condition set forth in this paragraph 8.6."
"5138","8.7 The Board of Trustees of each Fund shall have determined, with respect to"
"5139","each Fund, that the Reorganization is in the best interests of the Fund and is"
"5140","not dilutive of the interests of the Fund's existing shareholders and, based on"
"5141","such determinations, shall have approved this Plan and the transactions"
"5142","contemplated thereby."

"5153","be subject to any initial sales charge; however, if any Acquired Fund Shares are"

"5156","forth in the Surviving Fund Prospectus will apply to the Reorganization Shares"
"5157","issued in respect of such Acquired Fund Shares, and the Reorganization Shares"
"5158","received by Acquired Fund Shareholders pursuant to paragraph 1.4 hereof will,"

"5174","Closing Date (all on microfilm or microfiche, if available); (b) detailed"
"5175","records indicating the status of all certificates representing ownership of the"
"5176","Acquired Fund Shares issued since inception of the Acquired Fund (e.g.,"
"5177","indicating whether the certificates are outstanding or cancelled); and, if"
"5178","applicable, (c) for each Acquired Fund Shareholder, a record indicating the"
"5179","dollar amount of such shareholder's Acquired Fund Share holdings as of such date"
"5180","representing that portion of such holdings subject to a CDSC as of such date and"
