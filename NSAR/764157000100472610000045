"507","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"508","Sound Shore Fund, Inc.:"
"509","We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and"
"510","liabilities of Sound Shore Fund, Inc. (the Fund), including"
"511","the schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2009, and the"
"512","related statement of operations for the year then ended, the"
"513","statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in"
"514","the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the"
"515","five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and"
"516","financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management."
"517","Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial"
"518","statements and financial highlights based on our audits."
"519","We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of"
"520","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"521","States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the"
"522","audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial"
"523","statements and financial highlights are free of material"
"524","misstatement. The Fund is not required to have, nor were we"
"525","engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial"
"526","reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control"
"527","over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures"
"528","that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose"
"529","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"530","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"531","express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on"
"532","a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in"
"533","the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used"
"534","and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating"
"535","the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included"
"536","confirmation of the securities owned as of December 31, 2009, by"
"537","correspondence with the custodian and brokers; where replies were"
"538","not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures."
"539","We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion."
"540","In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights"
"541","referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the"
"542","financial position of Sound Shore Fund, Inc. as of December 31,"
"543","2009, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the"
"544","changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then"
"545","ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the"
"546","period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally"
"547","accepted in the United States of America."
