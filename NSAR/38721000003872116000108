"2896","<TEXT>"
"2897","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2898","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Franklin Custodian Funds"
"2899","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"2900","Franklin U.S. Government Securities Fund, Franklin Growth Fund,"
"2901","Franklin Utilities Fund, Franklin DynaTech Fund, Franklin Income Fund,"
"2902","and Franklin Focused Growth Fund (the Funds) as of and for the year"
"2903","ended September 30, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"2904","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"2905","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"2906","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"2907","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"2908","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2909","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control"
"2910","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"2911","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"2912","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2913","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"2914","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"2915","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal"
"2916","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"2917","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"2918","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"2919","with generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control"
"2920","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"2921","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"2922","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"2923","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"2924","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"2925","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"2926","of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"2927","management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"2928","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"2929","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"2930","financial statements."
"2931","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2932","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"2933","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"2934","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"2935","that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2936","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2937","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"2938","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"2939","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"2940","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"2941","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"2942","misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements will"
"2943","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2944","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"2945","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"2946","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"2947","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"2948","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we"
"2949","noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2950","reporting and their operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"2951","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"2952","above as of September 30, 2016."

"3127","Fund Shares of the same class into which the Target Fund Shares"

"3131","represented Target Fund Shares shall be deemed for all Acquiring"
"3132","Fund purposes to evidence ownership of the number of Acquiring Fund"

"3147","Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act), and the rules and regulations"
"3148","thereunder, shall be available to the Acquiring Fund from and after"
"3149","the date of the Plan, and shall be turned over to the Acquiring"

"3152","(a)	The net asset value per share of the Acquiring Fund Shares"
"3153","and the Target Fund Shares and the value of the Target Fund's Net"
"3154","Assets to be acquired by the Acquiring Fund hereunder shall in each"
"3155","case be computed as of 1:00 p.m., Pacific time, on the Closing Date,"
"3156","unless on such date: (i) the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is not"

"3159","extraordinary financial event or market condition occurs (each of"

"3162","share of the Acquiring Fund Shares and the Target Fund Shares and"
"3163","the value of the Target Fund's Net Assets shall be computed in"
"3164","accordance with the valuation procedures set forth in the most"
"3165","recent respective prospectus of the Acquiring Fund and the Target"
"3166","Fund, as amended or supplemented."
"3167","(b)	In the event of a Market Disruption on the proposed Closing Date"
"3168","so that an accurate appraisal of the net asset value per share"
"3169","of the Acquiring Fund Shares or Target Fund Shares or the value"
"3170","of the Target Fund's Net Assets is impracticable, the Closing"
"3171","Date shall be postponed until the first business day when regular"
"3172","trading on the NYSE shall have been fully resumed and reporting"
"3173","shall have been restored and other trading markets are otherwise"
"3174","stabilized."
"3175","(c)	All computations of value regarding the net asset value"

"3181","FCF at 1:00 p.m., Pacific time, on March 11, 2016 or such"
"3182","other date as the officers of FCF and FGT may mutually agree"

"3191","shareholder, indicating thereon which such shares are represented by"
"3192","outstanding certificates and which by book-entry accounts,"
"3193","as of 1:00 p.m., Pacific time, on the Closing Date.  FCF, on behalf"
"3194","of the Acquiring Fund, shall provide evidence that such Acquiring"
"3195","Fund Shares have been registered in an account on the books of"
"3196","Acquiring Fund in such manner as the officers of FGT may"
"3197","reasonably request."
