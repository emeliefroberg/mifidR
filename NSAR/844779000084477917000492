"795","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"796","TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF BLACKROCK TOTAL EMERGING MARKETS FUND AND BOARD OF"
"797","TRUSTEES OF BLACKROCK FUNDS/SM/:"
"798","In planning and performing our audit of the consolidated financial statements"
"799","of BlackRock Total Emerging Markets Fund and Subsidiary (the Fund) as of and
for the year ended October 31, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), we
considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including
controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing
procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion.

The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this
responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess
the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the
design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the
normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
fund's annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was
for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not
necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be
material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB. However, we noted
no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its
operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to
be a material weakness, as defined above, as of October 31, 2017.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and
the Board of Trustees of BlackRock Funds/SM/ and the Securities and Exchange
Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other
than these specified parties.
