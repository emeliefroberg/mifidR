"1032","             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1033","To the Board of Trustees of AIM Sector Funds (Invesco Sector Funds)"
"1034","and Shareholders of Invesco Van Kampen Capital Growth Fund:"
"1035","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco Van"
"1036","Kampen Capital Growth Fund (formerly known as Van Kampen Capital Growth Fund;"
"1037","one of the funds constituting AIM Sector Funds (Invesco Sector Funds), hereafter"
"1038","referred to as the Fund) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2010, in"
"1039","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1040","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1041","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1042","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1043","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"1044","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"1045","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an"
"1046","opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1047","reporting."
"1048","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1049","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1050","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"1051","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"1052","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1053","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1054","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1055","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"1056","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1057","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1058","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"

"1234","Distributors, Inc. (Invesco Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"

"1237","actions and/or investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"1238","the AIM Funds (n/k/a the Invesco Funds), including those formerly advised by"
"1239","IFG. As part of the settlements, a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of which"
"1240","is civil penalties) was created to compensate shareholders harmed by market"
"1241","timing and related activity in funds formerly advised by IFG. Additionally,"
"1242","Invesco and Invesco Distributors created a $50 million fair fund ($30 million of"
"1243","which is civil penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and"
"1244","related activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done pursuant to the"
"1245","terms of the settlement. The methodology of the fair funds distributions was"
"1246","determined by Invesco's independent distribution consultant (IDC Plan), in"
"1247","consultation with Invesco and the independent trustees of the Invesco Funds, and"
"1248","approved by the SEC on May 23, 2008."
"1249","     The IDC Plan provides for distribution to all eligible investors, for the"
"1250","periods spanning January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2003 (for the IFG Fair Fund)"

"1252","proportionate share of the applicable Fair Fund to compensate such investors for"
"1253","injury they may have suffered as a result of market timing in the affected"
"1254","funds. The IDC Plan includes a provision for any residual amounts in the Fair"
"1255","Funds to be distributed in the future to the affected funds. Further details"

"1262","Pending Regulatory Action Alleging Market Timing"
"1263","     On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor -"
"1264","Securities Commission (WVASC) issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and"
"1265","Notice of Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (Order No."
"1266","05-1318). The WVASC makes findings of fact that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"1267","entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the Invesco Funds"
"1268","and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for such Funds,"
"1269","and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"1270","violated the West Virginia securities laws. The WVASC orders Invesco and Invesco"
"1271","Distributors to cease any further violations and seeks to impose monetary"
"1272","sanctions, including restitution to affected investors, disgorgement of fees,"
"1273","reimbursement of investigatory, administrative and legal costs and an"
"1274","administrative assessment, to be determined by the Commissioner. Initial"
"1275","research indicates that these damages could be limited or capped by statute. By"
"1276","agreement with the Commissioner of Securities, Invesco's time to respond to that"
"1277","Order has been indefinitely suspended."
"1278","Private Civil Actions Alleging Market Timing"

"1321","     On March 1, 2006, the MDL Court dismissed all derivative causes of action"
"1322","in the Essenmacher lawsuit but two: (i) the excessive fee claim under Section"
"1323","36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act); and (ii) the"

"1327","the excessive fee claim under Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act (which survived only"
"1328","insofar as plaintiffs seek recovery of fees associated with the assets involved"
"1329","in market timing); and (iii) the control person liability claim under Section"
"1330","48 of the 1940 Act. On June 14, 2006, the MDL Court entered an order dismissing"
"1331","the Section 48 claim in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. Based on the MDL"
"1332","Court's March 1, 2006 and June 14, 2006 orders, all claims asserted against the"
"1333","Funds that were transferred to the MDL Court were dismissed, although certain"
"1334","Funds remain nominal defendants in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. On"
"1335","January 5, 2008, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle both"
"1336","the class action (Lepera) and the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuits, subject to"
"1337","the MDL Court approval. Individual class members have the right to object."
"1338","     On September 15, 2006, Judge Motz for the MDL Court granted the Defendants'"
"1339","motion to dismiss the ERISA (Calderon) lawsuit and dismissed such lawsuit. The"
"1340","Plaintiff appealed this decision. On June 16, 2008, the Fourth Circuit Court of"
"1341","Appeals reversed the dismissal and remanded this lawsuit back to the MDL Court"
"1342","for further proceedings. On December 15, 2008, the parties reached an agreement"
"1343","in principle to settle this lawsuit, subject to the MDL Court approval."
"1344","Individual class members have the right to object. No payments are required"

"1677","     1.1. It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Reorganization"
"1678","described herein shall be conducted separately of the others, and a party that"
"1679","is not a party to a Reorganization shall incur no obligations, duties or"
"1680","liabilities with respect to such Reorganization by reason of being a party to"
"1681","this Agreement. If any one or more Reorganizations should fail to be"
"1682","consummated, such failure shall not affect the other Reorganizations in any way."
"1683","<PAGE>"
"1684","     1.2. Provided that all conditions precedent to a Reorganization set forth"
"1685","herein have been satisfied as of the Closing Date (defined in Section 3.1), and"
"1686","based on the representations and warranties each party provides to the others,"
"1687","each Target Entity and its corresponding Acquiring Entity agree to take the"
"1688","following steps with respect to their Reorganization(s), the parties to which"
"1689","and classes of shares to be issued in connection with which are set forth in"
"1690","Exhibit A:"
"1691","          (a) The Target Fund shall transfer all of its Assets, as defined and"
"1692","     set forth in Section 1.2(b), to the Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund"
"1693","     in exchange therefor shall assume the Liabilities, as defined and set forth"
"1694","     in Section 1.2(c), and deliver to the Target Fund the number of full and"
"1695","     fractional Acquiring Fund shares determined in the manner set forth in"
"1696","     Section 2."
"1697","          (b) The assets of the Target Fund to be transferred to the Acquiring"
"1698","     Fund shall consist of all assets and property, including, without"
"1699","     limitation, all cash, securities, commodities and futures interests, claims"
"1700","     (whether absolute or contingent, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued and"
"1701","     including, without limitation, any interest in pending or future legal"
"1702","     claims in connection with past or present portfolio holdings, whether in"
"1703","     the form of class action claims, opt-out or other direct litigation claims,"
"1704","     or regulator or government-established investor recovery fund claims, and"
"1705","     any and all resulting recoveries) and dividends or interest receivable that"
"1706","     are owned by the Target Fund and any deferred or prepaid expenses shown as"
"1707","     an asset on the books of the Target Fund on the Closing Date, except for"
"1708","     cash, bank deposits or cash equivalent securities in an amount necessary to"
"1709","     pay the estimated costs of extinguishing any Excluded Liabilities (as"
"1710","     defined in Section 1.2(c)) and cash in an amount necessary to pay any"
"1711","     distributions pursuant to Section 7.1(g) (collectively, Assets)."
"1712","          (c) The Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the liabilities of the"
"1713","     Target Fund, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at"
"1714","     the Closing Date, except for the Target Fund's Excluded Liabilities (as"
"1715","     defined below), if any, pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, with"
"1716","     respect to each Target Fund separately, Liabilities). Each Target Fund"
"1717","     will use its best efforts to discharge all known Liabilities prior to or at"
"1718","     the Valuation Date (as defined in Section 2.1(a)) to the extent possible"
"1719","     and consistent with its own investment objectives and policies and normal"
"1720","     business operations. If prior to the Closing Date the Acquiring Entity"
"1721","     identifies a liability that the Acquiring Entity and the Target Entity"
"1722","     mutually agree should not be assumed by the Acquiring Fund, such liability"
"1723","     shall be excluded from the definition of Liabilities hereunder and shall be"
"1724","     listed on a Schedule of Excluded Liabilities to be signed by the Acquiring"
"1725","     Entity and the Target Entity at Closing and attached to this Agreement as"
"1726","     Schedule 1.2(c) (the Excluded Liabilities). The Assets minus the"
"1727","     Liabilities of a Target Fund shall be referred to herein as the Target"
"1728","     Fund's Net Assets."
"1729","          (d) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Target"
"1730","     Fund will distribute to its shareholders of record (Target Fund
     Shareholders) the shares of the Acquiring Fund of the corresponding class"
"1731","     received by the Target Fund pursuant to Section 1.2(a), as set forth in"
"1732","     Exhibit A, on a pro rata basis within that class, and without further"
"1733","     notice the outstanding shares of the Target Fund will be redeemed and"
"1734","     cancelled as permitted by its charter and applicable law, and the Target"
"1735","     Fund will as promptly as practicable completely liquidate and dissolve."
"1736","     Such distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with respect to"
"1737","     each class of the Target Fund's shares, by the transfer of the Acquiring"
"1738","     Fund shares of the corresponding class then credited to"
"1739","                                      -2-"

"1742","     accounts on the share records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the"
"1743","     Target Fund Shareholders of the class. The aggregate net asset value of the"
"1744","     Acquiring Fund shares to be so credited to the corresponding Target Fund"
"1745","     Shareholders shall be equal to the aggregate net asset value of the"
"1746","     corresponding Target Fund's shares owned by the Target Fund Shareholders on"
"1747","     the Valuation Date. The Acquiring Fund shall not issue certificates"
"1748","     representing shares in connection with such exchange."
"1749","          (e) Ownership of Acquiring Fund shares will be shown on its books, as"
"1750","     such are maintained by the Acquiring Fund's transfer agent."
"1751","2.   VALUATION"
"1752","     2.1. With respect to each Reorganization:"
"1753","          (a) The value of the Target Fund's Assets shall be the value of such"
"1754","     Assets computed as of immediately after the close of regular trading on the"
"1755","     New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which shall reflect the declaration of"
"1756","     any dividends, on the business day next preceding the Closing Date (the"
"1757","     Valuation Date), using the Target Fund's valuation procedures established"
"1758","     by the Target Entity's Board of Trustees, which shall be provided to the"
"1759","     Acquiring Fund prior to the Valuation Date."
"1760","          (b) The net asset value per share of each class of the Acquiring Fund"
"1761","     shares issued in connection with the Reorganization shall be the net asset"
"1762","     value per share of the corresponding class of the Target Fund as of the"
"1763","     close of business on the Valuation Date, provided that, if more than one"
"1764","     class of shares of the Target Fund is being exchanged for a single class of"
"1765","     shares of the Acquiring Fund, then the net asset value per share of such"
"1766","     class of shares of the Acquiring Fund issued in connection with the"
"1767","     Reorganization shall be the net asset value per share of the corresponding"
"1768","     class of the Target Fund having attributes most consistent with the"
"1769","     Acquiring Fund share class, as determined by the Acquiring Fund (the"
"1770","     Primary Share Class), or the net asset value of such other class of"
"1771","     shares of the Target Fund as the parties may mutually agree."
"1772","          (c) The number of shares issued of each class of the Acquiring Fund"
"1773","     (including fractional shares, if any, rounded to the nearest thousandth) in"
"1774","     exchange for the Target Fund's Net Assets shall equal the number of shares"
"1775","     of the corresponding class of the Target Fund outstanding as of the"
"1776","     Valuation Time, provided that if two or more classes of shares of the"
"1777","     Target Fund are exchanged for a single class of shares of the Acquiring"
"1778","     Fund, then the number of Acquiring Fund shares issued with respect to each"
"1779","     such Target Fund class, other than the Primary Share Class, shall equal the"
"1780","     quotient of the net asset value of such class divided by the net asset"
"1781","     value per share of the Primary Share Class, all as of the Valuation Time."
"1782","          (d) All computations of value shall be made by the Target Fund's"
"1783","     designated recordkeeping agent using the valuation procedures described in"
"1784","     this Section 2 and shall be subject to review by the Acquiring Fund's"
"1785","     recordkeeping agent and, if requested by either the Target Entity or the"
"1786","     Acquiring Entity, by the independent registered public accountant of the"
"1787","     requesting party."

"1791","     3.1. Each Reorganization shall close on June 1, 2010 or such other date as"
"1792","the parties may agree with respect to any or all Reorganizations (the Closing
Date). All acts taking place at the closing of a Reorganization (Closing)"
"1793","shall be deemed to take place simultaneously as of immediately prior to the"
"1794","opening of regular trading on the NYSE on the Closing Date of that"
"1795","Reorganization unless otherwise agreed to by the parties (the Closing Time)."
"1796","The Closing of each Reorganization shall be held in person, by facsimile, email"
