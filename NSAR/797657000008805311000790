"1185","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"1186","Accounting Firm"
"1187","To the Trustees of DWS Advisor Funds and"
"1188","Shareholders of DWS Lifecycle Long Range Fund:"
"1189","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"1190","financial statements of DWS Lifecycle Long Range"
"1191","Fund (the"
"1192","Fund), as of and for the year ended March 31,"
"1193","2011, in accordance with the standards of the"
"1194","Public"
"1195","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1196","States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"1197","control over"
"1198","financial reporting, including control"
"1199","activities for safeguarding securities, as a"
"1200","basis for designing our"
"1201","auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1202","expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1203","statements and to comply with"
"1204","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1205","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1206","effectiveness of the"
"1207","Fund's internal control over financial"
"1208","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"1209","opinion on the"
"1210","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control"
"1211","over financial reporting."
"1212","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1213","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1214","control over"
"1215","financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1216","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1217","management are required to"
"1218","assess the expected benefits and related costs"
"1219","of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"1220","financial reporting is"
"1221","a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1222","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1223","reporting and the"
"1224","preparation of financial statements for external"
"1225","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1226","accounting"
"1227","principles.  A fund's internal control over"
"1228","financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1229","procedures that (1)"
"1230","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1231","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"1232","the transactions"
"1233","and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1234","provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"1235","are recorded as"
"1236","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"1237","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"1238","accounting"
"1239","principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"1240","of the fund are being made only in accordance"
"1241","with"
"1242","authorizations of management and directors of"
"1243","the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance"
"1244","regarding"
"1245","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"1246","acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"1247","assets that could"
"1248","have a material effect on the financial"
"1249","statements."
"1250","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1251","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"1252","or detect"
"1253","misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"1254","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"1255","are subject to the risk"
"1256","that controls may become inadequate because of"
"1257","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1258","compliance with"
"1259","the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1260","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1261","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"1262","a control does"
"1263","not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"1264","course of performing their assigned functions,"
"1265","to prevent"
"1266","or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A"
"1267","material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1268","combination of"
"1269","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1270","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1271","possibility that a"
"1272","material misstatement of the Fund's annual or"
"1273","interim financial statements will not be"
"1274","prevented or detected"
"1275","on a timely basis."
"1276","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control"
"1277","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"1278","purpose"
"1279","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1280","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1281","internal control over"
"1282","financial reporting that might be material"
"1283","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1284","Public Company"
"1285","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1286","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"1287","internal"
"1288","control over financial reporting and its"
"1289","operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1290","securities, that we"
"1291","consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"1292","above as of March 31, 2011."
"1293","This report is intended solely for the"
"1294","information and use of the Trustees, management,"
