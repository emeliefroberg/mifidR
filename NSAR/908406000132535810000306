"2611","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2612","To the Trustees of the American Century Investment Trust and"
"2613","Shareholders of the Prime Money Market Fund, the Premium Money"
"2614","Market Fund, the Diversified Bond Fund, the High-Yield Fund,"
"2615","the NT Diversified Bond Fund, the Short Duration Fund,"
"2616","the Core Plus Fund, and the Inflation Protection Bond Fund:"
"2617","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"2618","of the American Century Investment Trust (the &#147;Funds&#148;)  as of and"
"2619","for the year ended March 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards"
"2620","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"2621","we considered the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting,"
"2622","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"2623","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"2624","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2625","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"2626","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control"
"2627","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion"
"2628","on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial"
"2629","reporting."
"2630","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"2631","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"2632","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"2633","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"2634","costs of controls.  A fund&#146;s internal control over financial reporting"
"2635","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2636","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2637","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2638","accounting principles.  A fund&#146;s internal control over financial"
"2639","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"2640","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"2641","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"2642","of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"2643","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"2644","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"2645","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"2646","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"2647","fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"2648","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"2649","of a fund&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the"
"2650","financial statements."
"2651","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2652","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"2653","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject"
"2654","to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes"
"2655","in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"2656","or procedures may deteriorate."
"2657","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2658","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"2659","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"2660","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"2661","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"2662","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is"
"2663","a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds&#146;"
"2664","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"2665","detected on a timely basis."
"2666","Our consideration of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial"
"2667","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2668","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"2669","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"2670","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"2671","Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"2672","in the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"2673","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"2674","be material weaknesses as defined above as of March 31, 2010."
"2675","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"2676","and the Board of Directors of the American Century Investment Trust and"
"2677","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"2678","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"2829","to the Trust by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate"
"2830","that the Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice to"
"2831","the shareholder at the address, all future notices"
"2832","or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing"
"2833","if these shall be available to the shareholder on written demand of the"
"2834","shareholder at the principal executive office of the Trust for a period"

"2843","represented at that meeting, either in person or by proxy."
"2844","When any meeting of shareholders is adjourned to another time or place,"
"2845","notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting at which the adjournment"
"2846","is taken, unless a new record date of the adjourned meeting is fixed or"

"2848","set for the original meeting, in which case the Board of Trustees shall"
"2849","set a new record date.  Where required, notice of any such adjourned meeting"
"2850","shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the"
"2851","adjourned meeting in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 and 4"

"2856","The shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders shall be"
"2857","determined in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust,"

"2859","by ballot, provided, however, that any election for trustees must be by"
"2860","ballot if demanded by any shareholder before the voting has begun."
"2861","On any matter other than elections of trustees, any shareholder"
"2862","may vote part of the shares in favor"
"2863","of the proposal and refrain from voting the remaining shares or vote them"
"2864","against the proposal, but if the shareholder fails to specify the number"
"2865","of shares which the shareholder is voting affirmatively, it will be"
"2866","conclusively presumed that the shareholder&#146;s approving vote is"
"2867","with respect to the total shares that the"
"2868","shareholder is entitled to vote on such proposal."
"2869","Section 7.  Waiver of Notice by Consent of Absent Shareholders"
"2870","The transactions of the meeting of shareholders, however called and"

"2873","person or by proxy and if either before or after the meeting,"
"2874","each person entitled to vote who was not present in person"
"2875","or by proxy signs a written waiver"
"2876","of notice or a consent to a holding of the meeting or an approval of the"
"2877","minutes.  The waiver of notice or consent need not specify either the"
"2878","business to be transacted or the purpose of any meeting of shareholders."
"2879","Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of"
"2880","notice of that meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning"
"2881","of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting"
"2882","is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at"
"2883","a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration"
"2884","of matters not included in the notice of the meeting if that objection"
"2885","is expressly made at the beginning of the meeting."
"2886","Section 8.  Shareholder Action by Written Consent without a Meeting"
"2887","Any action which may be taken at any meeting of shareholders may be taken"
"2888","without a meeting and without prior notice if a consent in writing setting"
"2889","forth the action so taken is signed by the holders of outstanding shares"
"2890","having not less than the minimum number of votes that"
"2891","would be necessary to authorize or take that action at a meeting at which"
"2892","all shares entitled to vote on that action were present and voted."
"2893","All such consents shall be filed with the Secretary of the Trust"
"2894","and shall be maintained in the Trust&#146;s records.  Any shareholder giving"
"2895","a written consent or the shareholder&#146;s proxy holders or a transferee of"
"2896","the shares or a personal representative of the shareholder"
"2897","or their respective proxy holders may revoke the consent by a writing"
"2898","received by the Secretary of the Trust before written consents of the"
"2899","number of shares required to authorize the proposed action have"
"2900","been filed with the Secretary."
"2901","If the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have not been"
"2902","solicited in writing and if the unanimous written consent of all such"
"2903","shareholders shall not have been received, the Secretary shall give"
"2904","prompt notice of the action approved by the shareholders without"
"2905","a meeting."
"2906"," This notice shall be given in the manner specified in Section 4 of this"
"2907"," Article II.  In the case of approval of (i) contracts or transactions"
"2908","in which a trustee has a direct or indirect financial interest,"
"2909","(ii) indemnification of agents of the Trust, and (iii) a reorganization"
"2910","of the Trust, the notice shall be given at least ten (10) days before the"
"2911","consummation of any action authorized by that approval."
"2912","Section 9.  Record Date for Shareholder Notice, Voting and Giving Consents"

"2915","a meeting, the Board of Trustees may fix in advance a record date which"
"2916","shall not be more than ninety (90) days nor less than ten (10) days"
"2917","before the date of any such meeting as provided in the"
"2918","Declaration of Trust."
"2919","If the Board of Trustees does not so fix a record date:"
"2920","(a)	The record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice"
"2921","of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of"
"2922","business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is"
"2923","given or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business"
"2924","day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held."
"2925","(b)	The record date for determining shareholders entitled to give"
"2926","consent to action in writing without a meeting, (i) when no prior action"
"2927","by the Board of Trustees has been taken, shall be the day on which the"
"2928","first written consent is given, or (ii) when prior action"
"2929","of the Board of Trustees has been taken, shall be at the close of business"
"2930","on the day on which the Board of Trustees adopt the resolution relating"
"2931","to that action or the seventy-fifth day before the date of such"
"2932","other action, whichever is later."
"2933","Section 10.  Proxies"
"2934","Every person entitled to vote for trustees or on any other matter shall"
"2935","have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized"
"2936","by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the Secretary of"
"2937","the Trust.  A proxy shall be deemed signed if the shareholder&#146;s"
"2938","name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting,"
"2939","telegraphic transmission, or by electronic, telephonic, computerized or"
"2940","other alternative form of execution authorized by the"
"2941","Trustees) by the shareholder or the shareholder&#146;s attorney-in-fact."
"2942","A proxy with respect to Shares held in the name of two or more persons"
"2943","shall be valid if executed by one of them unless at or prior to"
"2944","exercise of such proxy the Trust receives specific written notice to the"
"2945","contrary from any one of them.  A proxy purporting to be exercised by or"
"2946","on behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless"
"2947","challenged at or prior to its exercise and the burden of proving"
"2948","invalidity shall rest on the challenger.  A validly executed proxy"
"2949","which does not state that it is irrevocable shall continue in full"
"2950","force and effect unless (i) revoked by the person executing it before"
"2951","the vote pursuant to that proxy by a writing delivered to the Trust"
"2952","stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by,"
"2953","or attendance at the meeting and voting in person by the person executing"
"2954","that proxy; or (ii) written notice of the death or incapacity of the"
"2955","maker of that proxy is received by the Trust before the vote pursuant"
"2956","to that proxy is counted; provided however, that no proxy shall be"
"2957","valid after the expiration of eleven (11) months from the date of"
"2958","the proxy unless otherwise provided in the proxy.  The revocability of"
"2959","a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by"
"2960","the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the Commonwealth of"
"2961","Massachusetts, as if the Trust were a Massachusetts"
"2962","corporation."
"2963","Section 11.  Inspectors of Election"
"2964","Before any meeting of shareholders, the Board of Trustees may appoint any"
"2965","persons other than nominees for office to act as inspectors of election at"
"2966","the meeting or its adjournment.  If no inspectors of election are so"
"2967","appointed, the chairman of the meeting may and on the request"
"2968","of any shareholder or a shareholder&#146;s proxy shall, appoint inspectors"
"2969"," of"
"2970","election at the meeting.  The number of inspectors shall be either one"
"2971","(1) or three (3).  If inspectors are appointed at a meeting"
"2972","on the request of one or more shareholders or proxies, the holders of"
"2973","a majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall"
"2974","determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed."
"2975","If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses"
"2976","to act, the chairman of the meeting may and on the request of any"
"2977","shareholder or a shareholder&#146;s proxy, shall appoint"
"2978","a person to fill the vacancy."
"2979","These inspectors shall:"
"2980","(a)	Determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power"
"2981","of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum"
"2982","and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies;"
"2983","(b)	Receive votes, ballots or consents;"
"2984","(c)	Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way"
"2985","arising in connection with the right to vote;"

"3635","series of any other registered investment company for which the Investment"

"3638","that a registered investment company that invests its assets exclusively"
"3639","in the shares of other registered investment companies shall not be"

"3647","(5)	An &#147;Investment Category&#148; for a Fund is the group to which the Fund"
"3648","is assigned for determining the first component of its management fee. Each"

"3651","Funds appear in Schedule B to this Agreement. The amount of assets in each"
"3652","of the Investment Categories (&#147;Investment Category Assets&#148;) is determined"
"3653","as follows:"

"3655","determine the fee for this Investment Category is the sum of the assets of"
"3656","all of the Primary Strategy Portfolios and Secondary Strategy Portfolios"
"3657","that invest primarily in debt securities and are subject to Rule 2a-7"
"3658","under the Investment Company Act."
"3659","b)	Bond Fund Category Assets. The assets which are used to determine"

"3662","primarily in debt securities and are not subject to Rule 2a-7 under the"
"3663","Investment Company Act."

"3669","is the dollar amount resulting from applying the applicable Investment"
"3670","Category Fee Schedule for the Fund (as shown on Schedule A) using the"
"3671","applicable Investment Category Assets."
"3672","(7)	The &#147;Per Annum Investment Category Fee Rate&#148; for Fund is the"
"3673","percentage rate that results from dividing the Per Annum Investment Category"
"3674","Fee Dollar Amount for the Fund by the applicable Investment Category Assets"
"3675","for the Fund."
"3676","(8)	The &#147;Complex Assets&#148; is the sum of the assets in all of the Primary"
"3677","Strategy Portfolios."
"3678","(9)	The &#147;Per Annum Complex Fee Dollar Amount&#148; for a class of a Fund shall"
"3679","be the dollar amount resulting from application of the Complex Assets to the"
"3680","Complex Fee Schedule for the class as shown in Schedule C."
"3681","(10)	The &#147;Per Annum Complex Fee Rate&#148; for a class of a Fund is the percentage"
"3682","rate that results from dividing the Per Annum Complex Fee Dollar Amount for the"
"3683","class of a Fund by the Complex Assets."
"3684","(11)	The &#147;Per Annum Management Fee Rate&#148; for a class of a Fund is the sum of"
"3685","the Per Annum Investment Category Fee Rate applicable to the Fund and the Per"

"3688","of each Fund shall accrue a fee calculated by multiplying the Per Annum"
"3689","Management Fee Rate for that class times the net assets of the class on that"
"3690","day, and further dividing that product by 365"
"3691","(366 in leap years)."
"3692","(d)	Monthly Management Fee Payment. On the first business day of"
"3693","each month, each class of each series Fund shall pay the management"
"3694","fee to the Investment Manager for the previous month. The fee for the"
"3695","previous month shall be the sum of the Daily Management Fee Calculations"
"3696","for each calendar day in the previous month."

"3714","at any time without penalty by the Board of Directors or by vote of"
"3715","a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such Fund on"
"3716","60 days' written notice to the Investment Manager."

"3726","business, whether of a similar or dissimilar nature, or to render services"
"3727","of any kind to any other corporation, firm, individual or"

"3737","12.	Separate Agreement.  The parties hereto acknowledge that certain"
"3738","provisions of the Investment Company Act, in effect, treat each series of"
