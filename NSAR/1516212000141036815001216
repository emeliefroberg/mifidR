A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</font></div>"

When placing such orders, the primary objective of the Sub-Adviser shall be to obtain the best net price and execution for the Investment Company but this requirement shall not be deemed to obligate the Sub-Adviser to place any order solely on the basis of obtaining the lowest commission rate if the other standards set forth in this section have been satisfied. The Investment Company and Adviser recognize that there are likely to be many cases in which different brokers are equally able to provide such best price and execution and that, in selection among such brokers with respect to particular trades, it is desirable to choose those brokers who furnish &#8220;brokerage and research services&#8221; (as such are described in Section&#160;28(e)(3) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934) or statistical quotations and other information to the Investment Company and/or the Sub-Adviser in accordance with the standards set forth below. Moreover, to the extent that it continues to be lawful to do so and so long as the Board determines as a matter of general policy that the Investment Company will benefit, directly or indirectly, by doing so, the Sub-Adviser may place orders with a broker who charges a commission that is greater than that which another broker would have charged for effecting that transaction, provided that the excess commission is reasonable in relation to the value of brokerage and research services provided by that broker. Accordingly, the Investment Company and the Sub-Adviser agree that the Sub-Adviser shall select brokers for the execution of the Fund&#8217;s investment transactions from among:</font></div>"
