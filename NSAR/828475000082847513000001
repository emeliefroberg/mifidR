A co</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>mpany&#146;s internal </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company&#146;s assets th</FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>at could have a material effect on the financial statements.</FONT></P>"
"535","<P style=text-align: left;>"
"536","<FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

"537","<P style=text-align: left;>"
"538","<FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the </FONT><FONT size=2 face=Franklin Gothic Medium Cond,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif>company&#146;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</FONT></P>"
