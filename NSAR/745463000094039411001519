"7590","October 31, 2011, in accordance with the"
"7591","standards of the Public Company"
"7592","Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"7593","States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"7594","control over financial reporting, including"
"7595","controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"7596","basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"7597","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"7598","the financial statements and to comply with"
"7599","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"7600","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"7601","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"7602","control over financial reporting."
"7603","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"7604","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"7605","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"7606","internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"7607","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"7608","judgments by management are required to"
"7609","assess the expected benefits and related"
"7610","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control"
"7611","over financial reporting is a process designed"

"7613","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"7614","preparation of financial statements for"
"7615","external purposes in accordance with"
"7616","generally accepted accounting principles.  A"

"7623","the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"7624","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"7625","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"7626","accordance with generally accepted"
"7627","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"7628","expenditures of the fund are being made"
"7629","only in accordance with authorizations of"

"7631","trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"7632","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"7633","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"7634","of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"7635","effect on the financial statements."
"7636","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"

"7641","the risk that controls may become"
"7642","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"7643","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"7644","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"7645","A deficiency in internal control over"

"7654","such that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"7655","a material misstatement of a fund's annual or"

"7658","Our consideration of the Fund's internal"
