"775","<DESCRIPTION>AUDITOR'S LETTER"
"776","<TEXT>"
"777","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"778","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of:"
"779","Schwab Monthly Income Fund - Moderate Payout"
"780","Schwab Monthly Income Fund - Enhanced Payout"
"781","Schwab Monthly Income Fund - Maximum Payout"
"782","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"783"," statements of Schwab Monthly Income Fund - Moderate Payout,"
"784"," Schwab Monthly Income Fund - Enhanced Payout"
"785"," and Schwab Monthly Income Fund - Maximum Payout"
"786"," (three portfolios of Schwab Capital Trust,"
"787","hereafter referred to as the Funds)"
"788","as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012,"
"789"," in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"790","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"791"," we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"792","financial reporting, including controls over"
"793","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"794"," our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"795","expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"796"," and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"797"," but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"798","on"
"799"," the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control"
"800","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not"
"801","express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"802","Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"803","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"804","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"805","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling"
"806"," this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"807","management are required to assess the expected"
"808","benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's"
"809","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"810"," designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"811","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"812","preparation of financial statements for external"
"813","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"814","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control"
"815","over financial reporting includes those policies"
"816","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"817","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"818","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"819"," of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"820"," assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"821","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"822","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"823"," accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"824","expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"825","in accordance with authorizations of management"
"826"," and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide"
"827","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"828"," timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"829"," use or disposition of a funds assets that could"
"830"," have a material effect on the financial statements."
"831","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"832"," over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"833"," misstatements.  Also, projections of any"
"834","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"835"," are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"836"," inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"837"," or that the degree of compliance with the"
"838","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"839","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"840"," reporting exists when the design or operation"
"841","of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"842"," in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"843"," functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"844"," a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"845"," deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"846","in internal control over financial reporting,"
"847","such that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"848","a material misstatement of the Funds' annual or"
"849","interim financial statements will not be"
"850","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"851","Our consideration of the Funds internal"
"852","control over financial reporting was for"
"853","the limited purpose described in the first"
"854","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"855","all deficiencies in internal control over"
"856","financial reporting that might be material"
"857","weaknesses under standards established by"
"858","the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"859","Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"860","no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control"
"861","over financial reporting and its operation,"
"862","including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"863","that we consider to be material weaknesses as"
"864","defined above as of December 31, 2012."
"865","This report is intended solely for the information"
"866"," and use of management and the Board of Trustees"
"867"," and Shareholders of the Funds and the Securities"
"868"," and Exchange Commission and is not intended to"
"869"," be and should not be used by anyone other"
"870"," than these specified parties."
