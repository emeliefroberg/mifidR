"1619","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1620","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1621","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"1622","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"

"1639","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
