"1076","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1077","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1078","Trust for Credit Unions"
"1079","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1080","statements of Trust for Credit Unions (comprising the Money"
"1081","Market Portfolio, Ultra-Short Duration Government Portfolio and"
"1082","Short Duration Portfolio, collectively, the Portfolios)  as of"
"1083","and for the year ended August 31, 2010, in accordance with the"
"1084","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1085","(United States), we considered its internal control over"
"1086","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1087","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"1088","the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial"
"1089","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"1090","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1091","effectiveness of the Portfolios' internal control over financial"
"1092","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1093","The management of the Portfolios is responsible for establishing"
"1094","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1095","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1096","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1097","benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"1098","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1099","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1100","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1101","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1102","accounting principles.  A company's internal control over"
"1103","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"1104","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1105","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1106","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"1107","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"1108","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"1109","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"1110","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"1111","with authorizations of management and directors of the company;"
"1112","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"1113","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1114","of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1115","financial statements."
"1116","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1117","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1118","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1119","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1120","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"1121","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1122","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1123","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"1124","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1125","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"1126","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1127","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1128","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1129","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim"
"1130","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"1131","timely basis."
"1132","Our consideration of the Portfolios' internal control over"
"1133","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the"
"1134","first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"1135","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1136","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1137","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"1138","no deficiencies in the Portfolios' internal control over"
"1139","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1140","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"1141","weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2010."
"1142","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1143","management and the Board of Trustees of the Trust for Credit"
"1144","Unions and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"1145","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"1146","specified parties."

"1157","Sub-Item 77K:  Changes in registrant's certifying accountants"
"1158","Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y) was replaced as the independent"
"1159","registered public accounting firm to Trust for Credit Unions"
"1160","(the Trust) effective upon completion of the services related"
"1161","to the audit for the Trust's fiscal year ended August 31, 2010."
"1162","The Trust's Audit Committee participated in, and approved, the"
"1163","decision to change auditors.  E&Y's reports on the Trust's"
"1164","financial statements for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2010"
"1165","and August 31, 2009 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer"
"1166","of opinion nor were they qualified or modified as to"
"1167","uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.  During the"
"1168","Trust's fiscal years ended August 31, 2010 and August 31, 2009"
"1169","and through October 25, 2010, (i) there were no disagreements"
"1170","with E&Y on any matter of accounting principles or practices,"
"1171","financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure,"
"1172","which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y,"
"1173","would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of"
"1174","the disagreements in connection with its reports on the Trust's"
"1175","financial statements for such years, and (ii) there were no"
"1176","reportable events of the kind described in Item 304(a)(1)(v)"
"1177","of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as"
"1178","amended."
"1179","On October 7, 2010, the Trust by action of its Board of Trustees"
"1180","upon the recommendation of the Trust's Audit Committee engaged"
"1181","Tait, Weller & Baker LLP as the independent registered public"
"1182","accounting firm to audit the Trust's financial statements for"
"1183","the fiscal year ending August 31, 2011.  During the Trust's"
"1184","fiscal years ended August 31, 2010 and August 31, 2009 and"
"1185","through October 25, 2010, neither the Trust, its portfolios nor"
"1186","anyone on their behalf has consulted with Tait, Weller & Baker"
"1187","LLP on items which (i) concerned the application of accounting"
"1188","principles to a specified transaction, either completed or"
"1189","proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on"
"1190","the Trust's financial statements; or (ii) concerned the subject"
"1191","of a disagreement (as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of Item"
"1192","304 of Regulation S-K) or reportable events (as described in"
"1193","paragraph (a)(1)(v) of said Item 304)."
"1194","The Registrant has requested E&Y to furnish it with a letter"
"1195","addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating"
"1196","whether E&Y agrees with the statements contained above.  A copy"
"1197","of the letter from E&Y, dated October 26, 2010 to the"
