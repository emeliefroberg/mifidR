"531","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"532","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Legg Mason Capital"
"533","Management Growth Trust, Inc.:"
"534","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"535","of Legg Mason Capital Management Growth Trust, Inc. (the
Company) as of and for the year ended October 31, 2010 in"
"536","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"537","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Companys
internal control over financial reporting, including controls over
safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing
procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the
financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form
N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial"
"538","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"539","effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial"
"540","reporting."
"541","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and"
"542","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"543","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"544","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"545","related costs of controls.  A companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of a companys assets that could have a material"
"546","effect on the financial statements."
"547","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"548","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"549","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"550","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"551","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"552","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"553","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"554","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"555","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"556","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"557","basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"558","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"559","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"560","misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial"
"561","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"562","Our consideration of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph
and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control
over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under
standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Companys"
"563","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"564","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material"
"565","weaknesses as defined above as of October 31, 2010."
"566","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"567","and the Board of Directors of Legg Mason Capital Management Growth Trust,Inc."
"568","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"569","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."
