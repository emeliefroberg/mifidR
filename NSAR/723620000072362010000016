"1088","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1089","Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"1090","Neuberger Berman Income Funds"
"1091","New York, New York"
"1092","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1093","statements of Neuberger Berman TaxFree Money Fund,"
"1094","a series of Neuberger Berman Income Funds (formerly"
"1095","Lehman Brothers Income Funds) (the Fund) as of and"
"1096","for the year ended March 31, 2010, in accordance with"
"1097","the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1098","Oversight Board (United States), we considered its internal"
"1099"," control over financial reporting, including control"
"1100","activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1101","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1102","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"1103","to comply with the requirements of Form NSAR, but"
"1104","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1105","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"
"1106","reporting.   Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1107","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"1108"," and maintaining effective internal control over"
"1109","financial reporting.   In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1110","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"1111","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"1112","A companys internal control over financial"
"1113","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1114"," regarding the reliability of financial reporting"
"1115","and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1116","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1117","accounting principles.   A companys internal control over"
"1118","financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1119","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"1120","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1121","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"1122","the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1123","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"1124","of financial statements in accordance with"
"1125","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"1126","and expenditures of the company are being made"
"1127","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1128","directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"1129","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1130","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"1131","of a companys assets that could have a material"
"1132","effect on the financial statements."
"1133","Because of inherent limitations, internal control"
"1134","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1135","misstatements.   Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1136","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1137","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1138","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with"
"1139","the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1140","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1141","exists when the design or operation of a control does"
"1142","not allow management or employees, in the normal course"
"1143","of performing their assigned functions, to prevent"
"1144","or detect misstatements on a timely basis.   A material"
"1145","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"1146","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1147","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"1148","material misstatement of the companys annual or interim"
"1149","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1150","detected on a timely basis."
