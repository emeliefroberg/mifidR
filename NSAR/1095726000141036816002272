"576","Amended and Restated Plan pursuant to Rule 18f-3(d)"
"577","under the Investment Company Act of 1940"
"578","Effective as of January 12, 2016"
"579","Each series of Gateway Trust, Natixis Funds Trust I, Natixis Funds"
"580","Trust II, Natixis Funds Trust IV, Loomis Sayles Funds I and"

"594","class, and shall have exclusive voting rights on any matter"
"595","submitted to shareholders that relates solely to that class; and (d)"
"596","each class may have different conversion and exchange rights, as"

"603","subject to change, to the extent permitted by law and by the"
"604","Declaration of Trust and By-Laws of each Trust, by action of the"
"605","Board of Trustees of each Trust. In such instances, the treatment"

"656","from time to time in effect)."
"657","Class C shares pay, pursuant to the 12b-1 Plans, a distribution fee of"

"815","advisory fees or other expenses related to the management of the"

"819","The gross income of each Fund generally shall be allocated to each"
"820","class on the basis of net assets.  To the extent practicable, certain"
"821","expenses (other than Class Expenses as defined above, which shall"
"822","be allocated more specifically) shall be subtracted from the gross"
"823","income on the basis of the net assets of each class of each Fund."
"824","These expenses include:"
"825","*	Expenses incurred by a Trust (including, but not limited to,"
"826","fees of Trustees, insurance and legal counsel) not"
"827","attributable to a particular Fund or to a particular class of"
"828","shares of a Fund (Trust Level Expenses); and"
"829","Expenses incurred by a Fund not attributable to any"
"830","particular class of the Funds shares (for example, advisory"
"831","fees, custodial fees or other expenses relating to the"
"832","management of the Funds assets) (Fund Expenses)."
"833","Expenses of a Fund shall be apportioned to each class of shares"
"834","depending upon the nature of the expense item.  Trust Level"
"835","Expenses and Fund Expenses shall be allocated among the classes"
"836","of shares based on their relative net assets in relation to the net"
"837","assets of the relevant Trust.  Approved Class Expenses shall be"
"838","allocated to the particular class to which they are attributable."
"839","However, if a Class Expense can no longer be attributed to a class,"
"840","it will be charged to a Fund for allocation among classes in"
"841","proportion to the net assets of each such class.  Any additional Class"
"842","Expenses not specifically identified above that are subsequently"
"843","identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of"
"844","shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the Board of"

"847","Each Trust reserves the right to utilize any other appropriate method"
"848","to allocate income and expenses among the classes, including those"
"849","specified in Rule 18f-3(c)(1), provided that a majority of the"

"862","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"863","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Natixis Funds Trust IV:"
"864","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of the AEW"
"865","Real Estate Fund, the sole series of Natixis Funds Trust IV (the Fund) as"
"866","of and for the year ended January 31, 2016, in accordance with the standards"
"867","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"868","considered the Funds internal control over financial reporting,"
"869","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"870","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"871","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"872","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"873","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"874","not express an opinion on the effectiveness"
"875","of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"876","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"877","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"878","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"879","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"880","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"881","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"882","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"883","generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over"
"884","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"885","to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"886","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"887","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"888","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"889","accepted accounting principles, and that receiptsand expenditures of the"
"890","fund is being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"891","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"892","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"893","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"894","financial statements."
"895","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"896","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"897","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"898","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"899","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"900","deteriorate."
"901","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"902","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"903","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"904","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness"
"905","is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"906","over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that"
"907","a material misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial"
"908","statements will not be prevented or"
"909","detected on a timely basis."
"910","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"911","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"912","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"913","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"914","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"915","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"916","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"917","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material"
"918","weaknesses as defined above as of January 31, 2016."
"919","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"920","and the Board of Trustees of Natixis Funds Trust IV and the Securities and"
"921","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used"
"922","by anyone other than these specified parties."
