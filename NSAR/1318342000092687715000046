"3287","In planning and performing our audits of the"

"3293","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"3294","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"3295","States), we considered their internal control over"
"3296","financial reporting, including control activities for"
"3297","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"3298","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"3299","opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"3300","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"3301","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"3302","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"3303","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"3304","opinion."
"3305","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"3306","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"3307","over financial reporting.   In fulfilling this"
"3308","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3309","management are required to assess the expected"
"3310","benefits and related costs of controls.   A companys"
"3311","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"3312","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"3313","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"3314","preparation of financial statements for external"
"3315","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"3316","accounting principles.   A companys internal control"
"3317","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"3318","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"3319","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"3320","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"3321","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"3322","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"3323","to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3324","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"3325","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"3326","company are being made only in accordance with"
"3327","authorizations of management and directors of the"

"3329","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"3330","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"3331","companys assets that could have a material effect on"
"3332","the financial statements."
"3333","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3334","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"3335","misstatements.   Also, projections of any evaluation"
"3336","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"3337","risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"3338","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"3339","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"3340","deteriorate."
"3341","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"3342","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"

"3344","the normal course of performing their assigned"

"3346","timely basis.   A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"3347","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"3348","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"3349","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"3350","companys annual or interim financial statements will"
"3351","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3352","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"3353","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"3354","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3355","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"3356","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"3357","established by the Public Company Accounting"
"3358","Oversight Board (United States).   However, we noted"
"3359","no deficiencies in the Funds internal control over"
"3360","financial reporting and its operation, including"
"3361","controls for safeguarding securities, which we"
"3362","consider to be material weaknesses, as defined"
"3363","above, as of December 31, 2014."
"3364","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"3365","use of management, Shareholders and Board of"
