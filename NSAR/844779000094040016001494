"776","(d) The Sub-Adviser is responsible for and appointed to"
"777","act upon, or refrain from acting upon, all proxies"

"809","Board and the officers of the Trust and in compliance"
"810","with (i) except as set forth in the Investment"

"832","provided to the Sub-Adviser in writing (Adviser
Procedures). The Sub-Adviser shall maintain compliance"
"833","procedures and operational processes for the Fund that"

"836","believes are adequate to ensure its compliance with"
"837","applicable law.  No supervisory activity undertaken by"
"838","the Adviser shall limit the Sub-Adviser's responsibility"
"839","for compliance with any of the foregoing."
"840","Notwithstanding the above, the Adviser acknowledges that"
"841","in instances where compliance with applicable laws,"
"842","regulations, policies, procedures or guidelines is"
"843","dependent on the composition of the holdings of the"
"844","entire Fund, the Sub-Adviser is only responsible for"
"845","ensuring compliance in the Managed Portion."
"846","(f) The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not knowingly"
"847","consult with any other sub-investment adviser for the"
"848","Fund or the Trust or any other fund under common control"
"849","with the Trust, concerning transactions for the Managed"
"850","Portion in securities or other assets, except that such"
"851","consultations are permitted between the current and"
"852","successor sub-investment advisers of the Fund in order"
"853","to effect an orderly transition of sub-advisory duties"
"854","so long as such consultations are not transactions"
"855","prohibited by Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act."
"856","(g) On behalf of the Fund, the Adviser hereby authorizes"
"857","any entity or person associated with the Sub-Adviser"
"858","which is a member of a national securities exchange to"
"859","effect any transaction on the exchange for the account"

"862","behalf of the Fund, the Adviser hereby consents to the"
"863","retention of compensation for such transactions in"
"864","accordance with Rule 11a2-2(T)(a)(2)(iv)."
"865","Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sub-Adviser agrees"
"866","that it will not knowingly deal with itself, or with"
"867","members of the Board or any principal underwriter of the"
"868","Fund, as principals or agents in making purchases or"
"869","sales of securities or other property for the account of"
"870","the Fund, nor will the Sub-Adviser purchase any"
"871","securities from an underwriting or selling group in"
"872","which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates is"
"873","participating, or arrange for purchases and sales of"
"874","securities between the Fund and another account advised"
"875","by the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates, except in each"
"876","case as permitted by the 1940 Act and in accordance with"
"877","such policies and procedures as may be adopted by the"
"878","Fund from time to time and disclosed to, and"
"879","acknowledged by, the Sub-Adviser, and will comply with"
"880","all other provisions of the Governing Documents and the"
"881","Fund's then-current Registration Statement relative to"
"882","the Sub-Adviser and its directors, officers and"
"883","employees."
"884","3.	Fund Transactions."
"885","(a) In connection with purchases and sales of portfolio"
"886","securities and other instruments of the Managed Portion"
"887","for the account of the Fund, neither the Sub-Adviser nor"
"888","its affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) or"
"889","any of their respective partners, officers or employees"
"890","shall act as principal, except as otherwise permitted by"
"891","the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser or its agents shall"
"892","arrange for the placing of orders for the purchase and"
"893","sale of portfolio securities and other financial"
"894","instruments of the Managed Portion for the Fund's"
"895","account either directly with the issuer or with any"
"896","Counterparty, provided that the Sub-Adviser complies"
"897","with Section 2(b) with respect to each such"
"898","Counterparty."
"899","(b) In the selection of such brokers or dealers, as"
"900","permitted in accordance with the list of Counterparties"
"901","with which the Managed Portion is permitted to engage in"
"902","transactions, and the placing of such orders, the Sub-"
"903","Adviser is directed at all times to seek to obtain for"
"904","the Managed Portion the most favorable execution and net"
"905","price available. It is also understood that it may be"
"906","desirable for the Managed Portion that the Sub-Adviser"
"907","have access to supplemental investment and market"
"908","research and security and economic analyses that are"
"909","consistent with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"910","Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act) and Section"
"911","11.6 of the Financial Conduct Authority's Conduct of"
"912","Business Handbook (the FCA COB), and are provided by"
"913","brokers who may execute brokerage transactions at a"
"914","higher cost to the Managed Portion than may result when"
"915","allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of"
"916","seeking the most favorable price and efficient"
"917","execution. Therefore, subject to compliance with the"
"918","safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act,"
"919","Section 11.6 of the FCA COB, and such other conditions"
"920","and limitations as may be established by the Adviser"
"921","from time to time and communicated to the Sub-Adviser in"
"922","writing, if any, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to"
"923","consider such services provided to the Managed Portion"
"924","and other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or any of"
"925","its affiliates exercises investment discretion and to"
"926","place orders for the purchase and sale of securities for"
"927","the Managed Portion with such brokers, if the Sub-"
"928","Adviser determines in good faith that the amount of"
"929","commissions for executing such portfolio transactions is"
"930","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"931","research services provided by such brokers, subject to"
"932","review by the Adviser and the Board from time to time"
"933","with respect to the extent and continuation of this"
"934","practice. It is understood that the services provided by"
"935","such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in"
"936","connection with its services to other clients. The Sub-"
"937","Adviser may, on occasions when it deems the purchase or"
"938","sale of a security to be in the best interests of the"
"939","Managed Portion as well as its other clients, aggregate,"
"940","to the extent permitted by applicable laws, rules and"
"941","regulations, the securities to be sold or purchased in"
"942","order to seek to obtain the best net price and the most"
"943","favorable execution. In such event, allocation of the"
"944","securities so purchased or sold, as well as the expenses"
"945","incurred in the transaction, shall be made by the Sub-"
"946","Adviser in the manner it considers to be the most"
"947","equitable and consistent with its obligations to the"
"948","Managed Portion and to such other clients. The Board may"
"949","from time to time adopt policies and procedures that"
"950","modify and/or restrict the Sub-Adviser's authority"
"951","regarding the execution of the Managed Portion's"
"952","portfolio transactions provided herein, which changes"
"953","shall be communicated to the Sub-Adviser in writing and"
"954","to which Sub-Adviser shall be subject only upon actual"
"955","receipt of such notice."
"956","(c) The Sub-Adviser shall not acquire on behalf of the"
"957","Managed Portion any equity securities registered under"
"958","Section 12 of the 1934 Act with the purpose or effect,"
"959","at the time of such acquisition, of changing or"
"960","influencing control of the issuer of the securities or"
"961","in connection with or as a participant in any"
"962","transaction having such purpose or effect, including any"
"963","transaction subject to Rule 13d-3(b) promulgated under"
"964","the 1934 Act. For purposes of all applicable filing"
"965","requirements under the 1934 Act, including without"
"966","limitation Sections 13(d), (f) and (g), and other laws,"
"967","the Sub-Adviser shall be deemed to have sole investment"
"968","discretion with respect to all securities held in the"
"969","Managed Portion and shall have the authority to make any"
"970","filing required under Sections 13(d), (f) and (g).  If"
"971","the Sub-Adviser is required to file any other report"
"972","specifically in regards to the Managed Portion with any"
"973","governmental or self-regulatory agency or organization"
"974","or exchange, the Sub-Adviser shall provide the Adviser"
"975","with prompt written notice thereof, setting forth in"
"976","reasonable detail the nature of the report and the"
"977","investments of the Managed Portion to be reported."
"978","(d) The Fund may establish one or more wholly-owned"
"979","subsidiaries of the Fund through which it may conduct a"
"980","significant portion of its commodities investing"
"981","activities or for other investment purposes."
"982","4. Compensation of the Sub-Adviser."

"984","by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, Adviser,"
"985","not the Fund, shall pay to the Sub-Adviser a fee,"

"2032","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2033","To the Shareholders of BlackRock Multi-Manager Alternative"
"2034","Strategies Fund and Board of Trustees of BlackRock Funds:"
"2035","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"2036","of BlackRock Multi-Manager Alternative Strategies Fund (the"
"2037","Fund), a series of BlackRock Funds, as of and for the year"
"2038","ended August 31, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the"
"2039","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"2040","considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"2041","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"2042","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"2043","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2044","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"2045","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"2046","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"2047","express no such opinion."
"2048","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"2049","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"2050","reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"2051","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"2052","benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal"
"2053","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"2054","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2055","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"2056","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2057","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"2058","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"2059","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"2060","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"2061","dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"2062","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2063","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"2064","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"2065","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"2066","authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and (3)"
"2067","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"2068","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a"
"2069","fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"2070","statements."
"2071","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"2072","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"2073","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2074","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"2075","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"2076","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures"
"2077","may deteriorate."
"2078","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2079","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"2080","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"2081","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"2082","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2083","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"2084","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"2085","material misstatement of the fund's annual or interim financial"
"2086","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"2087","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"2088","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2089","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"2090","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"2091","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"2092","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"2093","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"2094","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities that"
"2095","we consider to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of"
"2096","August 31, 2016."

"2098","management of BlackRock Multi-Manager Alternative Strategies"
"2099","Fund, and the Board of Trustees of BlackRock Funds, and the"
