"6284","Trust (each a Trust and, collectively, the"
"6285","Trusts) are valuable assets that are vital to"
"6286","the each Trusts success.  The Trusts senior"
"6287","financial officers (SFOs) are responsible for"
"6288","conducting the Trusts business in a manner"
"6289","that demonstrates a commitment to the highest"
"6290","standards of integrity. The Trusts SFOs"
"6291","include the principal executive officer, the"
"6292","principal financial officer, comptroller or"
"6293","principal accounting officer, and any person"
"6294","who performs a similar function."
"6295","The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act)"
"6296","effected sweeping corporate disclosure and"
"6297","financial reporting reform on public"
"6298","companies, including mutual funds, to address"
"6299","corporate malfeasance and assure investors"
"6300","that the companies in which they invest are"
"6301","accurately and completely disclosing financial"
"6302","information.  Under the Act, all public"
"6303","companies (including the Trusts) must either"
"6304","have a code of ethics for their SFOs, or"
"6305","disclose why they do not.  The Act was"
"6306","intended to foster corporate environments"
"6307","which encourage employees to question and"
"6308","report unethical and potentially illegal"
"6309","business practices.  Each Trust has chosen to"
"6310","adopt this Financial Officer Code of Ethics"
"6311","(the Code) to encourage its SFOs to act in a"
"6312","manner consistent with the highest principles"
"6313","of ethical conduct."
"6314","2.	Purposes of the Code"
"6315","The purposes of this Code are:"
"6316","To promote honest and ethical conduct"
"6317","by each Trusts SFOs, including the"
"6318","ethical handling of actual or"
"6319","apparent conflicts of interest"
"6320","between personal and professional"
"6321","relationships;"
"6322","To assist each Trusts SFOs in"
"6323","recognizing and avoiding conflicts of"
"6324","interest, including disclosing to an"
"6325","appropriate person any material"
"6326","transaction or relationship that"
"6327","reasonably could be expected to give"
"6328","rise to such a conflict;"
"6329","To promote full, fair, accurate,"
"6330","timely, and understandable disclosure"
"6331","in reports and documents that the"
"6332","Trusts file with, or submit to, the"
"6333","SEC and in other public"
"6334","communications made by the Trusts;"
"6335","To promote compliance with applicable"
"6336","laws, rules and regulations;"
"6337","To encourage the prompt internal"
"6338","reporting to an appropriate person of"
"6339","violations of this Code; and"
"6340","To establish accountability for"
"6341","adherence to this Code."
"6342","3.	Questions about this Code"
"6343","Each Trusts compliance officer designated to"
"6344","oversee compliance with the Trusts Code of"
"6345","Ethics adopted pursuant to Rule 17j-1 shall"
"6346","serve as Compliance Officer for the"
"6347","implementation and administration of this"
"6348","Code.  You should direct your questions about"
"6349","this Code to the Compliance Officer."
"6350","4.	Conduct Guidelines"
"6351","Each Trust has adopted the following"
"6352","guidelines under which the Trusts SFOs must"
"6353","perform their official duties and conduct the"
"6354","business affairs of the Trust."
"6355","a)	Ethical and honest conduct is of"
"6356","paramount importance.  Each Trusts SFOs"
"6357","must act with honesty and integrity and"
"6358","avoid violations of this Code, including"
"6359","the avoidance of actual or apparent"
"6360","conflicts of interest with the Trust in"
"6361","personal and professional relationships."
"6362","b)	SFOs must disclose material transactions"
"6363","or relationships. Each Trusts SFOs must"
"6364","disclose to the Compliance Officer any"
"6365","actual or apparent conflicts of interest"
"6366","the SFO may have with the Trust that"
"6367","reasonably could be expected to give"
"6368","rise to any violations of this Code."
"6369","Such conflicts of interest may arise as"
"6370","a result of material transactions or"
"6371","business or personal relationships to"
"6372","which the SFO may be a party.  If it is"
"6373","not possible to disclose the matter to"
"6374","the Compliance Officer, it should be"
"6375","disclosed to the Trusts Chief Financial"
"6376","Officer, Chief Executive Officer or"
"6377","another appropriate person.  In addition"
"6378","to disclosing any actual or apparent"
"6379","conflicts of interest in which an SFO is"
"6380","personally involved, the Trusts SFOs"
"6381","have an obligation to report any other"
"6382","actual or apparent conflicts which they"
"6383","discover or of which they otherwise"
"6384","become aware.  If you are unsure whether"
"6385","a particular fact pattern gives rise to"
"6386","a conflict of interest, or whether a"
"6387","particular transaction or relationship"
"6388","is material, you should bring the matter"
"6389","to the attention of the Compliance"
"6390","Officer."
"6391","c)	Standards for quality of information"
"6392","shared with service providers of the"
"6393","Trusts.  Each Trusts SFOs must at all"
"6394","times seek to provide information to the"
"6395","Trusts service providers (adviser,"
"6396","administrator, outside auditor, outside"
"6397","counsel, custodian, etc.) that is"
"6398","accurate, complete, objective, relevant,"
"6399","timely, and understandable."
"6400","d)	Standards for quality of information"
"6401","included in periodic reports. Each"
"6402","Trusts SFOs must at all times endeavor"
"6403","to ensure full, fair, timely, accurate,"
"6404","and understandable disclosure in the"
"6405","Trusts periodic reports."
"6406","e)	Compliance with laws.  Each Trusts SFOs"
"6407","must comply with the federal securities"
"6408","laws and other laws and rules applicable"
"6409","to the Trusts, such as the Internal"
"6410","Revenue Code."
"6411","f)	Standard of care.  Each Trusts SFOs must"
"6412","at all times act in good faith and with"
"6413","due care, competence and diligence,"
"6414","without misrepresenting material facts"
"6415","or allowing your independent judgment to"
"6416","be subordinated. Each Trusts SFOs must"
"6417","conduct the affairs of the Trust in a"
"6418","responsible manner, consistent with this"
"6419","Code."
"6420","g)	Confidentiality of information. Each"
"6421","Trusts SFOs must respect and protect the"
"6422","confidentiality of information acquired"
"6423","in the course of their professional"
"6424","duties, except when authorized by the"
"6425","Trust to disclose it or where disclosure"
"6426","is otherwise legally mandated.  You may"
"6427","not use confidential information"
"6428","acquired in the course of your work for"
"6429","personal advantage."
"6430","h)	Sharing of information and educational"
"6431","standards.  Each Trusts SFOs should"
"6432","share information with relevant parties"
"6433","to keep them informed of the business"
"6434","affairs of the Trust, as appropriate,"
"6435","and maintain skills important and"
"6436","relevant to the Trusts needs."
"6437","i)	Promote ethical conduct. Each Trusts"
"6438","SFOs should at all times proactively"
"6439","promote ethical behavior among peers in"
"6440","your work environment."
"6441","j)	Standards for recordkeeping.  Each"
"6442","Trusts SFOs must at all times endeavor"
"6443","to ensure that the Trusts financial"
"6444","books and records are thoroughly and"
"6445","accurately maintained to the best of"
"6446","their knowledge in a manner consistent"
"6447","with applicable laws and this Code."
"6448","5.	Waivers of this Code"
"6449","You may request a waiver of a provision of"
"6450","this Code by submitting your request in"
"6451","writing to the Compliance Officer for"
"6452","appropriate review.  For example, if a family"
"6453","member works for a service provider that"
"6454","prepares a Trusts financial statements, you"
"6455","may have a potential conflict of interest in"
"6456","reviewing those statements and should seek a"
"6457","waiver of this Code to review the work.  An"
"6458","executive officer of each Trust, or another"
"6459","appropriate person (such as a designated Board"
"6460","or Audit Committee member), will decide"
"6461","whether to grant a waiver.  All waivers of"
"6462","this code must be disclosed to the applicable"
"6463","Trusts shareholders to the extent required by"
"6464","SEC rules."
"6465","6.	Affirmation of the Code"
"6466","Upon adoption of the Code, each Trusts SFOs"
"6467","must affirm in writing that they have"
"6468","received, read and understand the Code, and"
"6469","annually thereafter must affirm that they have"
"6470","complied with the requirements of the Code. To"
"6471","the extent necessary, each Trusts Compliance"
"6472","Officer will provide guidance on the conduct"
"6473","required by this Code and the manner in which"
"6474","violations or suspected violations must be"
"6475","reported and waivers must be requested."
"6476","7.	Reporting Violations"
"6477","In the event that an SFO discovers or, in good"
"6478","faith, suspects a violation of this Code, the"
"6479","SFO must immediately report the violation or"
"6480","suspected violation to the Compliance Officer."
"6481","The Compliance Officer may, in his discretion,"
"6482","consult with another member of the Trusts"
"6483","senior management or the Board in determining"
"6484","how to address the suspected violation.  For"
"6485","example, a Code violation may occur when a"
"6486","periodic report or financial statement of a"
"6487","Trust omits a material fact, or is technically"
"6488","accurate but, in the view of the SFO, is"
"6489","written in a way that obscures its meaning."
"6490","SFOs who report violations or suspected"
"6491","violations in good faith will not be subject"
"6492","to retaliation of any kind.  Reported"
"6493","violations will be investigated and addressed"
"6494","promptly and will be treated as confidential"
"6495","to the extent possible."
"6496","8.	Violations of the Code"
"6497","Dishonest or unethical conduct or conduct that"
"6498","is illegal will constitute a violation of this"
"6499","Code, regardless of whether this Code"
"6500","specifically refers to such particular"
"6501","conduct.  A violation of this Code may result"
"6502","in disciplinary action, up to and including"
"6503","removal as an SFO of the Trust.  A variety of"
"6504","laws apply to the Trusts and their operations,"
"6505","including the Securities Act of 1933, the"
"6506","Investment Company Act of 1940, state laws"
"6507","relating to duties owed by Trust officers, and"
"6508","criminal laws. The Trusts will report any"
"6509","suspected criminal violations to the"
"6510","appropriate authorities, and will investigate,"
"6511","address and report, as appropriate, non-"
"6512","criminal violations."

"6522","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"6523","SEI Institutional Investments Trust:"
"6524","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"6525","financial statements of SEI Institutional"
"6526","Investments Trust (the Trust), comprising the Large"
"6527","Cap Fund, Large Cap Diversified Alpha Fund, Large"

"6541","the twenty-two funds comprising the Trust) as of and"
"6542","for the year or period ended May 31, 2014, in"
"6543","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"6544","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"6545","considered the Trusts internal control over"
"6546","financial reporting, including controls over"
"6547","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"6548","our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"6549","expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"6550","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"6551","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"6552","the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"6553","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"6554","opinion."
"6555","Management of the Trust is responsible for"
"6556","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"6557","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"6558","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"6559","management are required to assess the expected"
"6560","benefits and related costs of controls. A companys"
"6561","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"6562","process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"6563","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"6564","the preparation of financial statements for external"
"6565","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"6566","accounting principles. A companys internal control"
"6567","over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"6568","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"6569","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"6570","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"6571","the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"6572","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"6573","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"6574","statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"6575","accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"6576","expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"6577","accordance with authorizations of management and"
"6578","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"6579","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"6580","of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of"
"6581","the companys assets that could have a material"
"6582","effect on the financial statements."
"6583","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"6584","control over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"6585","detect misstatements. Also, projections of any"
"6586","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"6587","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"6588","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"6589","the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"6590","procedures may deteriorate."
"6591","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"6592","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"6593","control does not allow management or employees, in"
"6594","the normal course of performing their assigned"
"6595","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"6596","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"6597","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"6598","control over financial reporting, such that there is"
"6599","a reasonable possibility that a material"
"6600","misstatement of the Trusts annual or interim"
"6601","financial statements will not be prevented or"
"6602","detected on a timely basis."
"6603","Our consideration of the Trusts internal control"
"6604","over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"6605","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"6606","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"6607","control that might be material weaknesses under"
"6608","standards established by the Public Company"
"6609","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"6610","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trusts"
"6611","internal control over financial reporting and its"

"6632","A lawsuit entitled Steven Curd and Rebel Curd v. SEI"
"6633","Investments Management Corporation was filed against"
"6634","SIMC in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern"

"6636","plaintiffs bring the case as a shareholder"
"6637","derivative action against SIMC on behalf of certain"
"6638","SEI funds. The claims are based on Section 36(b) of"
"6639","the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,"
"6640","which allows shareholders of a mutual fund to sue"
"6641","the investment adviser of the fund for an alleged"
"6642","breach of fiduciary duty with respect to"
"6643","compensation received by the adviser. The plaintiffs"

"6647","High Yield Bond, Tax-Managed Large Cap, and Tax-"

"6675","       AGREEMENT made as of this 11th day of December,"

"6698","advisory services."
"6699","       NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as"
"6700","follows:"
"6701","1.	Duties of the Sub-Adviser.  Subject to"
"6702","supervision by the Adviser and the Trusts"
"6703","Board of Trustees, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"6704","manage all of the securities and other assets"
"6705","of each Fund entrusted to it hereunder (the"
"6706","Assets), including the purchase, retention and"

"6711","information, as currently in effect and as"
"6712","amended or supplemented from time to time"
"6713","(referred to collectively as the Prospectus),"
"6714","and subject to the following:"
"6715","(a)	The Sub-Adviser shall, in consultation"
"6716","with and subject to the direction of the"
"6717","Adviser, determine from time to time"
"6718","what Assets will be purchased, retained"
"6719","or sold by a Fund, and what portion of"
"6720","the Assets will be invested or held"
"6721","uninvested in cash."
"6722","(b)	In the performance of its duties and"
"6723","obligations under this Agreement, the"
"6724","Sub-Adviser shall act in conformity with"
"6725","the Trusts Declaration of Trust (as"
"6726","defined herein) and the Prospectus and"
"6727","with the instructions and directions of"
"6728","the Adviser and of the Board of Trustees"
"6729","of the Trust and will conform to and"

"6735","(c)	The Sub-Adviser shall determine the"
"6736","Assets to be purchased or sold by a Fund"
"6737","as provided in subparagraph (a) and will"
"6738","place orders with or through such"
"6739","persons, brokers or dealers to carry out"
"6740","the policy with respect to brokerage set"
"6741","forth in a Funds Prospectus or as the"
"6742","Board of Trustees or the Adviser may"
"6743","direct from time to time, in conformity"
"6744","with all federal securities laws.  In"
"6745","executing Fund transactions and"
"6746","selecting brokers or dealers, the Sub-"
"6747","Adviser will use its best efforts to"
"6748","seek on behalf of each Fund the best"
"6749","overall terms available.  In assessing"
"6750","the best overall terms available for any"
"6751","transaction, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"6752","consider all factors that it deems"
"6753","relevant, including the breadth of the"
"6754","market in the security, the price of the"
"6755","security, the financial condition and"

"6757","dealer, and the reasonableness of the"
"6758","commission, if any, both for the"
"6759","specific transaction and on a continuing"
"6760","basis.  In evaluating the best overall"
"6761","terms available, and in selecting the"
"6762","broker-dealer to execute a particular"
"6763","transaction, the Sub-Adviser may also"
"6764","consider the brokerage and research"
"6765","services provided (as those terms are"
"6766","defined in Section 28(e) of the"
"6767","Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the"
"6768","Exchange Act)).  Consistent with any"
"6769","guidelines established by the Board of"
"6770","Trustees of the Trust and Section 28(e)"
"6771","of the Exchange Act, the Sub-Adviser is"
"6772","authorized to pay to a broker or dealer"
"6773","who provides such brokerage and research"
"6774","services a commission for executing a"
"6775","portfolio transaction for a Fund which"
"6776","is in excess of the amount of commission"
"6777","another broker or dealer would have"
"6778","charged for effecting that transaction"
"6779","if, but only if, the Sub-Adviser"
"6780","determines in good faith that such"
"6781","commission was reasonable in relation to"
"6782","the value of the brokerage and research"
"6783","services provided by such broker or"
"6784","dealer -- viewed in terms of that"
"6785","particular transaction or in terms of"
"6786","the overall responsibilities of the Sub-"
"6787","Adviser to its discretionary clients,"
"6788","including a Fund.  In addition, the Sub-"
"6789","Adviser is authorized to allocate"

"7455","SEI INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS TRUST"
"7456","       AGREEMENT made as of this 12th day of December,"
"7457","2013 between SEI Investments Management Corporation"
"7458","(the Adviser) and Neuberger Berman Fixed Income LLC"
"7459","(the Sub-Adviser)."
"7460","	WHEREAS, SEI Institutional Investments Trust,"
"7461","a Massachusetts business trust (the Trust), is"
"7462","registered as an open-end management investment"
"7463","company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as"
"7464","amended (the 1940 Act); and"
"7465","       WHEREAS, the Adviser has entered into an"
"7466","Investment Advisory Agreement dated June 14, 1986,"
"7467","as amended (the Advisory Agreement), with the Trust,"
"7468","pursuant to which the Adviser acts as investment"
"7469","adviser to each series of the Trust set forth on"
"7470","Schedule A attached hereto (each a Fund, and"
"7471","collectively, the Funds), as such Schedule may be"
"7472","amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto;"
"7473","and"
"7474","       WHEREAS, the Adviser, with the approval of the"
"7475","Trust, desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to provide"
"7476","investment advisory services to the Adviser in"
"7477","connection with the management of a Fund, and the"
"7478","Sub-Adviser is willing to render such investment"
"7479","advisory services."
"7480","       NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as"
"7481","follows:"
"7482","1.	Duties of the Sub-Adviser.  Subject to"
"7483","supervision by the Adviser and the Trusts"
"7484","Board of Trustees, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"7485","manage all of the securities and other assets"
"7486","of each Fund entrusted to it hereunder (the"
"7487","Assets), including the purchase, retention and"
"7488","disposition of the Assets, in accordance with"
"7489","the Funds investment objectives, policies and"
"7490","restrictions as stated in each Funds"
"7491","prospectus and statement of additional"
"7492","information, as currently in effect and as"
"7493","amended or supplemented from time to time"
"7494","(referred to collectively as the Prospectus),"
"7495","and subject to the following:"
"7496","(a)	The Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the"
"7497","direction of the Adviser, determine from time"
"7498","to time what Assets will be purchased,"
"7499","retained or sold by a Fund, and what portion"
"7500","of the Assets will be invested or held"
"7501","uninvested in cash."
"7502","(b)	In the performance of its duties and"
"7503","obligations under this Agreement, the Sub-"
"7504","Adviser shall act in conformity with the"
"7505","Trusts Declaration of Trust (as defined"
"7506","herein) and the Prospectus and with the"
"7507","instructions and directions of the Adviser and"
"7508","of the Board of Trustees of the Trust and will"
"7509","conform to and comply with the requirements of"
"7510","the 1940 Act, the Internal Revenue Code of"
"7511","1986 (the Code), and all other applicable"
"7512","federal and state laws and regulations, as"
"7513","each is amended from time to time."
"7514","(c)	The Sub-Adviser shall determine the Assets to"
"7515","be purchased, held or sold by a Fund as"
"7516","provided in subparagraph (a) and will place"
"7517","orders with or through such persons, brokers"
"7518","or dealers to carry out the policy with"
"7519","respect to brokerage set forth in a Funds"
"7520","Prospectus or as the Board of Trustees or the"
"7521","Adviser may direct from time to time, in"
"7522","conformity with all applicable federal"
"7523","securities laws.  In executing Fund"
"7524","transactions and selecting brokers or dealers,"
"7525","the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to"
"7526","seek on behalf of each Fund the best overall"
"7527","terms available.  In assessing the best"
"7528","overall terms available for any transaction,"
"7529","the Sub-Adviser shall consider all factors"
"7530","that it deems relevant, including the breadth"
"7531","of the market in the security, the price of"
"7532","the security, the financial condition and"
"7533","execution capability of the broker or dealer,"
"7534","and the reasonableness of the commission, if"
"7535","any, both for the specific transaction and on"
"7536","a continuing basis.  In evaluating the best"
"7537","overall terms available, and in selecting the"
"7538","broker-dealer to execute a particular"
"7539","transaction, the Sub-Adviser may also consider"
"7540","the brokerage and research services provided"
"7541","(as those terms are defined in Section 28(e)"
"7542","of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as"
"7543","amended (the Exchange Act)).  Consistent with"
"7544","any guidelines established by the Board of"
"7545","Trustees of the Trust and Section 28(e) of the"
"7546","Exchange Act, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to"
"7547","pay to a broker or dealer who provides such"
"7548","brokerage and research services a commission"
"7549","for executing a portfolio transaction for a"
"7550","Fund which is in excess of the amount of"
"7551","commission another broker or dealer would have"
"7552","charged for effecting that transaction if, but"
"7553","only if, the Sub-Adviser determines in good"
"7554","faith that such commission was reasonable in"
"7555","relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"7556","research services provided by such broker or"
"7557","dealer -- viewed in terms of that particular"
"7558","transaction or in terms of the overall"
"7559","responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to its"
"7560","discretionary clients, including a Fund.  In"
"7561","addition, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to"
"7562","allocate purchase and sale orders for"
"7563","securities to brokers or dealers (including"
"7564","brokers and dealers that are affiliated with"
"7565","the Adviser, Sub-Adviser or the Trusts"
"7566","principal underwriter) if the Sub-Adviser"
"7567","believes that the quality of the transaction"
"7568","and the commission are comparable to what they"
"7569","would be with other qualified firms.  In no"
"7570","instance, however, will a Funds Assets be"
"7571","purchased from or sold to the Adviser, Sub-"
"7572","Adviser, the Trusts principal underwriter, or"
"7573","any affiliated person of any of the Trust,"
"7574","Adviser, the Sub-Adviser or the principal"
"7575","underwriter, acting as principal in the"
"7576","transaction, except to the extent permitted by"
"7577","the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)"
"7578","and the 1940 Act."
"7579","(d)	The Sub-Adviser shall maintain all books and"
"7580","records with respect to transactions involving"
"7581","the Assets required by subparagraphs (b)(5),"
"7582","(6), (7), (9), (10) and (11) and paragraph (f)"
"7583","of Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act.  The Sub-"
"7584","Adviser shall keep the books and records"
"7585","relating to the Assets required to be"
"7586","maintained by the Sub-Adviser under this"
"7587","Agreement and shall timely furnish to the"
"7588","Adviser all information relating to the Sub-"
"7589","Advisers services under this Agreement needed"
"7590","by the Adviser to keep the other books and"
"7591","records of a Fund required by Rule 31a-1 under"
"7592","the 1940 Act.  The Sub-Adviser agrees that all"
"7593","records that it maintains on behalf of a Fund"
"7594","are property of the Fund and the Sub-Adviser"
"7595","will surrender promptly to a Fund any of such"
"7596","records upon the Funds request; provided,"
"7597","however, that the Sub-Adviser may retain a"
"7598","copy of such records.  In addition, for the"
"7599","duration of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser"
"7600","shall preserve for the periods prescribed by"

"7602","as are required to be maintained by it"
"7603","pursuant to this Agreement, and shall transfer"
"7604","said records to any successor sub-adviser upon"
"7605","the termination of this Agreement (or, if"
"7606","there is no successor sub-adviser, to the"
"7607","Adviser)."
"7608","(e)	The Sub-Adviser shall provide a Funds"
"7609","custodian on each business day with"
"7610","information relating to all transactions"
"7611","concerning a Funds Assets and shall provide"
"7612","the Adviser with such information upon request"
"7613","of the Adviser."
"7614","(f)	To the extent called for by the Trusts"
"7615","Compliance Policies and Procedures, or as"
"7616","reasonably requested by a Fund, the Sub-"
"7617","Adviser shall provide the Fund with"
"7618","information and advice regarding Assets to"
"7619","assist the Fund in determining the appropriate"
"7620","valuation of such Assets."

"7622","the Sub-Adviser under this Agreement are not"
"7623","to be deemed exclusive and the Sub-Adviser"
"7624","shall be free to render similar services to"
"7625","others, as long as such services do not impair"
"7626","the services rendered to the Adviser or the"
"7627","Trust."
"7628","(h)	The Sub-Adviser shall promptly notify the"
"7629","Adviser of any financial condition that is"
"7630","reasonably likely to impair the Sub-Advisers"
"7631","ability to fulfill its commitment under this"
"7632","Agreement."
"7633","(i)	(i)	Except under the circumstances set forth"
"7634","in subsection (ii), the Sub-Adviser"
"7635","shall not be responsible for reviewing"
"7636","proxy solicitation materials or voting"
"7637","and handling proxies,  in relation to"
"7638","the securities held as Assets in a Fund."
"7639","If the Sub-Adviser receives a"
"7640","misdirected proxy it shall promptly"

"7642","Adviser."
"7643","(ii)	The Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that upon"
"7644","60 days written notice from the Adviser,"
"7645","the Sub-Adviser shall assume"
"7646","responsibility for reviewing proxy"
"7647","solicitation materials and voting such"
"7648","materials in relation to the securities"
"7649","held as Assets in a Fund.  As of the"
"7650","time the Sub-Adviser shall assume such"
"7651","responsibilities with respect to such"
"7652","material under this sub-section (ii),"
"7653","the Adviser shall instruct the custodian"
"7654","and other parties providing services to"
"7655","a Fund to promptly forward misdirected"
"7656","proxies to the Sub-Adviser."
"7657","(iii)	The Sub-Adviser shall not have any"
"7658","obligation to initiate or otherwise act"
"7659","on behalf of a Fund with respect to"
"7660","class-action proceedings."
"7661","Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon"
"7662","reasonable request of the Adviser, the"
"7663","Sub-Adviser will provide relevant"
"7664","information and/or documentation"
"7665","relating to such class-action"
"7666","proceedings."
"7667","(j)	In performance of its duties and obligations"
"7668","under this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"7669","not consult with any other sub-adviser to a"
"7670","Fund or a sub-adviser to a portfolio that is"
"7671","under common control with a Fund concerning"
"7672","the Assets, except as permitted by the"
"7673","policies and procedures of a Fund.  The Sub-"
"7674","Adviser shall not provide investment advice to"
"7675","any assets of a Fund other than the Assets."
"7676","(k)	On occasions when the Sub-Adviser deems the"
"7677","purchase or sale of a security to be in the"
"7678","best interest of a Fund as well as other"
"7679","clients of the Sub-Adviser, the Sub-Adviser"
"7680","may, to the extent permitted by applicable law"
"7681","and regulations, aggregate the order for"
"7682","securities to be sold or purchased.  In such"
"7683","event, the Sub-Adviser will allocate"
"7684","securities so purchased or sold, as well as"
"7685","the expenses incurred in the transaction, in a"
"7686","manner the Sub-Adviser reasonably considers to"
"7687","be equitable and consistent with its fiduciary"
"7688","obligations to a Fund and to such other"
"7689","clients under the circumstances."
"7690","(l)	The Sub-Adviser shall also furnish to the"
"7691","Adviser or the Board of Trustees such periodic"
"7692","reports and information with regard to its"
"7693","affairs as the Adviser or Board of Trustees"
"7694","may reasonably request.  The Sub-Adviser shall"

"7701","rules adopted thereunder) or any exemptive or"
"7702","other relief that the Adviser or the Trust"
"7703","obtains from the SEC."
"7704","(m)	The Sub-Adviser may use persons employed by an"
"7705","affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act)"
"7706","of the Sub-Adviser, each of whom shall be"
"7707","treated as a supervised person of the Sub-"

"7721","whatsoever by any use of such supervised"

"8362","information, as currently in effect and as"
"8363","amended or supplemented from time to time"
"8364","(referred to collectively as the"
"8365","Prospectus), and subject to the following:"
"8366","(a)	The Sub-Adviser shall, in consultation"
"8367","with and subject to the direction of the"
"8368","Adviser, determine from time to time what"
"8369","Assets will be purchased, retained or"
"8370","sold by the Portfolio, and what portion"
"8371","of the Assets will be invested or held"
"8372","uninvested in cash."
"8373","(b)	In the performance of its duties and"
"8374","obligations under this Agreement, the"
"8375","Sub-Adviser shall act in conformity with"
"8376","the Trusts Declaration of Trust (as"
"8377","defined herein) and the Prospectus and"
"8378","with the instructions and directions of"
"8379","the Adviser and of the Board of Trustees"

"8394","herein) and Prospectus or as the Board"
"8395","of Trustees or the Adviser may direct"
"8396","from time to time, in conformity with"
"8397","federal securities laws. In executing"
"8398","Portfolio transactions and selecting"
"8399","brokers or dealers, the Sub-Adviser will"
"8400","use its best efforts to seek on behalf"
"8401","of the Portfolio the best overall terms"
"8402","available. In"
"8403","assessing the best overall terms"
"8404","available for any transaction, the Sub-"
"8405","Adviser shall consider all factors that"
"8406","it deems relevant, including the breadth"
"8407","of the market in the security, the"
"8408","price of the security, the financial"
"8409","condition and execution capability of"
"8410","the broker or dealer, and the"
"8411","reasonableness of the commission, if"
"8412","any, both for the specific transaction"
"8413","and on a continuing basis. In evaluating"
"8414","the best overall terms available, and in"
"8415","selecting the"
"8416","broker-dealer to execute a particular"
"8417","transaction, the Sub-Adviser may also"
"8418","consider the brokerage and research"
"8419","services provided (as those terms are"
"8420","defmed in Section 28(e) of the Securities"
"8421","Exchange Act of 1934). Consistent with any"
"8422","guidelines established by the Board of"
"8423","Trustees of the Trust, the Sub-Adviser is"
"8424","authorized to pay to a broker or dealer who"
"8425","provides such brokerage and research"
"8426","services a commission for executing a"
"8427","portfolio transaction for the Portfolio"
"8428","which is in excess of the amount of"
"8429","commission another broker or dealer would"
"8430","have charged for effecting that transaction"
"8431","if, but only if, the Sub-Adviser determines"
"8432","in good faith that such commission was"
"8433","reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"8434","brokerage and research services provided by"
"8435","such broker or dealer -- viewed in terms of"
"8436","that particular transaction or terms of the"
"8437","overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser"
"8438","to the Portfolio. Inaddition, the Sub-"
"8439","Adviser is authorized to allocate purchase"

"8441","or dealers (including brokers and dealers"
"8442","that are affiliated with the Adviser, Sub-"
"8443","Adviser or the Trusf s principal"
"8444","underwriter) if the Sub-Adviser believes"
"8445","that the quality of the transaction and the"
"8446","commission are comparable to what they"
"8447","would be  with other qualified frrms. Inno"
"8448","instance, however, will the Portfolios"
"8449","Assets be purchased from or sold to the"
"8450","Adviser, Sub-Adviser, the Trusts principal"
"8451","underwriter, or any affiliated person of"
"8452","either the Trust, Adviser, the Sub-Adviser"

"8814","SEI INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS TRUST"
"8815","       AGREEMENT made as of this _30__ day of June,"
"8816","2014 between SEI Investments Management Corporation"
"8817","(the Adviser) and Causeway Capital Management LLC"
"8818","(the Sub-Adviser)."
"8819","       WHEREAS, SEI Institutional Investments Trust,"
"8820","a Massachusetts business trust (the Trust), is"
"8821","registered as an open-end management investment"
"8822","company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as"
"8823","amended (the 1940 Act); and"
"8824","       WHEREAS, the Adviser has entered into an"
"8825","Investment Advisory Agreement dated June 14, 1996,"
"8826","as amended, (the Advisory Agreement) with the Trust,"
"8827","pursuant to which the Adviser acts as investment"
"8828","adviser to each series of the Trust set forth on"
"8829","Schedule A attached hereto (each a Fund, and"
"8830","collectively, the Funds), as such Schedule may be"
"8831","amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto;"
"8832","and"
"8833","       WHEREAS, the Adviser, with the approval of the"
"8834","Trust, desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to provide"
"8835","investment advisory services to the Adviser in"
"8836","connection with the management of a Fund, and the"
"8837","Sub-Adviser is willing to render such investment"
"8838","advisory services."
"8839","       NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as"
"8840","follows:"
"8841","1.	Duties of the Sub-Adviser.  Subject to"
"8842","supervision by the Adviser and the Trusts"
"8843","Board of Trustees, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"8844","manage all of the securities and other assets"
"8845","of each Fund entrusted to it hereunder (the"
"8846","Assets), including the purchase, retention and"
"8847","disposition of the Assets, in accordance with"
"8848","the Funds investment objectives, policies and"
"8849","restrictions as stated in each Funds"
"8850","prospectus and statement of additional"
"8851","information, as currently in effect and as"
"8852","amended or supplemented from time to time"
"8853","(referred to collectively as the Prospectus),"
"8854","and subject to the following:"
"8855","(a)	The Sub-Adviser shall (in consultation"
"8856","with the Adviser from time to time, as"
"8857","necessary) determine from time to time"
"8858","what Assets will be purchased, retained"
"8859","or sold by a Fund, and what portion of"
"8860","the Assets will be invested or held"
"8861","uninvested in cash."
"8862","(b)	In the performance of its duties and"
"8863","obligations under this Agreement, the"
"8864","Sub-Adviser shall act in conformity with"
"8865","the Trusts Declaration of Trust (as"
"8866","defined herein), Prospectus, Compliance"
"8867","Policies and Procedures and with the"
"8868","instructions and directions of the"
"8869","Adviser and of the Board of Trustees of"
"8870","the Trust and will conform to and comply"
"8871","with the requirements of the 1940 Act,"
"8872","the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the"
"8873","Code), and all other applicable federal"
"8874","and state laws and regulations, as each"
"8875","is amended from time to time."
"8876","(c)	  	The Sub-Adviser shall determine the"
"8877","Assets to be purchased or sold by a Fund as"
"8878","provided in subparagraph (a) and will"
"8879","place orders with or through such"
"8880","persons, brokers or dealers to carry out"
"8881","the policy with respect to brokerage set"
"8882","forth in a Funds Prospectus or as the"
"8883","Board of Trustees or the Adviser may"
"8884","direct from time to time, in conformity"
"8885","with all federal securities laws.  In"
"8886","executing Fund transactions and"
"8887","selecting brokers or dealers, the Sub-"
"8888","Adviser will use its best efforts to"
"8889","seek on behalf of each Fund the best"
"8890","overall terms available.  In assessing"
"8891","the best overall terms available for any"
"8892","transaction, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"8893","consider all factors that it deems"
"8894","relevant, including the breadth of the"
"8895","market in the security, the price of the"
"8896","security, the financial condition and"
"8897","execution capability of the broker or"
"8898","dealer, and the reasonableness of the"
"8899","commission, if any, both for the"
"8900","specific transaction and on a continuing"
"8901","basis.  In evaluating the best overall"
"8902","terms available, and in selecting the"
"8903","broker-dealer to execute a particular"
"8904","transaction, the Sub-Adviser may also"
"8905","consider the brokerage and research"
"8906","services provided (as those terms are"
"8907","defined in Section 28(e) of the"
"8908","Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the"
"8909","Exchange Act)).  Consistent with any"
"8910","guidelines established by the Board of"
"8911","Trustees of the Trust and Section 28(e)"
"8912","of the Exchange Act, the Sub-Adviser is"
"8913","authorized to pay to a broker or dealer"
"8914","who provides such brokerage and research"
"8915","services a commission for executing a"
"8916","portfolio transaction for a Fund which"
"8917","is in excess of the amount of commission"
"8918","another broker or dealer would have"
"8919","charged for effecting that transaction"
"8920","if, but only if, the Sub-Adviser"
"8921","determines in good faith that such"
"8922","commission was reasonable in relation to"
"8923","the value of the brokerage and research"
"8924","services provided by such broker or"
"8925","dealer -- viewed in terms of that"
"8926","particular transaction or in terms of"
"8927","the overall responsibilities of the Sub-"
"8928","Adviser to its discretionary clients,"
"8929","including a Fund.  In addition, the Sub-"
"8930","Adviser is authorized to allocate"
"8931","purchase and sale orders for securities"
"8932","to brokers or dealers (including brokers"
"8933","and dealers that are affiliated with the"
"8934","Adviser, Sub-Adviser or the Trusts"
"8935","principal underwriter) if the Sub-"
"8936","Adviser believes that the quality of the"
"8937","transaction and the commission are"
"8938","comparable to what they would be with"
"8939","other qualified firms.  In no instance,"
"8940","however, will a Funds Assets be"
"8941","purchased from or sold to the Adviser,"
"8942","Sub-Adviser, the Trusts principal"
"8943","underwriter, or any affiliated person of"
"8944","either the Trust, Adviser, the Sub-"
"8945","Adviser or the principal underwriter,"
"8946","acting as principal in the transaction,"
"8947","except to the extent permitted by the"
"8948","Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)"
"8949","and the 1940 Act."
"8950","(d)	The Sub-Adviser shall maintain all books"
"8951","and records with respect to transactions"
"8952","involving the Assets required by"
"8953","subparagraphs (b)(5), (6), (7), (9),"
"8954","(10) and (11) and paragraph (f) of Rule"
"8955","31a-1 under the 1940 Act.  The Sub-"
"8956","Adviser shall keep the books and records"
"8957","relating to the Assets required to be"
"8958","maintained by the Sub-Adviser under this"
"8959","Agreement and shall timely furnish to"
"8960","the Adviser all information relating to"
"8961","the Sub-Advisers services under this"
"8962","Agreement needed by the Adviser to keep"
"8963","the other books and records of a Fund"
"8964","required by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940"
"8965","Act.  The Sub-Adviser agrees that all"
"8966","records that it maintains on behalf of a"
"8967","Fund are also property of the Fund and"
"8968","the Sub-Adviser will surrender promptly"
"8969","to a Fund any of such records upon the"
"8970","Funds request; provided, however, that"
"8971","the Sub-Adviser may retain a copy of"
"8972","such records (or the original if"
"8973","required by Rule 204-2 of the Advisers"
"8974","Act).  In addition, for the duration of"
"8975","this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"8976","preserve for the periods prescribed by"
"8977","Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any such"
"8978","records as are required to be maintained"
"8979","by it pursuant to this Agreement, and"
"8980","shall transfer said records to the Fund"
"8981","upon the termination of this Agreement"
"8982","upon request."
"8983","(e)	The Sub-Adviser shall provide a Funds"
"8984","custodian on each business day with"
"8985","information relating to all transactions"
"8986","concerning a Funds Assets and shall"
"8987","provide the Adviser with such"
"8988","information upon request of the Adviser."
"8989","(f)	To the extent called for by the Trusts"
"8990","Compliance Policies and Procedures, or"
"8991","as reasonably requested by a Fund, the"
"8992","Sub-Adviser shall provide the Fund with"
"8993","information and advice regarding Assets"
"8994","to assist the Fund in determining the"
"8995","appropriate valuation of such Assets."
"8996","(g)	The investment management services"
"8997","provided by the Sub-Adviser under this"
"8998","Agreement are not to be deemed exclusive"
"8999","and the Sub-Adviser shall be free to"
"9000","render similar services to others, as"
"9001","long as such services do not impair the"
"9002","services rendered to the Adviser or the"
"9003","Trust."
"9004","(h)	The Sub-Adviser shall promptly notify"
"9005","the Adviser of any financial condition"
"9006","that is reasonably likely to impair the"
"9007","Sub-Advisers ability to fulfill its"
"9008","commitment under this Agreement."
"9009","(i)	(i)	Except under the circumstances set"
"9010","forth in subsection (ii), the Sub-"
"9011","Adviser shall not be responsible"
"9012","for reviewing proxy solicitation"
"9013","materials or voting and handling"
"9014","proxies in relation to the"
"9015","securities held as Assets in a"
"9016","Fund.  If the Sub-Adviser receives"
"9017","a misdirected proxy, it shall"
"9018","promptly forward such misdirected"
"9019","proxy to the Adviser."
"9020","(ii)	The Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that"
"9021","upon 60 days written notice from"
"9022","the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"9023","assume responsibility for"
"9024","reviewing proxy solicitation"
"9025","materials and voting proxies in"
"9026","relation to the securities held as"
"9027","Assets in a Fund.  As of the time"
"9028","the Sub-Adviser shall assume such"
"9029","responsibilities with respect to"
"9030","proxies under this sub-section"
"9031","(ii), the Adviser shall instruct"
"9032","the custodian and other parties"
"9033","providing services to a Fund to"
"9034","promptly forward misdirected"
"9035","proxies to the Sub-Adviser."
"9036","(j)	In performance of its duties and"
"9037","obligations under this Agreement, the"
"9038","Sub-Adviser shall not consult with any"
"9039","other sub-adviser to a Fund or a sub-"
"9040","adviser to a portfolio that is under"
"9041","common control with a Fund concerning"
"9042","the Assets, except as permitted by the"
"9043","policies and procedures of a Fund.  The"
"9044","Sub-Adviser shall not provide investment"
"9045","advice to any assets of a Fund other"
"9046","than the Assets."
"9047","(k)	On occasions when the Sub-Adviser deems"
"9048","the purchase or sale of a security to be"
"9049","in the best interest of a Fund as well"
"9050","as other clients of the Sub-Adviser, the"
"9051","Sub-Adviser may, to the extent permitted"
"9052","by applicable law and regulations,"
"9053","aggregate the order for securities to be"
"9054","sold or purchased.  In such event, the"
"9055","Sub-Adviser will allocate securities so"
"9056","purchased or sold, as well as the"
"9057","expenses incurred in the transaction, in"
"9058","a manner the Sub-Adviser reasonably"
"9059","considers to be equitable and consistent"
"9060","with its fiduciary obligations to a Fund"
"9061","and to such other clients under the"
"9062","circumstances."
"9063","(l)	The Sub-Adviser shall provide to the"
"9064","Adviser or the Board of Trustees such"
"9065","periodic and special reports, balance"
"9066","sheets or financial information, and"

"9076","adopted thereunder) or any exemptive or"
"9077","other relief that the Adviser or the"
"9078","Trust obtains from the SEC."
"9079","	To the extent permitted by law, the services"
"9080","to be furnished by the Sub-Adviser under this"
"9081","Agreement may be furnished through the medium"
"9082","of any of the Sub-Advisers partners, officers,"
"9083","employees or control affiliates; provided,"
"9084","however, that the use of such mediums does not"
"9085","relieve the Sub-Adviser from any obligation or"
"9086","duty under this Agreement."
"9087","2.	Duties of the Adviser.  The Adviser shall"
"9088","continue to have responsibility for all"
"9089","services to be provided to each Fund pursuant"
"9090","to the Advisory Agreement and shall oversee"
"9091","and review the Sub-Advisers performance of its"
"9092","duties under this Agreement; provided,"
"9093","however, that in connection with its"
"9094","management of the Assets, nothing herein shall"
"9095","be construed to relieve the Sub-Adviser of"
"9096","responsibility for compliance with the Trusts"
"9097","Declaration of Trust (as defined herein),"
"9098","Prospectus, Compliance Policies and"
"9099","Procedures, the instructions and directions of"

"9104","to time."
"9105","3.	Delivery of Documents.  The Adviser has"

"9107","of the following documents:"
"9108","(a)	The Trusts Agreement and Declaration of"
"9109","Trust, as filed with the Secretary of State of"
"9110","the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (such"

"9124","agrees to accept as full compensation"
"9125","therefor, a sub-advisory fee at the rate"
"9126","specified in Schedule B which is attached"
"9127","hereto and made part of this Agreement.  The"
"9128","fee will be calculated based on the average"
"9129","daily value of the Assets, excluding cash with"

"9131","under the Sub-Advisers management and will be"
"9132","paid to the Sub-Adviser monthly.  For the"
"9133","avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the fact"

"9135","fee will be accrued under this Agreement with"
"9136","respect to any day that the value of the"
"9137","Assets under the Sub-Advisers management"
"9138","equals zero.  Except as may otherwise be"
"9139","prohibited by law or regulation (including any"
"9140","then current SEC staff interpretation), the"

"9507","as amended, (the Advisory Agreement) with the Trust,"
"9508","pursuant to which the Adviser acts as investment"

"9514","       WHEREAS, the Adviser, with the approval of the"
"9515","Trust, desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to provide"
"9516","investment advisory services to the Adviser in"
"9517","connection with the management of a Fund, and the"
"9518","Sub-Adviser is willing to render such investment"
"9519","advisory services."
"9520","       NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as"
"9521","follows:"
"9522","1.	Duties of the Sub-Adviser.  Subject to"
"9523","supervision by the Adviser and the Trusts"
"9524","Board of Trustees, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"9525","manage all of the securities and other assets"
"9526","of each Fund entrusted to it hereunder (the"
"9527","Assets), including the purchase, retention and"
"9528","disposition of the Assets, in accordance with"
"9529","the Funds investment objectives, policies and"
"9530","restrictions as stated in each Funds"
"9531","prospectus and statement of additional"
"9532","information, as currently in effect and as"
"9533","amended or supplemented from time to time"
"9534","(referred to collectively as the Prospectus),"
"9535","and subject to the following:"
"9536","(a)	The Sub-Adviser shall, in consultation"
"9537","with and subject to the direction of the"
"9538","Adviser, determine from time to time"
"9539","what Assets will be purchased, retained"
"9540","or sold by a Fund, and what portion of"
"9541","the Assets will be invested or held"
"9542","uninvested in cash."
"9543","(b)	In the performance of its duties and"
"9544","obligations under this Agreement, the"
"9545","Sub-Adviser shall act in conformity with"
"9546","the Trusts Declaration of Trust (as"
"9547","defined herein), Prospectus, Compliance"
"9548","Policies and Procedures and with the"
"9549","instructions and directions of the"
"9550","Adviser and of the Board of Trustees of"
"9551","the Trust and will conform to and comply"
"9552","with the requirements of the 1940 Act,"
"9553","the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the"
"9554","Code), and all other applicable federal"
"9555","and state laws and regulations, as each"
"9556","is amended from time to time."
"9557","(c)	The Sub-Adviser shall determine the Assets"
"9558","to be purchased or sold by a Fund as"
"9559","provided in subparagraph (a) and will"
"9560","place orders with or through such"
"9561","persons, brokers or dealers to carry out"
"9562","the policy with respect to brokerage set"
"9563","forth in a Funds Prospectus or as the"
"9564","Board of Trustees or the Adviser may"
"9565","direct from time to time, in conformity"
"9566","with all federal securities laws.  In"
"9567","executing Fund transactions and"
"9568","selecting brokers or dealers, the Sub-"
"9569","Adviser will use its best efforts to"
"9570","seek on behalf of each Fund the best"
"9571","overall terms available.  In assessing"
"9572","the best overall terms available for any"
"9573","transaction, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"9574","consider all factors that it deems"
"9575","relevant, including the breadth of the"
"9576","market in the security, the price of the"
"9577","security, the financial condition and"
"9578","execution capability of the broker or"
"9579","dealer, and the reasonableness of the"
"9580","commission, if any, both for the"
"9581","specific transaction and on a continuing"
"9582","basis.  In evaluating the best overall"
"9583","terms available, and in selecting the"
"9584","broker-dealer to execute a particular"
"9585","transaction, the Sub-Adviser may also"
"9586","consider the brokerage and research"
"9587","services provided (as those terms are"
"9588","defined in Section 28(e) of the"
"9589","Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the"
"9590","Exchange Act)).  Consistent with any"
"9591","guidelines established by the Board of"
"9592","Trustees of the Trust and Section 28(e)"
"9593","of the Exchange Act, the Sub-Adviser is"
"9594","authorized to pay to a broker or dealer"
"9595","who provides such brokerage and research"
"9596","services a commission for executing a"
"9597","portfolio transaction for a Fund which"
"9598","is in excess of the amount of commission"
"9599","another broker or dealer would have"
"9600","charged for effecting that transaction"
"9601","if, but only if, the Sub-Adviser"
"9602","determines in good faith that such"
"9603","commission was reasonable in relation to"
"9604","the value of the brokerage and research"
"9605","services provided by such broker or"
"9606","dealer -- viewed in terms of that"
"9607","particular transaction or in terms of"
"9608","the overall responsibilities of the Sub-"
"9609","Adviser to its discretionary clients,"
"9610","including a Fund.  In addition, the Sub-"
"9611","Adviser is authorized to allocate"
"9612","purchase and sale orders for securities"
"9613","to brokers or dealers (including brokers"
"9614","and dealers that are affiliated with the"
"9615","Adviser, Sub-Adviser or the Trusts"
"9616","principal underwriter) if the Sub-"
"9617","Adviser believes that the quality of the"
"9618","transaction and the commission are"
"9619","comparable to what they would be with"
"9620","other qualified firms.  In no instance,"
"9621","however, will a Funds Assets be"
"9622","purchased from or sold to the Adviser,"
"9623","Sub-Adviser, the Trusts principal"
"9624","underwriter, or any affiliated person of"
"9625","either the Trust, Adviser, the Sub-"
"9626","Adviser or the principal underwriter,"
"9627","acting as principal in the transaction,"
"9628","except to the extent permitted by the"
"9629","Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)"
"9630","and the 1940 Act."
"9631","(d)	The Sub-Adviser shall maintain all books"
"9632","and records with respect to transactions"
"9633","involving the Assets required by"
"9634","subparagraphs (b)(5), (6), (7), (9),"
"9635","(10) and (11) and paragraph (f) of Rule"
"9636","31a-1 under the 1940 Act.  The Sub-"
"9637","Adviser shall keep the books and records"
"9638","relating to the Assets required to be"
"9639","maintained by the Sub-Adviser under this"
"9640","Agreement and shall timely furnish to"
"9641","the Adviser all information relating to"
"9642","the Sub-Advisers services under this"
"9643","Agreement needed by the Adviser to keep"
"9644","the other books and records of a Fund"
"9645","required by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940"
"9646","Act.  The Sub-Adviser agrees that all"
"9647","records that it maintains on behalf of a"
"9648","Fund are property of the Fund and the"
"9649","Sub-Adviser will surrender promptly to a"
"9650","Fund any of such records upon the Funds"
"9651","request; provided, however, that the"
"9652","Sub-Adviser may retain a copy of such"
"9653","records.  In addition, for the duration"
"9654","of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"9655","preserve for the periods prescribed by"
"9656","Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any such"
"9657","records as are required to be maintained"
"9658","by it pursuant to this Agreement, and"
"9659","shall transfer said records to any"
"9660","successor sub-adviser upon the"
"9661","termination of this Agreement (or, if"
"9662","there is no successor sub-adviser, to"
"9663","the Adviser)."
"9664","(e)	The Sub-Adviser shall provide a Funds"
"9665","custodian on each business day with"
"9666","information relating to all transactions"
"9667","concerning a Funds Assets and shall"
"9668","provide the Adviser with such"
"9669","information upon request of the Adviser."
"9670","(f)  	To the extent called for by the Trusts"
"9671","Compliance Policies and Procedures, or as"
"9672","reasonably requested by a Fund, the Sub-"
"9673","Adviser shall provide the Fund with"
"9674","information and advice regarding Assets"
"9675","to assist the Fund in determining the"
"9676","appropriate valuation of such Assets."
"9677","(g)	The investment management services"
"9678","provided by the Sub-Adviser under this"
"9679","Agreement are not to be deemed exclusive"
"9680","and the Sub-Adviser shall be free to"
"9681","render similar services to others, as"
"9682","long as such services do not impair the"
"9683","services rendered to the Adviser or the"
"9684","Trust."
"9685","(h)	The Sub-Adviser shall promptly notify"
"9686","the Adviser of any financial condition"
"9687","that is reasonably likely to impair the"
"9688","Sub-Advisers ability to fulfill its"
"9689","commitment under this Agreement."
"9690","(i)	(i)	Except under the circumstances set"
"9691","forth in subsection (ii), the Sub-"
"9692","Adviser shall not be responsible"
"9693","for reviewing proxy solicitation"
"9694","materials or voting and handling"
"9695","proxies in relation to the"

"9698","a misdirected proxy, it shall"

"10303","another broker or dealer would have"
"10304","charged for effecting that transaction"
"10305","if, but only if, the Sub-Adviser"
"10306","determines in good faith that such"
"10307","commission was reasonable in relation to"

"10918","time what Assets will be purchased,"
"10919","retained or sold by a Fund, and what"

"10947","direct from time to time, in conformity"
"10948","with all federal securities laws In"
"10949","executing Fund transactions and selecting"
"10950","brokers or dealers, the Sub-Adviser will"

"10953","available. In assessing the best overall"
"10954","terms available for any transaction, the"
"10955","Sub-Adviser shall consider all factors"
"10956","that it deems relevant, including the"
"10957","breadth of the market in the security,"
"10958","the price of the security, the"
"10959","financial condition and execution"
"10960","capability of the broker or dealer, and"
"10961","the reasonableness of the commission, if"
"10962","any, both for the specific transaction and"
"10963","on a continuing basis. In evaluating the"
"10964","best overall terms available, and in"
"10965","selecting the broker-dealer to execute a"
"10966","particular transaction, the Sub-Adviser"
"10967","may also consider the brokerage and"
"10968","research services provided (as those terms"
"10969","are defined in Section 28(e) of the"
"10970","Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the"

"10977","services a commission for executing a"
"10978","portfolio transaction for a Fund which is"
"10979","in excess of the amount of commission"
"10980","another broker or dealer would have"
"10981","charged for effecting that transaction if,"
"10982","but only if, the Sub-Adviser determines"
"10983","in good faith that such commission was"
"10984","reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"10985","brokerage and research services provided"
"10986","by such broker or dealer -- viewed in"
"10987","terms of that particular transaction or"
"10988","in terms of the overall responsibilities"
"10989","of the Sub-Adviser to its discretionary"
"10990","clients, including a Fund. In addition, the"
"10991","Sub-Adviser is authorized to allocate"
"10992","purchase and sale orders for securities to"
"10993","brokers or dealers (including brokers and"
"10994","dealers that are affiliated with the"

"10996","principal underwriter) if the Sub-Adviser"
"10997","believes that the quality of the"
"10998","transaction and the commission are"
"10999","comparable to what they would be with"
"11000","other qualified firms. In no instance,"
"11001","however, will a Funds Assets be"
"11002","purchased from or sold to the Adviser,"
"11003","Sub-Adviser, the Trusts principal"
"11004","underwriter, or any affiliated person of"
"11005","either the Trust, Adviser, the Sub-Adviser"
"11006","or the principal underwriter, acting as"
"11007","principal in the transaction, except to"

"11014","and (11) and paragraph (f) of Rule 3la-1"

"11053","with information  and advice  regarding"
"11054","Assets  to  assist the Fund  in"
"11055","determining  the appropriate valuation of"

"11060","and the Sub-Adviser shall be free to"
"11061","render similar services to others, as"
"11062","long as such services do not impair  the"
"11063","services rendered to the Adviser or the"

"11065","(h)	The Sub-Adviser shall promptly notify the"
"11066","Adviser of any financial condition that"

"11654","obligations under this Agreement, the"
"11655","Sub Adviser shall act in conformity"
"11656","with the Trusts Declaration of Trust"
"11657","(as defined herein), Prospectus,"

"11687","any transaction,  the  Sub Adviser"

"11711","dealer  who provides  such brokerage"
"11712","and research services a commission for"

"11715","amount of commission another broker or"
"11716","dealer would have  charged  for"
"11717","effecting  that  transaction  if,  but"
"11718","only  if,  the  Sub Adviser determines"
"11719","in good faith that such commission was"
"11720","reasonable in relation to the value of"
"11721","the brokerage and research services"
"11722","provided by such broker or dealer"
"11723","viewed  in  terms  of  that"
"11724","particular  transaction   or  in"
"11725","terms  of  the  overall"
"11726","responsibilities of the Sub Adviser to"
"11727","its discretionary clients, including a"

"11736","of the  transaction  and  the"

"12424","(c)	The Sub-Adviser shall determine the"

"12433","from time to time, in"
"12434","conformity with all federal securities"
"12435","laws. In executing Fund transactions"
"12436","and selecting brokers or dealers, the"
"12437","Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts"
"12438","to seek on behalf of each Fund the"
"12439","best overall terms available. In"
"12440","assessing the best overall terms"
"12441","available for"
"12442","any transaction, the Sub-Adviser shall"
"12443","consider all factors that it deems"
"12444","relevant, including the breadth of the"
"12445","market in the security, the price of"
"12446","the security, the financial condition"
"12447","and execution capability of the broker"
"12448","or dealer, and the reasonableness of"
"12449","the commission, ifany, both for the"
"12450","specific transaction and on a"
"12451","continuing basis.  In"
"12452","evaluating the best overall terms"
"12453","available, and in selecting the broker-"
"12454","dealer to execute a particular"
"12455","transaction, the Sub-Adviser may also"
"12456","consider the brokerage and research"
"12457","services provided (as those terms are"
"12458","defmed in Section 28(e) of the"
"12459","Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the"

"12461","guidelines established by the Board of"
"12462","Trustees of the Trust and Section 28(e)"
"12463","of the Exchange Act, the Sub-Adviser is"
"12464","authorized to pay to a broker or dealer"
"12465","who provides such brokerage and"
"12466","research"
"12467","services a commission for executing a"
"12468","portfolio transaction for a Fund which"
"12469","is in excess of the amount of"
"12470","commission another broker or dealer"
"12471","would have charged for effecting that"
"12472","transaction if, but only if, the Sub-"
"12473","Adviser determines in good faith that"
"12474","such commission was reasonable in"
"12475","relation to the value of the brokerage"
"12476","and research services provided by"
"12477","such broker or dealer -viewed in"
"12478","terms of that particular transaction"
"12479","or in terms of the overall"
"12480","responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to"
"12481","its discretionary clients, including a"
"12482","Fund.  In addition, the Sub-Adviser"
"12483","is authorized to allocate purchase and"
"12484","sale orders for securities to brokers"
"12485","or dealers (including brokers and"
"12486","dealers that are affiliated with the"
"12487","Adviser, Sub-Adviser or the Trusts"
"12488","principal underwriter)  if the Sub-"
"12489","Adviser believes that the quality of"
"12490","the transaction and the commission are"
"12491","comparable to what they would be with"
"12492","other qualified firms.  In no"
"12493","instance, however, will a Funds Assets"
"12494","be purchased  from or sold to the"
"12495","Adviser,  Sub-Adviser, the Trusts"
"12496","principal underwriter, or any"
"12497","affiliated person of either the Trust,"

"12501","to the extent permitted by the"
"12502","Securities and Exchange Commission"
"12503","(SEC) and the  1940 Act."
"12504","(d)	The Sub-Adviser shall maintain all"
