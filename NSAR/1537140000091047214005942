"444","Marathon Value Portfolio"
"445","and"

"454","Northern Lights Fund"
"455","Trust III, as of and for the"

"457","2014 in accordance with"
"458","the standards of the Public"
"459","Company Accounting"
"460","Oversight Board United"
"461","States we considered the"
"462","Fund's internal control"
"463","over financial reporting"
"464","including controls over"
"465","safeguarding securities as"
"466","a basis for designing our"
"467","auditing procedures for"
"468","the purpose of expressing"
"469","our opinion on the"
"470","financial statements and to"
"471","comply with the"
"472","requirements of Form"
"473","NSAR but not for the"
"474","purpose of expressing an"
"475","opinion on the"
"476","effectiveness of the"
"477","Fund's internal control"
"478","over financial reporting."
"479","Accordingly we express"
"480","no such opinion."
"481","The management of the"
"482","Fund is responsible for"
"483","establishing and"
"484","maintaining effective"
"485","internal control over"
"486","financial reporting.  In"
"487","fulfilling this"
"488","responsibility estimates"
"489","and judgments by"
"490","management are required"
"491","to assess the expected"
"492","benefits and related costs"
"493","of controls.  A funds"
"494","internal control over"
"495","financial reporting is a"
"496","process designed to"
"497","provide reasonable"
"498","assurance regarding the"
"499","reliability of financial"
"500","reporting and the"
"501","preparation of financial"
"502","statements for external"
"503","purposes in accordance"
"504","with generally accepted"
"505","accounting principles"
"506","GAAP.  A funds internal"
"507","control over financial"
"508","reporting includes those"
"509","policies and procedures"
"510","that (1) pertain to the"
"511","maintenance of records"
"512","that, in reasonable detail"
"513","accurately and fairly"
"514","reflect the transactions and"
"515","dispositions of the assets"
"516","of the fund (2) provide"
"517","reasonable assurance that"
"518","transactions are recorded"
"519","as necessary to permit"
"520","preparation of financial"
"521","statements in accordance"
"522","with GAAP and that"
"523","receipts and expenditures"
"524","of the fund are being made"
"525","only in accordance with"

"533","acquisition use or"
"534","disposition of a funds"
"535","assets that could have a"
"536","material effect on the"
"537","financial statements."
"538","Because of its inherent"
"539","limitations internal control"
"540","over financial reporting"
"541","may not prevent or detect"
"542","misstatements.  Also"
"543","projections of any"
"544","evaluation of effectiveness"
"545","to future periods are"
"546","subject to the risk that"
"547","controls may become"
"548","inadequate because of"
"549","changes in conditions or"
"550","that the degree of"
"551","compliance with the"
"552","policies or procedures"
"553","may deteriorate."
"554","A deficiency in internal"
"555","control over financial"
"556","reporting exists when the"
"557","design or operation of a"
"558","control does not allow"
"559","management or employees"
"560","in the normal course of"
"561","performing their assigned"
"562","functions to prevent or"
"563","detect misstatements on a"
"564","timely basis.  A material"
"565","weakness is a deficiency"
"566","or combination of"
"567","deficiencies in internal"
"568","control over financial"
"569","reporting such that there is"
"570","a reasonable possibility"
"571","that a material"
"572","misstatement of the Funds"
"573","annual or interim financial"
"574","statements will not be"
"575","prevented or detected on a"
"576","timely basis."
"577","Our consideration of the"
"578","Funds internal control"
"579","over financial reporting"
"580","was for the limited"
"581","purpose described in the"
"582","first paragraph and would"
"583","not necessarily disclose all"
"584","deficiencies in internal"
"585","control that might be"
"586","material weaknesses under"
"587","standards established by"
"588","the Public Company"
"589","Accounting Oversight"
"590","Board (United States)."
"591","However, we noted no"
"592","deficiencies in the Funds"
"593","internal control over"
"594","financial reporting and its"
"595","operation, including"
"596","controls over safeguarding"
"597","securities that we consider"
"598","to be a material weakness"
"599","as defined above as of"
"600","October 31 2014."
"601","This report is intended"
