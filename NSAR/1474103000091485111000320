"830","To the prospectuses dated February 28, 2011"
"831","The following text replaces the section of each funds prospectus titled"
"832","Exchanging shares:"
"833","Exchanging shares"
"834","Generally You may exchange shares of the fund for the same class of shares"
"835"," of other funds sold by the distributor. For investors who qualify as"
"836","Clients of Eligible Financial Intermediaries and participate in Eligible"
"837","Investment Programs made available through their financial intermediaries"
"838","(such as investors in fee-based advisory or mutual fund wrap programs),"

"840","of the same fund under certain limited circumstances. Please refer to the"
"841","section of this prospectus titled Retirement and Institutional Investors"
"842","eligible investors or contact your financial intermediary for more"
"843","information. An exchange of shares of one fund for shares of another"
"844","fund is considered a sale and generally results in a capital gain or"
"845","loss for federal income tax purposes, unless you are investing through"
"846","an IRA, 401(k) or other tax-advantaged account. An exchange of shares of"
"847","one class directly for shares of another class of the same fund normally"
"848","should not be taxable for federal income tax purposes. You should talk to"
"849","your tax advisor before making an exchange. The exchange privilege is not"
"850","intended as a vehicle for short-term trading. The fund may suspend or"
"851","terminate your exchange privilege if you engage in a pattern of excessive"
"852","exchanges."
"853","Legg Mason offers a distinctive family of funds tailored to help meet the"
"854","varying needs of large and small investors"

"875","charge or a contingent deferred sales charge at the time of the exchange"
"876","Your contingent deferred sales charge (if any) will continue to be measured"
"877","from the date of your original purchase of shares subject to a contingent"
"878","deferred sales charge,and you will be subject to the contingent deferred"
"879","sales charge of the fund that you originally purchased"

"919","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"920","To the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Global Asset Management Trust and"
"921","Shareholders of Legg Mason Capital Management Disciplined Equity Research"
"922","Fund and Legg Mason BW Absolute Return Opportunities Fund:"
"923","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Legg"
"924","Mason Capital Management Disciplined Equity Research Fund and Legg Mason BW"
"925","Absolute Return Opportunities Fund (two of the funds comprising Legg Mason"
"926","Global Asset Management Trust, the Company) as of and for the period ended"
"927","October 31, 2011, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"928","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Company's"
"929","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"930","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"931","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"932","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"933","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control"
"934","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"935","effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting."
"936","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and"
"937","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"938","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"939","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"940","company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"941","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"942","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"943","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"944","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"945","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"946","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"947","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"948","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"949","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"950","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"951","only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"952","company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"953","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"954","company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"955","statements."
"956","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"957","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any"
"958","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"959","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"960","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"961","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"962","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"963","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"964","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"965","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"966","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"967","material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial"
"968","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"969","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over financial reporting"
"970","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"971","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"972","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"973","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we"
"974","noted no deficiencies in the Company's internal control over financial"
"975","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities"
"976","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of October"
"977","31, 2011."
"978","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"979","the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Global Asset Management Trust and the"
"980","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not"
"981","be used by anyone other than these specified parties."
