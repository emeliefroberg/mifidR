"504","(United States), we"

"514","for the purpose of"

"525","Fund's internal"
"526","control over financial"

"528","Accordingly, we"
"529","express no such"

"531","The management of"
"532","the Fund is"
"533","responsible for"
"534","establishing and"
"535","maintaining effective"
"536","internal control over"
"537","financial reporting. In"
"538","fulfilling this"
"539","responsibility,"
"540","estimates and"
"541","judgments by"
"542","management are"
"543","required to assess"
"544","the expected"
"545","benefits and related"
"546","costs of controls. A"
"547","fund's internal"
"548","control over financial"
"549","reporting is a"
"550","process designed to"
"551","provide reasonable"
"552","assurance regarding"
"553","the reliability of"
"554","financial reporting"
"555","and the preparation"
"556","of financial"
"557","statements for"
"558","external purposes in"
"559","accordance with"
"560","generally accepted"
"561","accounting principles"
"562","(GAAP). A fund's"
"563","internal control over"
"564","financial reporting"
"565","includes those"
"566","policies and"
"567","procedures that (a)"
"568","pertain to the"
"569","maintenance of"
"570","records that, in"
"571","reasonable detail,"
"572","accurately and fairly"
"573","reflect the"
"574","transactions and"
"575","dispositions of the"
"576","assets of the fund;"
"577","(b) provide"
"578","reasonable"
"579","assurance that"
"580","transactions are"
"581","recorded as"
"582","necessary to permit"
"583","preparation of"
"584","financial statements"
"585","in accordance with"
"586","GAAP, and that"
"587","receipts and"
"588","expenditures of the"
"589","fund are being made"
"590","only in accordance"
"591","with authorizations"
"592","of management and"
"593","directors of the fund;"
"594","and (c) provide"
"595","reasonable"
"596","assurance regarding"
"597","prevention or timely"
"598","detection of"
"599","unauthorized"
"600","acquisition, use or"
"601","disposition of a"
"602","fund's assets that"
"603","could have a"
"604","material effect on the"
"605","financial statements."
"606","Because of inherent"
"607","limitations, internal"
"608","control over financial"
"609","reporting may not"
"610","prevent or detect"
"611","misstatements. Also,"
"612","projections of"
"613","effectiveness to"
"614","future periods are"
"615","subject to the risk"
"616","that controls may"
"617","become inadequate"
"618","because of changes"
"619","in conditions, or that"
"620","the degree of"
"621","compliance with the"
"622","policies or"
"623","procedures may"
"624","deteriorate."
"625","A deficiency in"
"626","internal control over"
"627","financial reporting"
"628","exists when the"
"629","design or operation"
"630","of a control does not"
"631","allow management"
"632","or employees, in the"
"633","normal course of"
"634","performing their"
"635","assigned functions,"
"636","to prevent or detect"
"637","misstatements on a"
"638","timely basis. A"
"639","material weakness is"
"640","a deficiency, or"
"641","combination of"
"642","deficiencies, in"
"643","internal control over"
"644","financial reporting,"
"645","such that there is a"
"646","reasonable"
"647","possibility that a"
"648","material"
"649","misstatement of the"
"650","Fund's annual or"
"651","interim financial"
"652","statements will not"
"653","be prevented or"
"654","detected on a timely"
"655","basis."
"656","Our consideration of"
"657","the Fund's internal"
"658","control over financial"
"659","reporting was for the"
"660","limited purpose"
"661","described in the first"
"662","paragraph and"
"663","would not"
"664","necessarily identify"
"665","all deficiencies in"
"666","internal control that"
"667","might be material"
"668","weaknesses under"
"669","standards"
"670","established by the"
"671","Public Company"
"672","Accounting"
"673","Oversight Board"
"674","(United States)."
"675","However, we noted"
"676","no deficiencies in the"
"677","Fund's internal"
"678","control over financial"
"679","reporting and its"
"680","operation, including"
"681","controls over"
"682","safeguarding of"
"683","securities that we"
"684","consider to be a"
"685","material weakness"
"686","as defined above as"
"687","of June 30, 2015."
"688","This report is"
