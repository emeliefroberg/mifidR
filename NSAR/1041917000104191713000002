"626","<TEXT>"
"627","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"628","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders"
"629","of Cohen & Steers Realty Income Fund, Inc."
"630","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Cohen &"
"631","Steers Realty Income Fund, Inc. (the Fund) as of and for the year ended"
"632","December  31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"633","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"634","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"635","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"
"636","of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"637","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"638","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"639","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"640","internal control over financial reporting."
"641","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"642","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"643","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"644","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"645","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"646","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"647","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"648","accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"649","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"650","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"651","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"652","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"653","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"654","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"655","fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"656","directors of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"657","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"658","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"659","statements."
"660","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"661","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"662","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"663","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"664","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"665","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"666","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"667","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"668","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"669","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"670","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"671","the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"672","detected on a timely basis."
"673","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"674","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"675","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"676","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"677","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"678","no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial reporting and"
"679","its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we"
"680","consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of December 31, 2012."
"681","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"682","the Board of Directors of Cohen & Steers Realty Income Fund, Inc. and the"
"683","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"
"684","used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"695","<TEXT>"
"696","Item 77(D) - Effective September 19, 2012, the Board of Directors approved"
"697","the Fund's investments in mortgage- and asset-backed securities."
"698","Mortgage-backed securities are mortgage-related securities issued or"
"699","guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, or"
"700","issued by non-government entities. Mortgage related securities represent pools"
"701","of mortgage loans assembled for sale to investors by various government"
"702","agencies, as well as by non-government issuers such as commercial banks,"
"703","savings and loan institutions, mortgage bankers and private mortgage insurance"
"704","companies. Although certain mortgage-related securities are guaranteed by a"
"705","third party or otherwise similarly secured, the market value of the security,"
"706","which may fluctuate, is not guaranteed."
"707","Other asset-backed securities are structured like mortgage-backed securities,"
"708","but instead of mortgage loans or interests in mortgage loans, the underlying"
"709","assets may include such items as motor vehicle installment sales or"
"710","installment loan contracts, leases of various types of real and personal"
"711","property, and receivables from credit card agreements and from sales of"
"712","personal property. Regular payments received in respect of such securities"
"713","include both interest and principal. Asset-backed securities typically have no"
"714","U.S. Government backing. Additionally, the ability of an issuer of"
"715","asset-backed securities to enforce its security interest in the underlying"
"716","assets may be limited."
"717","If a Fund purchases a mortgage-backed or other asset-backed security at a"
"718","premium, that portion may be lost if there is a decline in the market value of"
"719","the security whether resulting from changes in interest rates or prepayments"
"720","in the underlying collateral. As with other interest-bearing securities, the"
"721","prices of such securities are inversely affected by changes in interest rates."
"722","Although the value of a mortgage-backed or other asset-backed security may"
"723","decline when interest rates rise, the converse is not necessarily true, since"
"724","in periods of declining interest rates the mortgages and loans underlying the"
"725","securities are prone to prepayment, thereby shortening the average life of the"
"726","security and shortening the period of time over which income at the higher"
"727","rate is received. When interest rates are rising, the rate of prepayment tends"
"728","to decrease, thereby lengthening the period of time over which income at the"
"729","lower rate is received. For these and other reasons, a mortgage-backed or"
"730","other asset-backed security's average maturity may be shortened or lengthened"
"731","as a result of interest rate fluctuations and, therefore, it is not possible"
"732","to predict accurately the security's return."
