"4573","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"4574","American Century Asset Allocation Portfolios, Inc.:"
"4575","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of American"
"4576","Century Asset Allocation Portfolios, Inc. (the Corporation), including One"

"4582","LIVESTRONG 2045 Portfolio, LIVESTRONG 2050 Portfolio, and LIVESTRONG 2055"
"4583","Portfolio, as of and for the year ended July 31, 2011, in accordance with"
"4584","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"4585","(United States), we considered the Corporation's internal control over"
"4586","financial reporting, including control over safeguarding securities, as"
"4587","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"4588","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"4589","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"4590","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control"
"4591","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"4592","The management of the Corporation is responsible for establishing and"
"4593","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"4594","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"4595","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"4596","controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"4597","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"4598","of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"4599","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"4600","A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"4601","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"4602","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"4603","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"4604","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"4605","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"4606","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being"
"4607","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors"
"4608","of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"4609","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a"
"4610","company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"4611","statements."
"4612","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"4613","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"4614","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"4615","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"4616","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"4617","procedures may deteriorate."
"4618","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"4619","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"4620","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"4621","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness"
"4622","is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"4623","over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"4624","that a material misstatement of the Corporation's annual or interim"
"4625","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"4626","basis."
"4627","Our consideration of the Corporation's internal control over financial"
"4628","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"4629","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"4630","that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"4631","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"4632","we noted no deficiencies in the Corporation's internal control over"
"4633","financial reporting and its operation, including controls for"
"4634","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness,"
"4635","as defined above, as of July 31, 2011.This report is intended solely"
"4636","for the information and use of management and the Board of Directors"
"4637","of American Century Asset Allocation Portfolios, Inc. and the"
"4638","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and"
"4639","should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"4660","(b) LiveSTRONG 2055 Portfolio, a new series of the Registrant, began offering"
"4661","Investor, Institutional, A, C and R Classes during the period, effective"
"4662","03/31/11."
"4663","Each fund is a series of shares issued by the corporation, and shares of"
"4664","each fund have equal voting rights. In addition, each series (or fund)"
"4665","may be divided into separate classes. Additional funds and classes may"
"4666","be added without a shareholder vote."
"4667","Each fund votes separately on matters affecting that fund exclusively."
"4668","Voting rights are not cumulative, so investors holding more than 50% of"
"4669","the corporation's (all funds') outstanding shares may be able to elect"
"4670","a Board of Directors. The corporation undertakes dollar-based voting,"
"4671","meaning that the number of votes a shareholder is entitled to is based"
"4672","upon the dollar amount of the shareholder's investment. The election of"
"4673","directors is determined by the votes received from all of the corporation's"
"4674","shareholders without regard to whether a majority of shares of any one fund"
"4675","voted in favor of a particular nominee or all nominees as a group."
"4676","Each shareholder has rights to dividends and distributions declared by the"
"4677","fund he or she owns and to the net assets of such fund upon its liquidation"
"4678","or dissolution proportionate to his or her share ownership interest in the"
"4679","fund."
"4680","The assets belonging to each series are held separately by the custodian and"
"4681","the shares of each series or class represent a beneficial interest in the"
"4682","principal, earnings and profit (or losses) of investments and other assets"
"4683","held for each series or class. Within their respective series or class, all"
"4684","shares have equal redemption rights. Each share, when issued, is fully paid"
"4685","and non-assessable."
"4686","The A, C and R Class shares of the fund are made available to participants"
"4687","in employer-sponsored retirement plans and to persons purchasing through"
"4688","broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries"
"4689","that provide various administrative, shareholder and distribution services."
"4690","The fund's distributor enters into contracts with various banks, broker-dealers,"
"4691","insurance companies and other financial intermediaries, with respect to the"
"4692","sale of the fund's shares and/or the use of the fund's shares in various"
"4693","investment products or in connection with various financial services."
"4694","Certain recordkeeping and administrative services that would otherwise be"
"4695","performed by the fund's transfer agent may be performed by a plan sponsor"
"4696","(or its agents) or by a financial intermediary for A, C and R Class"
"4697","investors. In addition to such services, the financial intermediaries"
"4698","provide various individual shareholder and distribution services."
"4699","To enable the fund's shares to be made available through such plans and"
"4700","financial intermediaries, and to compensate them for such services, the"
"4701","fund's Board of Directors has adopted the A Class, C Class and R Class"
"4702","Plans. Pursuant to the plans, the following fees are paid and described"
"4703","further below."
"4704","The A Class pays the fund's distributor 0.25% annually of the average"
"4705","daily net asset value of the A Class shares. The distributor may use"
"4706","these fees to pay for certain ongoing shareholder and administrative"
"4707","services and for distribution services, including past distribution"
"4708","services. This payment is fixed at 0.25% and is not based on expenses"
"4709","incurred by the distributor."
"4710","The C Class pays the fund's distributor 1.00% annually of the average"
"4711","daily net asset value of the fund's C Class shares, 0.25% of which is"
"4712","paid for certain ongoing individual shareholder and administrative"
"4713","services and 0.75% of which is paid for distribution services, including"
"4714","past distribution services. This payment is fixed at 1.00% and is not"
"4715","based on expenses incurred by the distributor."
"4716","The R Class pays the fund's distributor 0.50% annually of the average"
"4717","daily net asset value of the R Class shares. The distributor may use"
"4718","these fees to pay for certain ongoing shareholder and administrative"
"4719","services and for distribution services, including past distribution"
"4720","services. This payment is fixed at 0.50% and is not based on expenses"
"4721","incurred by the distributor."
"4722","The distributor then makes these payments to the financial"
"4723","intermediaries (including underwriters and broker-dealers, who may use"
"4724","some of the proceeds to compensate sales personnel) who offer the A, C"
"4725","and R Class shares for the services described below. No portion of these"
"4726","payments is used by the distributor to pay for advertising, printing costs"
"4727","or interest expenses."
"4728","Payments may be made for a variety of individual shareholder services,"
"4729","including, but not limited to:"
"4730","(a)"

"4752","Distribution services include any activity undertaken or expense"

"4798","accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act."
"4799","Your ability to purchase, exchange, redeem and transfer shares will be"
"4800","affected by the policies of the financial intermediary through which you"
"4801","do business. Some policy differences may include"
"4802",".."
"4803","minimum investment requirements"

"4809","cutoff"

"4811",".."
"4812","trading restrictions"
"4813","In addition, your financial intermediary may charge a transaction fee"
"4814","for the purchase or sale of fund shares. Those charges are retained by"
"4815","the financial intermediary and are not shared with American Century"
"4816","Investments or the fund. Please contact your financial intermediary or"
"4817","plan sponsor for a complete description of its policies. Copies of the"
"4818","fund's annual report, semiannual report and statement of additional"
"4819","information are available from your financial intermediary or plan"
"4820","sponsor."
"4821","The fund has authorized certain financial intermediaries to accept orders"
"4822","on the fund's behalf. American Century Investments has selling agreements"
"4823","with these financial intermediaries requiring them to track the time"
"4824","investment orders are received and to comply with procedures relating"
"4825","to the transmission of orders. Orders must be received by the financial"
"4826","intermediary on the fund's behalf before the time the net asset value is"
"4827","determined in order to receive that day's share price. If those orders"
"4828","are transmitted to American Century Investments and paid for in accordance"
"4829","with the selling agreement, they will be priced at the net asset value next"
"4830","determined after your request is received in the form required by the"
"4831","financial intermediary."
"4832","Unless otherwise specified below, the minimum initial investment amount"
"4833","to open an account is $2,500. However, American Century Investments will"
"4834","waive the fund minimum if you make an initial investment of at least $500"
"4835","and continue to make automatic investments of at least $100 a month until"
"4836","reaching the fund minimum."
"4837","Financial intermediaries may open an account with $250, but may require"
"4838","their clients to meet different investment minimums."
"4839","Broker-dealer sponsored wrap program accounts and/or"
"4840","fee-based advisory accounts 				No minimum"
"4841","Coverdell Education Savings Account			$2,000(1)(2)"
"4842","Employer-sponsored retirement plans(3)			No minimum"
"4843","1"
"4844"," American Century Investments will waive the minimum if you make an"
"4845","initial investment of at least $500 and continue to make automatic"
"4846","investments of at least $100 a month until reaching the minimum."
"4847","2"
"4848","The minimum initial investment for shareholders investing through"
"4849","financial intermediaries is $250. Financial intermediaries may have"
"4850","different minimums for their clients."
"4851","3"
"4852","For this purpose, employer-sponsored retirement plans do not include"
"4853","SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs or SARSEPs."
"4854","There is a $50 minimum for subsequent purchases. However, there is no subsequent"
"4855","purchase minimum for financial intermediaries or employer-sponsored retirement"
"4856","plans, but financial intermediaries may require their clients to meet different"
"4857","subsequent purchase requirements."
"4858","The Institutional Class shares are made available for purchase by individuals"
"4859","and large institutional shareholders such as bank trust departments,"
"4860","corporations, retirement plans, endowments, foundations and financial advisors"
"4861","that meet the fund's minimum investment requirements. Institutional Class"
"4862","shares are not available for purchase by insurance companies for variable"
"4863","annuity and variable life products."
"4864","The minimum initial investment amount for Institutional Class shares is"
"4865","$5 million ($3 million for endowments and foundations) per fund. If you"
"4866","invest with us through a financial intermediary, this requirement may be"
"4867","met if your financial intermediary aggregates your investments with those"
"4868","of other clients into a single group, or omnibus, account that meets the"
"4869","minimum. The minimum investment requirement may be waived if you, or your"
"4870","financial intermediary if you invest through an omnibus account, have an"
"4871","aggregate investment in our family of funds of $10 million or more"
"4872","($5 million for endowments and foundations), or in other situations as"
"4873","determined by American Century Investments. In addition, financial"
"4874","intermediaries or plan recordkeepers may require retirement plans to"
"4875","meet certain other conditions, such as plan size or a minimum level"
"4876","of assets per participant, in order to be eligible to purchase"
"4877","Institutional Class shares."
"4878","If you sell C or, in certain cases, A Class shares, you may pay a sales charge,"
"4879","depending on how long you have held your shares. Your redemption proceeds will"
"4880","be calculated using the net asset value (NAV) next determined after we receive"
"4881","your transaction request in good order."
"4882","A fund's net asset value, or NAV, is the price of the fund's shares."
"4883","However, we reserve the right to delay delivery of redemption proceeds"
"4884","up to seven days. For example, each time you make an investment with"
"4885","American Century Investments, there is a seven-day holding period before"
"4886","we will release redemption proceeds from those shares, unless you provide"
"4887","us with satisfactory proof that your purchase funds have cleared."
"4888","Investments by wire generally require only a one-day holding period."
"4889","If you change your address, we may require that any redemption"
"4890","request made within 15 days be submitted in writing and be signed by"
"4891","all authorized signers with their signatures guaranteed. If you change"
"4892","your bank information, we may impose a 15-day holding period before"
"4893","we will transfer or wire redemption proceeds to your bank. Please remember,"
"4894","if you request redemptions by wire, $10 will be deducted from the amount"
"4895","redeemed. Your bank also may charge a fee."
"4896","In addition, we reserve the right to honor certain redemptions with securities,"
"4897","rather than cash."
"4898","If, during any 90-day period, you redeem fund shares worth more than $250,000"
"4899","(or 1% of the value of a fund's assets if that amount is less than $250,000),"
"4900","we reserve the right to pay part or all of the redemption proceeds in excess"
"4901","of this amount in readily marketable securities instead of in cash. The"
"4902","portfolio managers would select these securities from the fund's portfolio."
"4903","We will value these securities in the same manner as we do in computing the"
"4904","fund's net asset value. We may provide these securities in lieu of cash"
"4905","without prior notice. Also, if payment is made in securities, you may have"
"4906","to pay brokerage or other transaction costs to convert the securities to cash."
"4907","If your redemption would exceed this limit and you would like to avoid being"
"4908","paid in securities, please provide us with an unconditional instruction to"
"4909","redeem at least 15 days prior to the date on which the redemption transaction"
"4910","is to occur. The instruction must specify the dollar amount or number of"
"4911","shares to be redeemed and the date of the transaction. This minimizes the"
"4912","effect of the redemption on a fund and its remaining investors."
"4913","If your account balance falls below the minimum initial investment amount"
"4914","for any reason, or if you cancel your automatic monthly investment plan"
"4915","prior to reaching the fund minimum, American Century Investments reserves"
"4916","the right to redeem the shares in the account and send the proceeds to your"
"4917","address of record.  Prior to doing so, we will notify you and give you"
"4918","60 days to meet the minimum or reinstate your automatic monthly investment"
"4919","plan. Please note that A and C Class shares redeemed in this manner may be"
"4920","subject to a sales charge if held less than the applicable time period."
"4921","You also may incur tax liability as a result of the redemption. For"
"4922","Institutional Class shares, we reserve the right to convert your shares"
"4923","to Investor Class shares of the same fund. The total annual operating"
"4924","expenses of Investor Class shares are 0.20% higher than Institutional"
"4925","Class shares."
"4926","Within 90 days of a redemption of any A or B Class shares, you may reinvest"
"4927","all of the redemption proceeds in A Class shares of any American Century"
"4928","Investments fund at the then-current net asset value without paying an"
"4929","initial sales charge. At your request, any CDSC you paid on an A Class"
"4930","redemption that you are reinvesting will be credited to your account."
"4931","You or your financial professional must notify the fund's transfer"
"4932","agent in writing at the time of the reinvestment to take advantage"
"4933","of this privilege, and you may use it only once per account. This"
"4934","privilege applies only if the new account is owned by the original"
"4935","account owner."
"4936","You may exchange shares of the fund for shares of the same class of"
"4937","another American Century Investments fund without a sales charge if"
"4938","you meet the following criteria:"
"4939",".."
"4940","The exchange is for a minimum of $100"
"4941",".."
"4942","For an exchange that opens"
"4943","a new account, the amount of the exchange must meet or exceed the"
"4944","minimum account size requirement for the fund receiving the exchange"
"4945","For purposes of computing any applicable CDSC on shares that have been"
"4946","exchanged, the holding period will begin as of the date of purchase of"
"4947","the original fund owned. Exchanges from a money market fund are subject"
"4948","to a sales charge on the fund being purchased, unless the money market"
"4949","fund shares were acquired by exchange from a fund with a sales charge"
"4950","or by reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions."
"4951","A signature guarantee - which is different from a notarized signature -"
"4952","is a warranty that the signature presented is genuine. We may require"
"4953","a signature guarantee for the following transactions."
"4954",".."
"4955","You have chosen to conduct business in writing only and would like to"
"4956","redeem over $100,000."
"4957",".."
"4958","Your redemption or distribution check or automatic"
"4959","redemption is made payable to someone other than the account owners."
"4960",".."
"4961","Your redemption proceeds or distribution amount is sent by EFT"
"4962","(ACH or wire) to a destination other than your personal bank account."
"4963",".."
"4964","You are transferring ownership of an account over $100,000."
"4965",".."
"4966","You change your address and request a redemption over $100,000"
"4967","within 15 days."
"4968","We reserve the right to require a signature guarantee for other transactions,"
"4969","at our discretion."
"4970","Transaction instructions are irrevocable. That means that once you have mailed"
"4971","or otherwise transmitted your transaction instruction, you may not modify or"
"4972","cancel it. The fund reserves the right to suspend the offering of shares for"
"4973","a period of time and to reject any specific investment (including a purchase"
"4974","by exchange). Additionally, we may refuse a purchase if, in our judgment,"
"4975","it is of a size that would disrupt the management of the fund."
"4976","We reserve the right to change any stated investment requirement, including"
"4977","those that relate to purchases, exchanges and redemptions. We also may alter,"
"4978","add or discontinue any service or privilege. Changes may affect all investors"
"4979","or only those in certain classes or groups. In addition, from time to time"
"4980","we may waive a policy on a case-by-case basis, as the advisor deems"
"4981","appropriate."
