"5991","<TEXT>"
"5992","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"5993","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of SunAmerica Focused"
"5994","Series, Inc.:"
"5995","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements"
"5996","of each of the eighteen funds constituting SunAmerica Focused Series,"
"5997","Inc., (hereafter referred to as the Funds) as of and for the year"
"5998","ended October 31, 2009, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"5999","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"6000","Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"6001","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"6002","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"6003","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"6004","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"6005","Funds' internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"6006","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"6007","control over financial reporting."
"6008","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"6009","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"6010","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"6011","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"6012","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"6013","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"6014","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"6015","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"6016","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"6017","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"6018","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"6019","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"6020","Funds; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"6021","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"6022","with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"6023","expenditures of the Funds are being made only in accordance with"
"6024","authorizations of management and directors of the Funds; and (3)"
"6025","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"6026","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets"
"6027","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"6028","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"6029","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"6030","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"6031","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"6032","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"6033","procedures may deteriorate."
"6034","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"6035","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"6036","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"6037","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"6038","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"6039","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"6040","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual or"
"6041","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"6042","timely basis."
"6043","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"6044","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"6045","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"6046","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"6047","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"6048","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal"
"6049","control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"6050","over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses"
"6051","as defined above as of October 31, 2009."

"6268","Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, will conform in"
"6269","all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933"
"6270","and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder"
"6271","(the 1933 Act) and will not contain any untrue statement of a"
"6272","material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated"
"6273","therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading."
"6274","	The Subadviser also represents and warrants that in furnishing"
"6275","services hereunder, the Subadviser will not consult with any other"
"6276","subadviser to a Fund to the extent any other subadvisers are engaged"
"6277","by the Adviser, or any other subadvisers to other investment companies"
"6278","that are under common control with the Corporation, concerning"
"6279","transactions of the Fund in securities or other assets, other than for"
"6280","purposes of complying with the conditions of paragraphs (a) and"
"6281","(b) of rule 12d3-1 under the Act."
"6282","	The Subadviser accepts such employment and agrees, at its"
"6283","own expense, to render the services set forth herein and to provide"
"6284","the office space, furnishings, equipment and personnel required by"
"6285","it to perform such services on the terms and for the compensation"
"6286","provided in this Agreement."
"6287","	(b) The Subadviser agrees: (i) to maintain a level of errors"
"6288","and omissions or professional liability insurance coverage that, at"
"6289","all times during the course of this Agreement, is appropriate given the"
"6290","nature of its business; and (ii) from time to time and upon reasonable"
"6291","request, to supply evidence of such coverage to the Adviser."
"6292","	2.	Fund Transactions.  (a) The Subadviser is responsible"
"6293","for: (i) decisions, and is hereby authorized, to buy or sell securities"
"6294","and other investments for a Fund or a portion of the Fund's assets"
"6295","allotted to it, (ii) selection of broker-dealers and futures commission"
"6296","merchants' and (iii) negotiation of brokerage commission and futures"
"6297","commission merchants' rates.  As a general matter, in executing Fund"
"6298","transactions, the Subadviser may employ or deal with such broker-dealers"
"6299","or futures commission merchants as may, in the Subadviser's best"
"6300","judgment,provide prompt and reliable execution of the transactions at"
"6301","favorable prices and reasonable commission rates.  In selecting such"
"6302","broker-dealers or futures commission merchants, the Subadviser shall"
"6303","consider all relevant factors including price (including the applicable"
"6304","brokerage commission, dealer spread or futures commission merchant"
"6305","rate), the size of the order, the nature of the"
"6306","market for the security or other investment, the timing of the"
"6307","transaction, the reputation, experience and financial stability of"
"6308","the broker-dealer or futures commission merchant involved, the quality"
"6309","of the service, the difficulty of execution, the execution"
"6310","capabilities and operational facilities of the firm involved, and, in"
"6311","the case of securities,  the firm's risk in positioning a block of"
"6312","securities.  Consistent with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange"
"6313","Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act), the Subadviser shall not be"
"6314","deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created"
"6315","by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of the Subadviser's"
"6316","having caused a Fund to pay a member of an exchange, broker or dealer"
"6317","an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction in"
"6318","excess of the amount of commission another member of an exchange,"
"6319","broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that"
"6320","transaction, if the Subadviser determines in good faith that such"
"6321","amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"6322","brokerage and research services provided by such member of an"
"6323","exchange, broker or dealer viewed in terms of either that particular"
"6324","transaction or the Subadviser's overall responsibilities with respect"
"6325","to the Fund and to other clients as to which the Subadviser exercises"
"6326","investment discretion.  In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934"
"6327","Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder, and subject to any other applicable"
"6328","laws and regulations including Section 17(e) of the Act"
"6329","and Rule 17e-1 thereunder, the Subadviser may engage its"
"6330","affiliates, the Adviser and its affiliates or any other subadviser to"
"6331","the Fund and its respective affiliates, as broker-dealers or futures"
"6332","commission merchants to effect Fund transactions in"
"6333","securities and other investments for the Fund.  The Subadviser will"
"6334","promptly communicate to the Adviser and to the officers and the"
"6335","Directors of the Corporation such information relating to Fund"
"6336","transactions as they may reasonably request, including but not"
"6337","limited to, reports, if available, prepared by independent third"
"6338","parties relating to the execution costs of such transactions.  To"
"6339","the extent consistent with applicable law, the Subadviser may aggregate"
"6340","purchase or sell orders for a Fund with contemporaneous"
"6341","purchase or sell orders of other clients of the Subadviser or its"
"6342","affiliated persons.  In such event, allocation of the securities so"
"6343","purchased or sold, as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction,"
"6344","will be made by the Subadviser in the manner the"
"6345","Subadviser determines to be equitable and consistent with its and"
"6346","its affiliates' fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to such"
"6347","other clients.  The Adviser hereby acknowledges that such aggregation"
"6348","of orders may not result in more favorable pricing or"
"6349","lower brokerage commissions in all instances."
"6350","	(b)	Notwithstanding Section 2(a) above, for such purposes"
"6351","as obtaining investment research products and services for the Fund,"
"6352","covering fees paid by the Fund and other expenses of the Fund, the"
"6353","Adviser may request the Subadviser to effect a specific percentage of"
"6354","the transactions in securities and other investments it effects on"
"6355","behalf of a Fund with certain broker-dealers and futures commission"
"6356","merchants.  In requesting the use of a particular broker-dealer or"
"6357","futures commission merchant, the Adviser and Subadviser acknowledge"
"6358","and agree that all brokerage transactions are subject to best"
"6359","execution.  As such, Subadviser agrees, subject to its best execution"
"6360","obligations, to direct transactions to a particular broker-dealer or"
"6361","futures commission merchant designated by the Adviser.  Adviser"
"6362","acknowledges that Subadviser may be unable to fulfill the Adviser's"
"6363","request for direction for a number of reasons, including, but not"
"6364","limited to: 1) such direction would be inconsistent with"
"6365","Subadviser's internal policies and procedures related to best"
"6366","execution; 2) such direction may result in the Subadviser paying a"
"6367","higher commission, depending upon the"
"6368","Subadviser's arrangements with the particular broker-dealer or"
"6369","futures commission merchant, etc; 3) if the Subadviser directs"
"6370","payments of an excessive amount of commissions, the executions may"
"6371","not be accomplished as rapidly; 4) the Subadviser may forfeit the"
"6372","possible advantage derived from the aggregation of multiple orders"
"6373","as a single bunched transaction where Subadviser would, in some"
"6374","instances, be in a better position to negotiate commissions; or 5)"
"6375","Subadviser does not make commitments to allocate fixed or"
"6376","definite amounts of commissions to brokers."
"6377","	3.	Compensation of the Subadviser.  The Subadviser"
"6378","shall not be entitled to receive any payment from the Corporation"
"6379","or a Fund and shall look solely and exclusively to the Adviser for"
"6380","payment of all fees for the services rendered, facilities furnished"
"6381","and expenses paid by it hereunder.  As compensation for the"
"6382","Subadviser under this Agreement, the Adviser agrees to pay to the"
"6383","Subadviser a fee at the annual rate set forth in Schedule A hereto"
"6384","with respect to each Fund, or portion thereof, that the Subadviser"
"6385","manages.  Such fee shall be accrued daily and paid monthly as soon as"
"6386","practicable after the end of each month (i.e., the"
"6387","applicable annual fee rate divided by 365 applied to each prior"
"6388","days' net assets in order to calculate the daily accrual).  If the"
"6389","Subadviser shall provide its services under"
"6390","this Agreement for less than the whole of any month, the foregoing"
"6391","compensation shall be prorated."
"6392","	4.	Other Services.  (a)	At the request of the"
"6393","Corporation or the Adviser, the Subadviser, in its discretion,"
"6394","may make availableto the Corporation office facilities, equipment,"
"6395","personnel and other services.  Such office facilities, equipment,"
"6396","personnel and services shall be provided for or rendered"

"6400","hereunder shall not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Subadviser"
"6401","shall be free to render similar or different services.  Nothing herein"
"6402","shall be deemed to prohibit, limit or restrict the Subadviser, its"
"6403","directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates and shareholders from"

"6418","Subadvisor acts in good faith and consistent with its fiduciary duties"
"6419","to the Fund and its other clients, and provided, further,"
"6420","that it is Subadviser's policy to allocate investment opportunities"
"6421","to the Fund (or allocated portion thereof) over a period of time"
"6422","on a fair and equitable basis relative to the Affiliated Accounts,"
"6423","taking into account the investment objectives and policies of the Fund"
"6424","and any specific investment restrictions applicable thereto."
"6425","The Adviser acknowledges that one or more of the Affiliated Accounts"
"6426","may at any time hold, acquire, increase, decrease, dispose of or"
"6427","otherwise deal with positions in investments in which the Fund may"
"6428","have an interest from time to time, whether in transactions which"
"6429","may involve the Fund or otherwise.  The Sub-Adviser shall have no"
"6430","obligation to acquire for the Fund (or allocated portion thereof)"
"6431","a position in any investment which any Affiliated Account may"
"6432","acquire."
"6433","	5.	Reports.  The Corporation, the Adviser and the"
"6434","Subadviser agree to furnish to each other, if applicable, current"
"6435","prospectuses, statements of additional information, proxy"
"6436","statements, reports of shareholders, certified copies of their financial"
"6437","statements, and such other information with regard to"
