"1138","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1139","To the Board of Trustees of Delaware Group? Government Fund and Shareholders of Delaware Core Plus Bond Fund and Delaware Emerging Markets Debt Fund:"
"1140","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Delaware Core Plus Bond Fund and Delaware Emerging Markets Debt Fund (constituting Delaware Group Government Fund, hereafter referred to as the ?Trust?) as of and for the year ended July 31, 2015, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust?s internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust?s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"1141","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A trust?s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A trust's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the trust; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the trust are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the trust; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a trust?s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1142","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1143","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Trust's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1144","Our consideration of the Trust?s internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust?s internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of July 31, 2015."
"1145","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Trustees of Delaware Group Government Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1171","          The undersigned Trustees of Delaware Group Government Fund, a Delaware statutory trust (the ?Trust?), constituting a majority of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, do hereby certify that pursuant to the authority granted to the Trustees in Article VIII, Section 5 of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust of the Trust made as of December 17, 1998, as amended to date (the ?Declaration of Trust?), the Declaration of Trust is hereby amended as follows:"
"1172","	FIRST.		ARTICLE III of the Declaration of Trust is hereby amended by inserting a new Section 3 as follows, and renumbering the current Sections 3-7 of Article III:"
"1173","	Section 3.	Transfer of Shares.  Except as otherwise provided by the Board of Trustees, Shares shall be transferable on the books of the Trust only by the record holder thereof or by his, her or its duly authorized agent upon delivery to the Board of Trustees or the Trust?s transfer agent of a duly executed instrument of transfer, together with a Share certificate if one is outstanding, and such evidence of the genuineness of each such execution and authorization and of such other matters as may be required by the Board of Trustees. Upon such delivery, and subject to any further requirements specified by the Board of Trustees or contained in the By-Laws, the transfer shall be recorded on the books of the Trust. Until a transfer is so recorded, the Shareholder of record of Shares shall be deemed to be the Shareholder with respect to such Shares for all purposes hereunder and neither the Board of Trustees nor the Trust, nor any transfer agent or registrar or any officer, employee or agent of the Trust, shall be affected by any notice of a proposed transfer."
"1174","	SECOND.	ARTICLE VI, Section 2 of the Declaration of Trust is hereby amended by adding the following paragraph (e) at the end thereof:"
"1175","	The Shareholders shall upon demand disclose to the Trustees in writing such information with respect to direct and indirect ownership of Shares as the Trustees deem necessary to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or any successor statute thereto), or to comply with the requirements of any other taxing authority."
"1176","	THIRD.	This Certificate of Amendment may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument."
"1177","          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Trustees have duly executed this Certificate of Amendment as of the 21 day of May, 2015."

"1238","Trust.  For  purposes of these Amended and Restated By-Laws (the By-Laws), the"

"1240","     Section  2. CALL OF MEETING. A meeting of the shareholders may be called at"

"1266","Trust's  principal  executive  office.  Notice"
"1267","<PAGE>"
"1268","shall  be  deemed  to  have  been given at the time when delivered personally or"
"1269","deposited in the mail, with a courier or sent by telegram, facsimile, electronic"
"1270","mail  or  other  means  of  written  communication."
"1271","     If any notice addressed to a shareholder at the address of that shareholder"
"1272","appearing  on the books of the Trust is returned to the Trust marked to indicate"

"1282","maintained in the records of the Trust.  Such affidavit shall, in the absence of"
"1283","fraud,  be  prima  facie  evidence  of  the  facts  stated  therein."
"1284","     Section 5. ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE. Any shareholders' meeting, whether or"
"1285","not  a  quorum  is  present, may be adjourned from time to time (and at any time"
"1286","during  the  course  of  the  meeting)  by a majority of the votes cast by those"
"1287","shareholders  present  in  person  or  by  proxy,  or  by the chairperson of the"
"1288","meeting.  Any  adjournment may be with respect to one or more proposals, but not"
"1289","necessarily  all  proposals,  to  be voted or acted upon at such meeting and any"
"1290","adjournment will not delay or otherwise affect the effectiveness and validity of"
"1291","a  vote  or  other action taken at a shareholders' meeting prior to adjournment."
"1292","     When  any  shareholders'  meeting  is  adjourned  to another time or place,"
"1293","notice  need  not  be given of the adjourned meeting at which the adjournment is"
"1294","taken,  unless a new record date of the adjourned meeting is fixed or unless the"
"1295","adjournment  is for more than one hundred eighty (180) days from the record date"
"1296","set  for  the  original meeting, in which case the Board of Trustees shall set a"
"1297","new record date. If notice of any such adjourned meeting is required pursuant to"
"1298","the preceding sentence, it shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled"
"1299","to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance with the provisions of Sections 3"
"1300","and  4  of  this  Article.  At any adjourned meeting, the Trust may transact any"
"1301","business  that  might  have  been  transacted  at  the  original  meeting."
"1302","     Section  6.  VOTING.  The  shareholders  entitled to vote at any meeting of"
"1303","shareholders  shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the provisions of the"
"1304","Declaration  of  Trust, as in effect at such time. The shareholders' vote may be"
"1305","by  voice  vote  or by ballot; provided, however, that any election for trustees"
"1306","must  be  by  ballot if demanded by any shareholder before the voting has begun."
"1307","     Abstentions  and  broker  non-votes  will  be  included  for  purposes  of"
"1308","determining whether a quorum is present at a shareholders' meeting.  Abstentions"
"1309","and  broker  non-votes  will  be  treated  as  votes  present at a shareholders'"
"1310","meeting,  but  will  not  be  treated  as  votes  cast.  Abstentions  and broker"
"1311","non-votes, therefore, will have no effect on proposals which require a plurality"
"1312","or  majority of votes cast for approval, but will have the same effect as a vote"
"1313","against on proposals requiring a majority of outstanding voting securities for"
"1314","approval."
"1315","     Unless  otherwise  determined  by  the  Board  of  Trustees  at the time it"
"1316","approves an action to be submitted to the shareholders for approval, shareholder"
"1317","approval  of  an  action  shall remain in effect until such time as the approved"
"1318","action is implemented or the shareholders vote to the contrary.  Notwithstanding"
"1319","the  foregoing,  an  agreement  of  merger or consolidation may be terminated or"
"1320","amended  notwithstanding  prior  approval  if so authorized by such agreement of"
"1321","merger or consolidation pursuant to Section 3815 of the Delaware Statutory Trust"
"1322","Act  (DSTA)."
"1323","<PAGE>"
"1324","     Section   7.  WRITTEN  ACTION.  Any action that might be taken at a meeting"
"1325","of  the  shareholders  may  be  taken  without  a meeting in accordance with the"
"1326","provisions  of the Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as may be amended"
"1327","from  time  to  time."
"1328","     Section  8.  WAIVER  OF  NOTICE  BY  CONSENT  OF  ABSENT SHAREHOLDERS.  The"
"1329","transactions  of  a  meeting  of  shareholders,  however  called and noticed and"
"1330","wherever  held, shall be valid as though transacted at a meeting duly held after"
"1331","regular  call  and  notice  if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy."
"1332","Attendance  by  a  person  at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice"
"1333","with  respect  to that person of that meeting, except when the person objects at"
"1334","the  beginning  of  the  meeting  to the transaction of any business because the"
"1335","meeting  is  not  lawfully called or convened and except that such attendance is"
"1336","not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters not included"
"1337","in  the  notice  of  the  meeting  if  that  objection  is expressly made at the"
"1338","beginning  of the meeting.  Whenever notice of a meeting is required to be given"
"1339","to  a  shareholder  under  the  Declaration of Trust or these By-Laws, a written"
"1340","waiver  thereof, executed before or after the meeting by such shareholder or his"
"1341","or  her attorney thereunto authorized and filed with the records of the meeting,"
"1342","shall  be  deemed  equivalent  to  such  notice."
"1343","     Section  9.  PROXIES. Every shareholder entitled to vote for trustees or on"
"1344","any  other  matter  shall  have the right to do so either in person or by one or"
"1345","more  agents  authorized  by a written proxy signed by the shareholder and filed"
"1346","with  the  secretary  of  the  Trust.  A  proxy  shall  be  deemed signed if the"
"1347","shareholder's  name  is  placed  on  the  proxy  (whether  by  manual signature,"
"1348","typewriting,  telegraphic transmission, electronic transmission or otherwise) by"
"1349","the  shareholder or the shareholder's attorney-in-fact. A validly executed proxy"
"1350","which  does  not  state  that it is irrevocable shall continue in full force and"
"1351","effect  unless  (i)  revoked by the shareholder executing it by a written notice"
"1352","delivered  to  the  Trust  prior  to  the  exercise  of  the  proxy  or  by  the"
"1353","shareholder's  execution  of a subsequent proxy or attendance and vote in person"
"1354","at  the  meeting;  or  (ii)  written  notice  of  the death or incapacity of the"
"1355","shareholder  is  received  by  the  Trust  before  the  proxy's vote is counted;"
"1356","provided,  however,  that no proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven"
"1357","(11)  months  from the date of the proxy unless otherwise provided in the proxy."
"1358","     A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a shareholder shall be"
"1359","deemed  valid  unless  challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of"
"1360","proving  invalidity  shall  rest on the challenger. Subject to the provisions of"
"1361","the  Delaware  Statutory  Trust Act, the Declaration of Trust, or these By-Laws,"

"1705","forth  in  the  preceding  paragraph  and  is  fairly and reasonably entitled to"
"1706","indemnity  for  the  expenses  which  the  court  shall  determine;  or"
"1707","     (b) In respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which that person shall"

"1728","the  agent  is  proper  in  the  circumstances  because  the  agent  has met the"
"1729","applicable  standard of conduct set forth in Sections 2 or 3 of this Article and"

"1746","     Section  8.  CONTRACT  RIGHTS.  With  respect to any person who was or is a"
"1747","party  or  is  threatened to be made a party to, or is involved as a witness in,"
