"1553","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1554","To the Trustees of the American Century Government Income"
"1555","Trust and Shareholders of the Capital Preservation Fund,"
"1556","the Ginnie Mae Fund, the Government Bond Fund, the"
"1557","Inflation-Adjusted Bond Fund and the Short-Term"
"1558","Government Fund:"
"1559","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"1560","statements of the American Century Government Income"
"1561","Trust (&#147;the Funds&#148;) as of and for the year ended"
"1562","March 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of"
"1563","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"1564","we considered the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting,"
"1565","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1566","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"1567","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1568","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"1569","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over"
"1570","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"1571","the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting."
"1572","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1573","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1574","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1575","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund&#146;s internal"
"1576","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1577","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1578","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1579","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund&#146;s internal control"
"1580","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"1581","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1582","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1583","assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"1584","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"1585","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"1586","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accor"
"1587","dance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"1588","(3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"1589","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund&#146;s assets that"
"1590","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1591","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1592","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1593","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1594","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1595","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1596","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1597","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"1598","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1599","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1600","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"1601","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"1602","the Funds&#146; annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1603","detected on a timely basis."
"1604","Our consideration of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting was"
"1605","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1606","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1607","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"1608","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"1609","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds&#146; internal control over financial"
"1610","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities"
"1611","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"1612","March 31, 2010."
"1613","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"1614","the Board of Directors of the American Century Government Income Trust and"
"1615","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"1616","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1637","(a)(1) Inflation-Adjusted Bond, Ginnie Mae, Government Bond and Short-Term"
"1638","Government each renamed its Advisor Class &#147;A Class&#148;, effective 03/01/10."
"1639","The Advisor Class shares of each of the funds were renamed A Class shares."
"1640","A Class shares have a front end sales charge (load).  However, the sales"
"1641","charge on A Class shares will be waived for purchases of additional shares"
"1642","in accounts that held shares of an Advisor Class fund prior to March 1, 2010."
"1643","(b)(1) Inflation-Adjusted Bond, a series of the Registrant (the trust), began"
"1644","offering C and R Classes during the period, effective 03/01/10."
"1645","	(2) Ginnie Mae, a series of the trust, began offering C Class during"
"1646","the period, effective 03/01/10."
"1647","(3) Government Bond and Short-Term Government, each a series of the trust,"
"1648","began offering Institutional, C and R Classes during the period, effective"
"1649","03/01/10."
"1650","    Each fund is a series of shares issued by the trust, and shares of each"
"1651","fund have equal voting rights. In addition, each series (or fund) may be"
"1652","divided into separate classes. Additional funds and classes may be added"
"1653","without a shareholder vote. Each fund votes separately on matters affecting"
"1654","that fund exclusively. Voting rights are not cumulative, so that investors"
"1655","holding more than 50% of the trust&#146;s (i.e.., all funds&#146;) outstanding shares"
"1656","may be able to elect a Board of Trustees. The trust undertakes dollar-based"
"1657","voting, meaning that the number of votes a shareholder is entitled to is based"
"1658","upon the dollar amount of the shareholder&#146;s investment. The election of"
"1659","trustees is determined by the votes received from all trust shareholders"
"1660","without regard to whether a majority of shares of any one fund voted in"
"1661","favor of a particular nominee or all nominees as a group."
"1662","    Each shareholder has rights to dividends and distributions declared by"
"1663","the fund he or she owns and to the net assets of such fund upon its"
"1664","liquidation or dissolution proportionate to his or her share ownership"
"1665","interest in the fund. Shares of each fund have equal voting rights,"
"1666","although each fund votes separately on matters affecting that fund"
"1667","exclusively."
"1668","    The assets belonging to each series are held separately by the custodian"
"1669","and the shares of each series represent a beneficial interest in the"
"1670","principal, earnings and profit (or losses) of investments and other"
"1671","assets held for each series. Shareholder rights are the same for all"
"1672","series of securities unless otherwise stated. Within their respective"
"1673","series, all shares have equal redemption rights. Each share, when"
"1674","issued, is fully paid and non-assessable."
"1675","    The A, C, and R Class shares of the funds are made available to"
"1676","participants in employer-sponsored retirement plans and to persons"
"1677","purchasing through broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies and"
"1678","other financial intermediaries that provide various administrative,"
"1679","shareholder and distribution services. The funds&#146; distributor enters"
"1680","into contracts with various banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies"
"1681","and other financial intermediaries, with respect to the sale of the"
"1682","funds&#146; shares and/or the use of the funds&#146; shares in various investment"
"1683","products or in connection with various financial services."
"1684","    Certain recordkeeping and administrative services that would"
"1685","otherwise be performed by the funds&#146; transfer agent may be performed"
"1686","by a plan sponsor (or its agents) or by a financial intermediary for"
"1687","A Class, C Class and R Class investors. In addition to such services,"
"1688","the financial intermediaries provide various individual shareholder"
"1689","and distribution services."
"1690","    To enable the funds&#146; shares to be made available through such"
"1691","plans and financial intermediaries, and to compensate them for such"
"1692","services, the funds&#146; Board of Trustees has adopted the A, C and"
"1693","R Class Plans."
"1694","Pursuant to the A Class Plan, the A Class pays the funds&#146;"
"1695","distributor 0.25% annually of the average daily net asset value of the"
"1696","funds&#146; A Class shares. The distributor may use these fees to pay for"
"1697","certain ongoing shareholder and administrative services and for"
"1698","distribution services, including past distribution services. This"
"1699","payment is fixed at 0.25% and is not based on expenses incurred by"
"1700","the distributor."
"1701","Pursuant to the C Class Plan, the C Class pays the funds&#146;"
"1702","distributor 1.00% annually of the average daily net asset"
"1703","value of the funds&#146; C Class shares, 0.25% of which is paid"
"1704","for certain ongoing individual shareholder and administrative"
"1705","services and 0.75% of which is paid for distribution services,"
"1706","including past distribution services. This payment is fixed"
"1707","at 1.00% and is not based on expenses incurred by the distributor."
"1708","Pursuant to the R Class Plan, the R Class pays the funds&#146;"
"1709","distributor 0.50% annually of the average daily net asset value"
"1710","of the R Class shares.  The distributor may use these fees to"
"1711","pay for certain ongoing shareholder and administrative services"
"1712","and for distribution services, including past distribution"
"1713","services. This payment is fixed at 0.50% and is not based on"
"1714","expenses incurred by the distributor."
"1715","The distributor then makes these payments to the financial"
"1716","intermediaries (including underwriters and broker-dealers, who"
"1717","may use some of the proceeds to compensate sales personnel) who"
"1718","offer the A Class for the services described below. No portion"
"1719","of these payments is used by the distributor to pay for advertising,"
"1720","printing costs or interest expenses."
"1721","    Payments may be made for a variety of individual shareholder"
"1722","services, including, but not limited to:"
"1723","    (a)  providing individualized and customized investment advisory"
"1724","services, including the consideration of shareholder profiles and"
"1725","specific goals;"
"1726","    (b)  creating investment models and asset allocation models"
"1727","for use by shareholders in selecting appropriate funds;"
"1728","    (c)  conducting proprietary research about investment choices"
"1729","and the market in general;"
"1730","    (d)  periodic rebalancing of shareholder accounts to ensure"
"1731","compliance with the selected asset allocation;"
"1732","    (e)  consolidating shareholder accounts in one place; and"
"1733","    (f)  other individual services."
"1734","    Individual shareholder services do not include those activities"
"1735","and expenses that are primarily intended to result in the sale of"
"1736","additional shares of the funds."
"1737","    Distribution services include any activity undertaken or expense"
"1738","incurred that is primarily intended to result in the sale of A Class,"
"1739","C Class or R Class shares, which services may include but are not"
"1740","limited to:"
"1741","    (a)  paying sales commissions, on-going commissions and other"
"1742","payments to brokers, dealers, financial institutions or others who"
"1743","sell A Class, C Class or R Class shares pursuant to selling agreements;"
"1744","    (b)  compensating registered representatives or other employees"
"1745","of the distributor who engage in or support distribution of the"

"1747","    (c)  paying and compensating expenses (including overhead and"

"1764","    (j)  providing other reasonable assistance in connection with"

"1766","     (k)  organizing and conducting of sales seminars and payments"

"1771","services to investors, as contemplated by the Conduct Rules of"
"1772","the FINRA; and"
"1773","    (n)  such other distribution and services activities as the"
"1774","advisor determines may be paid for by the funds pursuant to the"
"1775","terms of the agreement between the corporation and the funds&#146;"
"1776","distributor and in accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the Investment"
"1777","Company Act."
"1778","    Each shareholder&#146;s ability to purchase, exchange, redeem"
"1779","and transfer shares will be affected by the policies of the"
"1780","financial intermediary through which he/she does business."
"1781","Some policy differences may include"
"1782","    &#149;	minimum investment requirements"
"1783","    &#149;	exchange policies"
"1784","    &#149;	fund choices"
"1785","    &#149;	cutoff time for investments"
"1786","    &#149;	trading restrictions"
"1787","    In addition, a financial intermediary may charge a transaction fee for"
"1788","the purchase or sale of fund shares. Those charges are retained by the"
"1789","financial intermediary and are not shared with American Century"
"1790","Investments or the funds."
"1791","    The funds have authorized certain financial intermediaries to"
"1792","accept orders on the funds&#146; behalf. American Century has selling"
"1793","agreements with these financial intermediaries requiring them to"
"1794","track the time investment orders are received and to comply with"
"1795","procedures relating to the transmission of orders. Orders must"
"1796","be received by the financial intermediary on the funds&#146; behalf"
"1797","before the time the net asset value is determined in order to"
"1798","receive that day&#146;s share price. If those orders are transmitted"
"1799","to American Century and paid for in accordance with the selling"
"1800","agreement, they will be priced at the net asset value next determined"
"1801","after your request is received in the form required by the intermediary."
"1802","    Unless otherwise specified below, the minimum initial"
"1803","investment amount to open an account is $2,500. Financial"
"1804","intermediaries may open an account with $250, but may require"
"1805","their clients to meet different investment minimums.  There is"
"1806","a $50 minimum for subsequent purchases. However, there is no subsequent"
"1807","purchase minimum for financial intermediaries or employer-sponsored"
"1808","retirement plans, but financial intermediaries may require their clients"
"1809","to meet different subsequent purchase requirements."
"1810","    The Institutional Class shares are made available for"
"1811","purchase by individuals and large institutional shareholders"
"1812","such as bank trust departments, corporations, retirement plans,"
"1813","endowments, foundations and financial advisors that meet the fund&#146;s"
"1814","minimum investment requirements. Institutional Class shares are"
"1815","not available for purchase by insurance companies for variable"
"1816","annuity and variable life products."
"1817","    The minimum initial investment amount for Institutional"
"1818","Class shares is $5 million ($3 million for endowments and"
"1819","foundations) per fund. If you invest with us through a financial"
"1820","intermediary, this requirement may be met if your financial"
"1821","intermediary aggregates your investments with those of other clients"
"1822","into a single group, or omnibus, account that meets the minimum."
"1823","The minimum investment requirement may be waived if you, or your financial"
"1824","intermediary if you invest through an omnibus account, have an aggregate"
"1825","investment in our family of funds of $10 million or more"
"1826","($5 million for endowments and foundations), or in other situations"
"1827","as determined by American Century Investments. In addition,"
"1828","financial intermediaries or plan recordkeepers may require"
"1829","retirement plans to meet certain other conditions, such as plan"
"1830","size or a minimum level of assets per participant, in order"
"1831","to be eligible to purchase Institutional Class shares."
"1832","    If you sell C, or in certain cases, A Class shares, you"
"1833","may pay a sales charge, depending on how long you have held"
"1834","your shares.  Redemption proceeds will be calculated using"
"1835","the net asset value (NAV) next determined after we receive a transaction"
"1836","request in good order."
"1837","A fund&#146;s net asset value, or NAV, is the price of the fund&#146;s shares."
"1838","    However, we reserve the right to delay delivery of redemption"
"1839","proceeds up to seven days. For example, each time a shareholder"
"1840","makes an investment with American Century, there is a seven-day"
"1841","holding period before we will release redemption proceeds from those"
"1842","shares, unless a shareholder provides us with satisfactory proof that"
"1843","the purchase funds have cleared.  For funds with CheckWriting privileges,"
"1844","we will not honor checks written against shares subject to this seven-day"
"1845","holding period. Investments by wire generally require only a one-day"
"1846","holding period. If you change your address, we may require that any"
"1847","redemption request made within 15 days be submitted in writing and be"
"1848","signed by all authorized signers with their signatures guaranteed."
"1849","If you change your bank information, we may impose a 15-day holding"
"1850","period before we will transfer or wire redemption proceeds to your bank."
"1851","Please remember, if you request redemptions by wire, $10 will be deducted"
"1852","from the amount redeemed. Your bank also may charge a fee.  In addition,"
"1853","we reserve the right to honor certain redemptions with"
"1854","securities, rather than cash."
"1855","    If, during any 90-day period, a shareholder redeems fund shares"
"1856","worth more than $250,000 (or 1% of the value of a fund&#146;s assets if"
"1857","that amount is less than $250,000), we reserve the right to pay part"
"1858","or all of the redemption proceeds in excess of this amount in readily"
"1859","marketable securities instead of in cash. The portfolio managers"
"1860","would select these securities from the fund&#146;s portfolio."
"1861","    We will value these securities in the same manner as we do in"
"1862","computing the fund&#146;s net asset value. We may provide these securities"
"1863","in lieu of cash without prior notice. Also, if payment is made in"
"1864","securities, the shareholder may have to pay brokerage or other"
"1865","transaction costs to convert the securities to cash."
"1866","    If the redemption would exceed this limit and the shareholder would"
"1867","like to avoid being paid in securities, please provide us with"
"1868","an unconditional instruction to redeem at least 15 days prior to the date"
"1869","on which the redemption transaction is to occur. The instruction"
"1870","must specify the dollar amount or number of shares to be redeemed and"
"1871","the date of the transaction. This minimizes the effect of the redemption"
"1872","on a fund and its remaining investors."
"1873","    If the shareholder&#146;s account balance falls below the minimum"
"1874","initial investment amount for any reason, American Century Investments"
"1875","reserves the right to redeem the shares in the account and send the"
"1876","proceeds to your address of record. Prior to doing so, we will notify"
"1877","the shareholder and give him/her 60 days to meet the minimum. Please"
"1878","note that shares redeemed in this manner may be subject to a sales"
"1879","charge if held less than the applicable time period.  The sharehol"
"1880","der also may incur tax liability as a result of the redemption."
"1881","For Institutional Class shares, we reserve the right to convert the"
"1882","shareholder&#146;s shares to Investor Class shares of the same fund."
"1883","The Investor Class shares have a unified management fee that"
"1884","is 0.20% higher than the Institutional Class."
"1885","    Within 90 days of a redemption of any A Class shares, you may"
"1886","reinvest all of the redemption proceeds in A Class shares of any"
"1887","American Century Investments fund at the then-current net asset value"
"1888","without paying an initial sales charge. At your request, any CDSC"
"1889","you paid on an A Class redemption that you are reinvesting will"
"1890","be credited to your account. You or your financial professional"
"1891","must notify the fund&#146;s transfer agent in writing at the time of"
"1892","the reinvestment to take advantage of this privilege, and you may"
"1893","use it only once per account. This privilege applies only if the"
"1894","new account is owned by the original account owner."
"1895","    You may exchange shares of the fund for shares of the same class"
"1896","of another American Century fund without a sales charge if you meet"
"1897","the following criteria:"
"1898","* The exchange is for a minimum of $100"
"1899","* For an exchange that opens a new account, the amount of the exchange"
"1900","must meet or exceed the minimum account size requirement for the fund"
"1901","receiving the exchange"
"1902","    For purposes of computing any applicable CDSC on shares that have"
"1903","been exchanged, the holding period will begin as of the date of purchase"
"1904","of the original fund owned. Exchanges from a money market fund are subject"
"1905","to a sales charge on the fund being purchased, unless"
"1906","the money market fund shares were acquired by exchange from a fund"
"1907","with a sales charge or by reinvestment of dividends or capital gains"
"1908","distributions."
"1909","    A signature guarantee - which is different from a notarized"
"1910","signature - is a warranty that the signature presented is genuine."
"1911","We may require a signature guarantee for the following transactions."
"1912","* You have chosen to conduct business in writing only and would like"
"1913","to redeem over $100,000."
"1914","* Your redemption or distribution check or automatic redemption is"
"1915","made payable to someone other than the account owners."
"1916","* Your redemption proceeds or distribution amount is sent by EFT"
"1917","(ACH or wire) to a destination other than your personal bank account."
"1918","* You are transferring ownership of an account over $100,000."
"1919","* You change your address and request a redemption over $100,000"
"1920","within 15 days."
"1921","* You change your bank information and request a redemption"
"1922","within 15 days."
"1923","    We reserve the right to require a signature guarantee for other"
"1924","transactions, at our discretion."
"1925","    Investment instructions are irrevocable. That means that once you"
"1926","have mailed or otherwise transmitted your investment instruction, you"
"1927","may not modify or cancel it. Each fund reserves the right to suspend the"
"1928","offering of shares for a period of time and to reject any"
"1929","specific investment (including a purchase by exchange). Additionally,"
"1930","we may refuse a purchase if, in our judgment, it is of a size that"
"1931","would disrupt the management of a fund."
"1932","    We reserve the right to change any stated investment requirement,"
"1933","including those that relate to purchases, exchanges and redemptions."
"1934","We also may alter, add or discontinue any service or privilege."
"1935","Changes may affect all investors or only those in certain classes or"
"1936","groups. In addition, from time to time we may waive a policy on"
"1937","a case-by-case basis, as the advisor deems appropriate."

"2030","Section 1.  Principal Office"
"2031","The Board of Trustees shall fix the location of the principal executive"
"2032","office of the Trust at any place within or outside The Commonwealth of"
"2033","Massachusetts."
"2034","Section 2.  Other Offices"
"2035","The Board of Trustees may at any time establish branch or subordinate"
"2036","offices at any place or places where the trust intends to do business."
"2037","ARTICLE II"
"2038","Meetings of Shareholders"
"2039","Section 1.  Place of Meetings"
"2040","Meetings of shareholders shall be held at any place within or outside"
"2041","The Commonwealth of Massachusetts designated by the Board of Trustees."
"2042","In the absence of any such designation, shareholders' meetings shall"
"2043","be held at the principal executive office of the Trust."
"2044","Section 2.  Call of Meeting"
"2045","A meeting of the shareholders shall be held whenever called by the Trustees"
"2046","and whenever required by the provisions of the 1940 Act.  A shareholder meeting"
"2047","may be called at any time by the Board of Trustees or by the Chairman of the"
"2048","Board or by the President.  If a shareholder meeting is a meeting of the"
"2049","shareholders of one or more series or classes of shares, but not a meeting"
"2050","of all shareholders of the Trust, then only special meetings of the"
"2051","shareholders of such one or more series or classes shall be called and"
"2052","only the shareholders of such one or more series or classes shall be"
"2053","entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting."
"2054","Section 3.  Notice of Shareholders' Meeting"
"2055","All notices of meetings of shareholders shall be sent or otherwise given in"
"2056","accordance with Section 4 of this Article II not less than ten (10) nor"
"2057","more than ninety (90) days before the date of the meeting.  The notice"
"2058","shall specify (i) the place, date and hour of the meeting, and"
"2059","(ii) the general nature of the business to be transacted.  The notice of"
"2060","any meeting at which trustees are to be elected also shall include the"
"2061","name of any nominee or nominees whom at the time of the notice"
"2062","are intended to be presented for election."
"2063","If action is proposed to be taken at any meeting for approval of (i) a contract"
"2064","or transaction in which a trustee has a direct or indirect financial interest,"
"2065","(ii) an amendment of the Declaration of Trust, (iii) a reorganization of"
"2066","the Trust, or (iv) a voluntary dissolution of the"
"2067","Trust, the notice shall also state the general nature of that proposal."
"2068","Section 4.  Manner of Giving Notice; Affidavit of Notice"
"2069","Notice of any meeting of shareholders shall be given either personally or by"
"2070","first-class mail or telegraphic or other written communication, charges"
"2071","prepaid, addressed to the shareholder at the address of that shareholder"
"2072","appearing on the books of the Trust or its transfer agent"
"2073","or given by the shareholder to the Trust for the purpose of notice.  If no"
"2074","such address appears on the Trust's books or is given, notice shall be"
"2075","deemed to have been given if sent to that shareholder by"
"2076","first-class mail or telegraphic or other written communication to the"
"2077","Trust's principal executive office, or if published at least once in"
"2078","a newspaper of general circulation in the county where that office is"
"2079","located.  Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when"
"2080","delivered personally or deposited in the mail or sent by telegram or"
"2081","other means of written communication."
"2082","If any notice addressed to a shareholder at the address of that shareholder"
"2083","appearing on the books of the Trust is returned to the Trust by the United"
"2084","States Postal Service marked to indicate that the Postal Service is unable"
"2085","to deliver the notice to the shareholder at the address,"
"2086","all future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given"
"2087","without further mailing if these shall be available to the shareholder on"
"2088","written demand of the shareholder at the principal executive"
"2089","office of the Trust for a period of one year from the date of the giving"
"2090","of the notice."
"2091","An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any"
"2092","shareholder's meeting shall be executed by the Secretary, an Assistant"
"2093","Secretary or any transfer agent of the Trust giving the notice and shall"
"2094","be filed and maintained in the minute book of the Trust."
"2095","Section 5.  Adjourned Meeting; Notice"
"2096","Any shareholder's meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be"
"2097","adjourned from time to time by the vote of the majority of the shares"
"2098","represented at that meeting, either in person or by proxy."
"2099","When any meeting of shareholders is adjourned to another time or place,"
"2100","notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting at which the adjournment"
"2101","is taken, unless a new record date of the adjourned meeting is fixed or"
"2102","unless the adjournment is for more than ninety (90) days from"
"2103","the date set for the original meeting, in which case the Board of Trustees"
"2104","shall set a new record date.  Where required, notice of any such"
"2105","adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record"
"2106","entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance with the provisions"
"2107","of Section 3 and 4 of this Article II.  At any adjourned meeting, the"
"2108","Trust may transact any business which might have been"
"2109","transacted at the original meeting."
"2110","Section 6.  Voting"
"2111","The shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders shall"
"2112","be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of"
"2113","Trust, as in effect at such time.  The shareholders' vote may be by voice"
"2114","vote or by ballot, provided, however, that any election for trustees"
"2115","must be by ballot if demanded by any shareholder before the voting has begun."
"2116","On any matter other than elections of trustees, any shareholder may vote"
"2117","part of the shares in favor of the proposal and refrain"
"2118","from voting the remaining shares or vote them against the proposal, but if the"
"2119","shareholder fails to specify the number of shares which the shareholder is"
"2120","voting affirmatively, it will be conclusively"
"2121","presumed that the shareholder's approving vote is with respect to the total"
"2122","shares that the shareholder is entitled to vote on such proposal."
"2123","Section 7.  Waiver of Notice by Consent of Absent Shareholders"
"2124","The transactions of the meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed"
"2125","and wherever held, shall be as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after"
"2126","regular call and notice if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy"
"2127","and if either before or after the meeting, each"

"2188","proxy signed by the person and filed with the Secretary of the Trust.  A proxy"
"2189","shall be deemed signed if the shareholder's"

"2208","that proxy is counted; provided however, that no proxy shall be valid after"
"2209","the expiration of eleven (11) months from the date of the proxy unless"
"2210","otherwise provided in the proxy.  The revocability of a proxy"

"2212","provisions of the General Corporation Law of the Commonwealth of"
"2213","Massachusetts, as if the Trust were a Massachusetts corporation."

INTERIM MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

This MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (&#147;Agreement&#148;) is effective as of
the 16th day of February, 2010 by and between AMERICAN CENTURY
GOVERNMENT INCOME TRUST, a Massachusetts business trust and
registered investment company (the &#147;Company&#148;), and AMERICAN
CENTURY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, INC., a Delaware corporation
(the &#147;Investment Manager&#148;).

	WHEREAS, a majority of those members of the Board of
Trustees of the Company (collectively, the &#147;Board of Directors&#148;,
and each Trustee individually a &#147;Director&#148;) who are not
&#147;interested persons&#148; as defined in the Investment Company
Act (hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Independent Directors&#148;),
has approved this Agreement as it relates to each series of shares
of the Company set forth on Schedule B attached hereto (the &#147;Funds&#148;).

	NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual promises and
agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:
1.	Investment Management Services. The Investment Manager shall
supervise the investments of each class of each Fund. In such capacity,
the Investment Manager shall maintain a continuous investment program
for each such Fund, determine what securities shall be purchased or
sold by each Fund, secure and evaluate such information as it deems
proper and take whatever action is necessary or convenient to perform
its functions, including the placing of purchase and sale orders.
In performing its duties hereunder, the Investment Manager will manage
the portfolio of all classes of shares of a particular Fund as a single
portfolio.
2.	Compliance with Laws. All functions undertaken by the Investment
Manager hereunder shall at all times conform to, and be in accordance
with, any requirements imposed by:
(a)	the Investment Company Act and any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder;
(b)	any other applicable provisions of law;
(c)	the Declaration of Trust of the Company as amended from time to time;
(d)	the Bylaws of the Company as amended from time to time;
(e)	the Multiple Class Plan of the Company as amended from time to time; and
(f)	the registration statement(s) of the Company, as amended from time to
time, filed under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act.
3.	Board Supervision. All of the functions undertaken by the Investment
Manager hereunder shall at all times be subject to the direction of the Board
of Directors, its executive committee, or any committee or officers of the
Company acting under the authority of the Board of Directors.
4.	Payment of Expenses.  The Investment Manager will pay all the expenses
of each class of each Fund that it shall manage, other than interest, taxes,
brokerage commissions, portfolio insurance, extraordinary expenses, the fees
and expenses of the Independent Directors (including counsel fees), and expenses
incurred in connection with the provision of shareholder services and distribution
services under a plan adopted pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment
Company Act. The Investment Manager will provide the Company with all physical
facilities and personnel required to carry on the business of each class of
each Fund that it shall manage, including but not limited to office space,
office furniture, fixtures and equipment, office supplies, computer hardware
and software and salaried and hourly paid personnel. The Investment Manager
may at its expense employ others to provide all or any part of such facilities
and personnel.
5.	Account Fees.  The Board of Directors may impose fees for various
account services, proceeds of which may be remitted to the appropriate Fund
or the Investment Manager at the discretion of the Board of Directors. At
least 60 days&#146; prior written notice of the intent to impose such fee must
be given to the shareholders of the affected series.
6.	Management Fees.
(a)	In consideration of the services provided by the Investment Manager,
each class of a Fund shall pay to the Investment Manager a management fee that
is calculated as described in this Section 6 using the fee schedules described
herein.
(b)	Definitions
(1)	An &#147;Investment Team&#148; is the Portfolio Managers that the Investment
Manager has designated to manage a given portfolio.
(2)	An &#147;Investment Strategy&#148; is the processes and policies implemented
by the Investment Manager for pursuing a particular investment objective
managed by an Investment Team.
(3)	A &#147;Primary Strategy Portfolio&#148; is each Fund, as well as any other
series of any other registered investment company for which the Investment
Manager serves as the investment manager and for which American Century
Investment Services, Inc. serves as the distributor; provided, however,
that a registered investment company that invests its assets exclusively
in the shares of other registered investment companies shall not be a Primary
Strategy Portfolio. Any exceptions to the above requirements shall be approved
by the Board of Directors.
(4)	A &#147;Secondary Strategy Portfolio&#148; is another account managed by the
Investment Manager that is managed by the same Investment Team as that assigned
to manage any Primary Strategy Portfolio that shares the same board of directors
or board of trustees as the Company. Any exceptions to this requirement shall
be approved by the Board of Directors.
(5)	An &#147;Investment Category&#148; for a Fund is the group to which the Fund is
assigned for determining the first component of its management fee. Each Primary
Strategy Portfolio is assigned to one of the three Investment Categories indicated
below. The Investment Category assignments for the Funds appear in Schedule B to
this Agreement. The amount of assets in each of the Investment Categories
(&#147;Investment Category Assets&#148;) is determined as follows:
a)	Money Market Fund Category Assets.  The assets which are used to determine
the fee for this Investment Category is the sum of the assets of all of the
Primary Strategy Portfolios and Secondary Strategy Portfolios that invest primarily
in debt securities and are subject to Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act.
b)	Bond Fund Category Assets. The assets which are used to determine the fee
for this Investment Category is the sum the assets of all of the Primary Strategy
Portfolios and Secondary Strategy Portfolios that invest primarily in debt
securities and are not subject to Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act.
c)	Equity Fund Category Assets.  The assets which are used to determine the
fee for this Investment Category is the sum the assets of all of the Primary
Strategy Portfolios and Secondary Strategy Portfolios that invest primarily in
equity securities.
(6)	The &#147;Per Annum Investment Category Fee Dollar Amount&#148; for a Fund is the
dollar amount resulting from applying the applicable Investment Category Fee
Schedule for the Fund (as shown on Schedule A) using the applicable Investment
Category Assets.
(7)	The &#147;Per Annum Investment Category Fee Rate&#148; for a Fund is the percentage
rate that results from dividing the Per Annum Investment Category Fee Dollar Amount
for the Fund by the applicable Investment Category Assets for the Fund.
(8)	The &#147;Complex Assets&#148; is the sum of the assets in all of the Primary Strategy
Portfolios.
(9)	The &#147;Per Annum Complex Fee Dollar Amount&#148; for a class of a Fund shall be the
dollar amount resulting from application of the Complex Assets to the Complex Fee
Schedule for the class as shown in Schedule C.
(10)	The &#147;Per Annum Complex Fee Rate&#148; for a class of a Fund is the percentage
rate that results from dividing the Per Annum Complex Fee Dollar Amount for the
class of a Fund by the Complex Assets.
(11)	The &#147;Per Annum Management Fee Rate&#148; for a class of a Fund is the sum of
the Per Annum Investment Category Fee Rate applicable to the Fund and the Per
Annum Complex Fee Rate applicable to the class of the Fund.
(c)	Daily Management Fee Calculation.  For each calendar day, each class of
each Fund shall accrue a fee calculated by multiplying the Per Annum Management
Fee Rate for that class times the net assets of the class on that day, and further
dividing that product by 365 (366 in leap years).

Investment Manager shall enter into an Addendum to this Agreement setting forth
the name of the series and/or classes, as appropriate, the Applicable Fee and

and/or classes, or, in the alternative, enter into a separate management agreement
that relates specifically to such series or classes of shares.
7.	Continuation of Agreement.  This Agreement shall become effective for each
Fund as of the date first set forth above (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;) and shall continue

by the Investment Manager at any time without penalty upon giving the Company 60 days&#146;
written notice, and may be terminated, with respect to any Fund, at any time without
penalty by the Board of Directors or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities of each class of such Fund on 60 days&#146; written notice to the Investment
Manager.
9.	Effect of Assignment.  This Agreement shall automatically terminate with
respect to any Fund in the event of its assignment by the Investment Manager.  The

10.	Other Activities.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or restrict the

other aspects of any other business, whether of a similar or dissimilar nature,

for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services
hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale
of any security.
12.	Separate Agreement.  The parties hereto acknowledge that certain provisions
of the Investment Company Act, in effect, treat each series of shares of a registered
investment company as a separate investment company. Accordingly, the parties hereto
hereby acknowledge and agree that, to the extent deemed appropriate and consistent
with the Investment Company Act, this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute
a separate agreement between the Investment Manager and each Fund.
13.	Use of the Name &#147;American Century&#148;.  The name &#147;American Century&#148; and all
rights to the use of the name &#147;American Century&#148; are the exclusive property of
American Century Proprietary Holdings, Inc. (&#147;ACPH&#148;).  ACPH has consented to, and
granted a non-exclusive license for, the use by the Company of the name &#147;American
Century&#148; in the name of the Company and any Fund.  Such consent and non-exclusive
license may be revoked by ACPH in its discretion if ACPH, the Investment Manager,
or a subsidiary or affiliate of either of them is not employed as the investment
adviser of each Fund.  In the event of such revocation, the Company and each Fund
using the name &#147;American Century&#148; shall cease using the name &#147;American Century&#148;
unless otherwise consented to by ACPH or any successor to its interest in such
name.
       IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed by their respective duly authorized officers to be effective as of
the day and year first written above.
