"579"," REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"580","             ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"581","To the Shareholders and"
"582","Board of Trustees of"
"583","Investment Managers Series Trust"
"584","Glendora, California 91740"
"585","In  planning and performing our audit of"
"586","the   financial  statements  of  GaveKal"
"587","Platform  Company  Fund  (the  Fund),  a"
"588","series  of  Investment  Managers  Series"
"589","Trust,  as  of  and for the  year  ended"
"590","August 31, 2012, in accordance with  the"
"591","standards   of   the   Public    Company"
"592","Accounting   Oversight   Board   (United"
"593","States),   we  considered  its  internal"
"594","control    over   financial   reporting,"
"595","including    control   activities    for"
"596","safeguarding securities, as a basis  for"
"597","designing  our  auditing procedures  for"
"598","the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"599","the  financial statements and to  comply"
"600","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"601","not  for  the  purpose of expressing  an"
"602","opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the"
"603","Trusts  internal control over  financial"
"604","reporting.  Accordingly, we  express  no"
"605","such opinion."
"606","The   management   of   the   Trust   is"
"607","responsible    for   establishing    and"
"608","maintaining  effective internal  control"
"609","over    financial    reporting.       In"
"610","fulfilling      this     responsibility,"
"611","estimates  and  judgments by  management"
"612","are  required  to  assess  the  expected"
"613","benefits  and related costs of controls."
"614","A   companys   internal   control   over"
"615","financial   reporting   is   a   process"
"616","designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"617","regarding  the reliability of  financial"
"618","reporting   and   the   preparation   of"
"619","financial   statements   for    external"
"620","purposes  in  accordance with  generally"
"621","accepted   accounting  principles.     A"
"622","companys internal control over financial"
"623","reporting  includes those  policies  and"
"624","procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to   the"
"625","maintenance   of   records   that,    in"
"626","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"627","reflect     the     transactions     and"
"628","dispositions  of  the  assets   of   the"
"629","company;    (2)    provide    reasonable"
"630","assurance that transactions are recorded"
"631","as  necessary  to permit preparation  of"
"632","financial statements in accordance  with"
"633","generally       accepted      accounting"
"634","principles,   and  that   receipts   and"
"635","expenditures  of the company  are  being"
"636","made    only    in    accordance    with"
"637","authorizations    of   management    and"
"638","directors  of  the  company;   and   (3)"
"639","provide  reasonable assurance  regarding"
"640","prevention   or  timely   detection   of"
"641","unauthorized   acquisition,    use    or"
"642","disposition  of a companys  assets  that"
"643","could  have  a  material effect  on  the"
"644","financial statements."
"645","Because    of    inherent   limitations,"
"646","internal    control    over    financial"
"647","reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect"
"648","misstatements.    Also,  projections  of"
"649","any   evaluation  of  effectiveness   to"
"650","future  periods are subject to the  risk"
"651","that   controls  may  become  inadequate"
"652","because  of  changes in  conditions,  or"
"653","that  the degree of compliance with  the"
"654","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"655","A  deficiency  in internal control  over"
"656","financial  reporting  exists  when   the"
"657","design  or  operation of a control  does"
"658","not  allow  management or employees,  in"
"659","the  normal  course of performing  their"
"660","assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"661","misstatements  on a  timely  basis.    A"
"662","material  weakness is a  deficiency,  or"
"663","combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"664","control  over financial reporting,  such"
"665","that  there  is a reasonable possibility"
"666","that  a  material  misstatement  of  the"
"667","companys  annual  or  interim  financial"
"668","statements  will  not  be  prevented  or"
"669","detected on a timely basis."
"670","Our consideration of the Trusts internal"
"671","control over financial reporting was for"
"672","the  limited  purpose described  in  the"
"673","first    paragraph   and    would    not"
"674","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"675","internal  control that might be material"
"676","weaknesses  under standards  established"
"677","by   the   Public   Company   Accounting"
"678","Oversight    Board   (United    States)."
"679","However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"680","Trusts  internal control over  financial"
"681","reporting  and its operation,  including"
"682","controls  for  safeguarding  securities,"
"683","which   we   consider  to  be   material"
"684","weaknesses,  as  defined  above,  as  of"
"685","August 31, 2012."
"686","This  report is intended solely for  the"
"687","information   and  use  of   management,"
