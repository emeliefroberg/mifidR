"647","SUB-ITEM 77Q1(b): Copies of the text of any proposal"
"648","described in answer to sub-item 77D"
"649","Effective August 9, 2010 with respect to Loomis Sayles Core Plus"
"650","Bond Fund"
"651","Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80%"
"652","of its net assets (plus any borrowings made for investment"
"653","purposes) in bond investments.  The term bond investments"
"654","includes debt securities of any maturity.  In addition, the Fund"
"655","normally will invest primarily in investment-grade securities,"
"656","which are securities rated in one of the top four ratings categories"
"657","by at least one of the three major ratings agencies (Moodys"
"658","Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), Fitch Investors Services, Inc."
"659","(Fitch) or Standard and Poors Ratings Group (S&P)).  For"
"660","purposes of this restriction, investment-grade securities also"
"661","include cash and cash equivalent securities.  The Fund will"
"662","generally seek to maintain an effective duration of +/- 2 years"
"663","relative to the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index."
"664","Duration is a measure of the expected life of a fixed-income"
"665","security that is used to determine the sensitivity of a securitys price"
"666","to changes in interest rates.  A fund with a longer average portfolio"
"667","duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a"
"668","fund with a shorter average portfolio duration.  By way of"
"669","example, the price of a bond fund with an average duration of five"
"670","years would be expected to fall approximately 5% if interest rates"
"671","rose by one percentage point.  While the effective duration for the"
"672","Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index fluctuates, as of"
"673","December 31, 2009, the effective duration was 4.57 years.  The"
"674","Fund may also invest up to 20% of its assets, at the time of"
"675","purchase, in bonds rated below investment-grade (commonly"
"676","known as junk bonds), and up to 10% of its assets in non-USD"
"677","securities.  There is no minimum rating for the securities in which"
"678","the Fund may invest."
"679","The Funds investments may include, for example, securities issued"
"680","by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations and governments, securities"
"681","issued by supranational entities, U.S. government sponsored"
"682","agency debenture and pass-through securities, commercial"
"683","mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities."

"693","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"694","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Natixis Funds Trust I:"
"695","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"696","Loomis Sayles Core Plus Bond Fund, a series of Natixis Funds"
"697","Trust I (the Fund) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2010,"
"698","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"699","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds internal"
"700","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"701","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"702","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and"
"703","to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"704","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
"705","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not"
"706","express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control"
"707","over financial reporting."
"708","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"709","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"710","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"711","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"712","related costs of controls.  A funds internal control over financial"
"713","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"714","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"715","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"716","generally accepted accounting principles.  A funds internal control"
"717","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"718","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"719","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"720","assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"721","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"722","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"723","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"724","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"725","management and trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"726","assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"727","acquisition, use or disposition of a funds assets that could have a"
"728","material effect on the financial statements."
"729","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"730","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"731","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"732","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of"
"733","changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"734","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"735","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"736","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"737","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"738","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A"
"739","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"740","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"741","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds"
"742","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"743","detected on a timely basis."
"744","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"745","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"746","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"747","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"748","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"749","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"750","Funds internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"751","including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"752","be material weaknesses as defined above as of September 30,"
"753","2010."
"754","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"755","management and the Board of Trustees of Natixis Funds Trust I and"
"756","the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be"
"757","and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"758","parties."
