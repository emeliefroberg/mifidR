"5948","<TEXT>"
"5949","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"5950","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of VALIC Company II:"
"5951","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"5952","VALIC Company II, (hereafter referred to as the Series) as of and for"
"5953","the year ended August 31, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the"
"5954","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"5955","considered the Series' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"5956","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"5957","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"5958","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"5959","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"5960","effectiveness of the Series' internal control over financial reporting."
"5961","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"5962","Series' internal control over financial reporting."
"5963","The management of the Series is responsible for establishing and"
"5964","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"5965","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"5966","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A"
"5967","fund's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"5968","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"5969","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"5970","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"5971","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"5972","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"5973","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"5974","dispositions of the assets of the funds; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"5975","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"5976","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"5977","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the funds are being"
"5978","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"5979","trustees of the funds; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"5980","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"5981","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"5982","financial statements."
"5983","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"5984","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"5985","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"5986","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"5987","or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"5988","deteriorate."
"5989","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"5990","design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"5991","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"5992","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"5993","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"5994","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility"
"5995","that a material misstatement of the Series' annual or interim financial"
"5996","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"5997","Our consideration of the Series' internal control over financial reporting"
"5998","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"5999","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"6000","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"6001","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"6002","States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Series' internal control"
"6003","over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"6004","safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as"
"6005","defined above as of August 31, 2010."
"6006","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"6007","and the Board of Trustees of"
"6008","VALIC Company II and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"6009","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"6010","specified parties."

ANNUITY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, hereinafter referred to as VALIC, and

Company II, an investment company organized under the
laws of Delaware as a business trust (VC II).  VC II is a

(or series) of shares of beneficial interest and is registered
as an open-end, management investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940"

except pursuant to a written contract.

In accordance with VC II's Agreement and Declaration of
Trust (the Declaration), new Funds may be added to VC

without the approval of shareholders. This Agreement will
apply only to the Fund(s) set forth on the attached Schedule
A, and any other Funds as may be added or deleted by
amendment to the attached Schedule A (Covered"
"6601","Fund(s)).

(d)	The SUB-ADVISER is engaged principally in the business
of rendering investment advisory services and is registered
as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act.

(e)	VALIC desires to enter into an Investment Sub-Advisory
Agreement with the SUB-ADVISER for all or a portion of
the assets of the Covered Fund(s) which VALIC determines
from time to time to assign to the SUB-ADVISER.  VALIC
acknowledges that the SUB-ADVISER intends to delegate
the day-to-day portfolio management of the Covered Fund
to its affiliate, Perkins Investment Management LLC
(PERKINS or the SUB-SUB-ADVISER).

	VALIC and the SUB-ADVISER AGREE AS FOLLOWS:

1.	Services Rendered and Expenses Paid by the SUB-ADVISER

The SUB-ADVISER, subject to the supervision and review of VALIC and the
Board and in conformity with the 1940 Act, all applicable laws and
regulations thereunder, and all other applicable federal and state securities
and tax laws and regulations, including section 817(h) and Subchapter M of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), the Declaration,
VC II's Bylaws (the Bylaws), each Covered Fund's registration statement,
prospectus, and stated investment objectives, policies and restrictions and
any applicable procedures adopted by the Board and provided to the SUB-
ADVISER, shall:



(a)	manage the investment and reinvestment of all of,
or to the extent applicable, a portion of, the assets of each
Covered Fund(s) including, for example, the evaluation of
pertinent economic, statistical, financial, and other data, the
determination of the industries and companies to be
represented in each Covered Fund's portfolio, and the
formulation and implementation of investment programs.

(b)	maintain a trading desk and place orders for the
purchase and sale of portfolio investments (including
futures contracts and options thereon) for each Covered
Fund's account with brokers or dealers (including futures
commission merchants) selected by the SUB-ADVISER, or
arrange for any other entity to provide a trading desk and to
place orders with brokers and dealers (including futures
commission merchants) selected by the SUB-ADVISER,
subject to the SUB-ADVISER's control, direction, and
supervision, which brokers or dealers may include brokers
or dealers (including futures commission merchants)
affiliated with the SUB-ADVISER, subject to applicable
law.

Without limiting the foregoing, the SUB-ADVISER represents and warrants
to VALIC that all of, or to the extent applicable the portion of, the assets
which it manages of the Covered Fund(s) set forth in Schedule A will at all
times be operated and managed in compliance with (a) all applicable federal
and state laws, including securities, commodities and banking laws, governing
its operations and investments; (b) applicable provisions of Subchapter M,
chapter 1 of the Code (Subchapter M) for each Covered Fund to be treated
as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M; (c) the
diversification requirements specified in the Internal Revenue Service's
regulations under Section 817(h) of the Code so as not to jeopardize the
treatment of the variable annuity contracts that offer the Covered Funds as
annuity contracts for purposes of the Code; (d) the distribution requirements
necessary to avoid payment of any excise tax pursuant to Section 4982 of the
Code; (e) the provisions of the 1940 Act and rules adopted thereunder; (f) the
objectives, policies, restrictions and limitations for the Covered Funds as
set forth in the Covered Funds' current prospectus and statement of additional
information as most recently provided by VALIC to the SUB-ADVISER; and
(g) the policies and procedures as adopted by the Board, as most recently
provided by VALIC to the SUB-ADVISER.  The SUB-ADVISER shall
furnish information to VALIC, as requested, for purposes of compliance with
the distribution requirements necessary to avoid payment of any excise tax
pursuant to Section 4982 of the Code.  The SUB-ADVISER further represents
and warrants that to the extent that any statements or omissions made in any
Registration Statement for shares of the Covered Funds, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, are made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished by the SUB-ADVISER expressly for use therein, such
Registration Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto will, when
they become effective, conform in all material respects to the requirements of
the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations of the Commission
thereunder (the 1933 Act) and the 1940 Act and will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

VALIC agrees that SUB-ADVISER shall manage the portion of the assets of a
Covered Fund allocated to it as if it was a separate operating fund, unless
instructed otherwise in writing from VALIC, and shall comply with the
representations and warranties stated in this Section (including, but not
limited to, the investment objectives, policies and restrictions applicable
to a Covered Fund and qualifications of a Covered Fund as a regulated
investmentcompany under the Code) with respect to the portion of assets of a
Covered Fund allocated to SUB-ADVISER.

The SUB-ADVISER may delegate any of its duties and obligations hereunder
to any affiliated person (as such term is defined in the 1940 Act) that is
eligible to serve as an investment adviser to an investment company registered
under the 1940 Act on such terms and conditions as it deems necessary or
appropriate, provided that VALIC and the Board consent to any such
delegation and to the terms and conditions thereof and such delegation is
permitted by and in conformity with the 1940 Act.  The SUB-ADVISER shall
be liable to VALIC for any loss or damage arising out of, in connection with
or related to the actions or omissions to act of any delegee utilized
hereunder.

In determining liability, the limitation of liability set forth in Section 7
of this Agreement shall apply to the actions or omissions to act of a delegee.

VALIC acknowledges that the SUB-ADVISER shall, pursuant to a separate
Sub-Sub-Advisory Agreement, delegate the day-to-day portfolio management
of the Covered Fund to Perkins.  The SUB-ADVISER shall notify VALIC of
any material amendments to the Sub-Sub-Advisory Agreement.

The SUB-ADVISER makes no representation or warranty, express or implied,
that any level of performance or investment results will be achieved by the
Covered Fund (or portion thereof) or that the Covered Fund will perform
comparably with any standard or index, including other clients of the SUB-
ADVISER.

The SUB-ADVISER will assist the Covered Fund(s) and its agents in
determining whether prices obtained for valuation purposes accurately reflect
the prices on the SUB-ADVISER's portfolio records relating to the assets of
the Covered Fund(s) for which the SUB-ADVISER has responsibility at such
times as VALIC shall reasonably request; provided, however, that the parties
acknowledge that the SUB-ADVISER is not the fund accounting agent for the
Covered Fund(s) and is not responsible for pricing determinations or
calculations and any information provided pursuant to this position by the
SUB-ADVISER will be provided for information purposes only.

In performing the services described in paragraph (b) above, the SUB-
ADVISER shall use its best efforts to obtain for the Covered Fund(s) the best
execution of portfolio transactions determined by SUB-ADVISER's best
execution policy.  Subject to approval by the Board of appropriate policies
and procedures, the SUB-ADVISER may cause the Covered Fund(s) to pay to
a broker a commission, for effecting a portfolio transaction, in excess of the
commission another broker would have charged for effecting the same
transaction, if the first broker provided brokerage and/or research services
to the SUB-ADVISER.  The SUB-ADVISER shall not be deemed to have acted
unlawfully, or to have breached any duty created by this Agreement, or
otherwise, solely by reason of acting in accordance with such authorization.

The SUB-ADVISER may aggregate sales and purchase orders of securities
held by the Covered Fund(s) with similar orders being made simultaneously
for other accounts managed by the SUB-ADVISER or with accounts of the
affiliates of the SUB-ADVISER, if in the SUB-ADVISER's reasonable
judgment such aggregation shall result in an overall economic benefit to the
Covered Fund(s) considering the advantageous selling or purchase price,
brokerage commission and other expenses. In accounting for such aggregated
order price, commission and other expenses shall be averaged on a per bond
or share basis daily.  VALIC acknowledges that the determination of such
economic benefit to the Covered Fund(s) by the SUB-ADVISER is subjective
and represents the SUB-ADVISER's evaluation that the Covered Fund(s) is
benefited by relatively better purchase or sales prices, lower commission
expenses and beneficial timing of transactions or a combination of these and
other factors.

The SUB-ADVISER shall maintain records adequately demonstrating
compliance with its obligations under this Agreement and report periodically
to VALIC and the Board regarding the performance of its services under this
Agreement.  The SUB-ADVISER will make available to VALIC and VC II
promptly upon their reasonable written request all of the Covered Fund(s)'s
investment records and ledgers to assist VALIC and VC II in compliance with
respect to the Covered Fund(s)'s securities transactions as required by the
1940 Act and the Advisers Act, as well as other applicable laws.  The SUB-
ADVISER will furnish the Board  with quarterly reports and such special
reports as VALIC and the Board may reasonably request.  The SUB-
ADVISER will furnish to regulatory authorities any information or reports in
connection with such services which may be requested in order to ascertain
whether the operations of the Covered Fund(s) are being conducted in a
manner consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

The SUB-ADVISER will not disclose or use any records or information
obtained pursuant to this Agreement in any manner whatsoever except as
expressly authorized in this Agreement, and will keep confidential any non-
public information obtained directly as a result of this service relationship,
and the SUB-ADVISER shall disclose such non-public information only if VALIC
or the Board have authorized such disclosure, or if such information is or
hereafter otherwise is known by the SUB-ADVISER or has been disclosed,
directly or indirectly, by VALIC or VC II to others becomes ascertainable
from public or published information or trade sources, or if such disclosure
is expressly required or requested by applicable federal or state regulatory
authorities or Court of Law of competent jurisdiction, or to the extent such
disclosure is reasonably required by auditors or attorneys of the SUB-
ADVISER in connection with the performance of their professional services.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the SUB-ADVISER may disclose the total
return earned by the Covered Fund(s) and may include such total return in the
calculation of composite performance information without prior approval by
VALIC or the Board.


Should VALIC at any time make any definite determination as to any
investment policy and notify the SUB-ADVISER in writing of such
determination, the SUB-ADVISER shall be bound by such determination for
the period, if any, specified in such notice or until similarly notified that
such determination has been revoked, provided such determination will permit
SUB-ADVISER to comply with the first paragraph of this Section.

The SUB-ADVISER will not hold money or investments on behalf of the
Covered Fund(s).  The money and investments will be held by the Custodian
of the Covered Fund(s) as identified pursuant to Schedule B.  The SUB-
ADVISER will arrange for the transmission to the Custodian for the Covered
Fund(s), on a daily basis, such confirmation, trade tickets and other documents
as may be necessary to enable it to perform its administrative responsibilities
with respect to the Covered Fund(s).  The SUB-ADVISER further shall have
the authority to instruct the custodian of the Covered Fund(s) (i) to pay cash
for securities and other property delivered to the Custodian for the Covered
Fund(s) (ii) to deliver securities and other property against payment for the
Covered Fund(s), and (iii) to transfer assets and funds to such brokerage
accounts as the SUB-ADVISER may designate, all consistent with the powers,
authorities and limitations set forth herein. The SUB-ADVISER shall not have
the authority to cause the Custodian to deliver securities and other property
except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

The SUB-ADVISER shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an
independent contractor and shall, unless otherwise provided or authorized,
have no authority to act or represent VALIC or VC II other than in furtherance
of the SUB-ADVISER's duties and responsibilities as set forth in this
Agreement.

Except as otherwise agreed, or as otherwise provided herein, the SUB-
ADVISER shall bear the expense of discharging its responsibilities hereunder
and VALIC shall pay, or arrange for others to pay, all VALIC's expenses,
except that VALIC shall in all events pay the compensation described in
Section 2 of the Agreement.  VALIC and the SUB-ADVISER acknowledge
that VC II will be ultimately responsible for all brokerage commissions, taxes,
custodian fees and other transaction-related fees incurred on behalf of the
Covered Fund(s).

The SUB-ADVISER also represents and warrants that in furnishing services
hereunder, the SUB-ADVISER will not consult with any other sub-adviser,
other than Perkins,  of the Covered Fund(s) or other series of  VC II, to the
extent any other sub-advisers are engaged by VALIC, or any other sub-
advisers to other investment companies that are under common control with
VC II, concerning transactions of the Covered Fund(s) in securities or other
assets, other than for purposes of complying with the conditions of paragraphs
(a) and (b) of rule 12d3-1 under the 1940 Act.

2.	Compensation of the SUB-ADVISER

VALIC shall pay to the SUB-ADVISER, as compensation for the services
rendered and expenses paid by the SUB-ADVISER, a monthly fee or fees
based on the Covered Fund(s)'s average daily net asset value computed for
each of the Covered Fund(s) including cash or cash equivalents as provided
for herein and in the fee schedule attached hereto as Schedule A.  Schedule A
may be amended from time to time, provided that amendments are made in
conformity with applicable laws and regulations and the Declaration and
Bylaws.  Any change in Schedule A pertaining to any new or existing Covered
Fund(s) shall not be deemed to affect the interest of any other Covered
Fund(s) and shall not require the approval of shareholders of any other
Covered Fund(s).

The average daily net asset value shall be determined by taking the mean
average of all of the determinations of net asset value, made in the manner
provided in the Declaration, as applicable, for each business day during a
given calendar month.  VALIC shall pay this fee for each calendar month as
soon as practicable after the end of that month, but in any event no later
than ten (10) business days following the end of the month, along with
supporting calculation documentation

	If the SUB-ADVISER serves for less than a whole month, the foregoing
compensation shall be prorated.

The payment of advisory fees related to the services of the SUB-ADVISER
under this Agreement shall be the sole responsibility of VALIC and shall
not be the responsibility of VC II or the Covered Fund(s).  Any
reimbursement of management fees required by any expense limitation
provision and any liability arising out of a violation of Section 36(b) of the
1940 Act shall be the sole responsibility of VALIC.

3.	Scope of the SUB-ADVISER's Activities

VALIC understands that the SUB-ADVISER and its affiliates now act, will
continue to act and may act in the future as investment adviser to fiduciary
and other managed accounts and as investment adviser to other investment
companies, and VALIC has no objection to the SUB-ADVISER so acting,
provided that whenever the Covered Fund(s) and one or more other accounts
or investment companies advised by the SUB-ADVISER have available funds
for investment, investments suitable and appropriate for each will be
allocated in accordance with a methodology believed to be equitable to each
entity. The SUB-ADVISER similarly agrees to allocate opportunities to sell
securities.VALIC recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure may limit the
size of the position that may be acquired or sold for the Covered Fund(s).
In addition, VALIC understands that the persons employed by the SUB-ADVISER to
assist in the performance of the SUB-ADVISER's duties hereunder will not
devote their full time to such service and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to limit or restrict the right of the SUB-ADVISER or any affiliate of
the SUB-ADVISER to engage in and devote time and attention to other
business or to render services of whatever kind or nature.  The SUB-
ADVISER may provide advice to or take action with respect to other clients,
which advice or action, including the timing and nature of such action, may
differ from or be identical to advice given or action taken with respect to
the Covered Fund.

Except as otherwise required by the 1940 Act, any of the shareholders,
directors, officers and employees of VALIC may be a shareholder, director,
officer or employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the SUB-ADVISER, and
in any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the
SUB-ADVISER; and the SUB-ADVISER, and any person controlling,
controlled by or under common control with the SUB-ADVISER, may have
an interest in VALIC.

VALIC shall perform quarterly and annual tax compliance tests and promptly
furnish reports of such tests to the SUB-ADVISER after each quarter end to
ensure that the Covered Fund(s) is in compliance with Subchapter M of the
Code and Section 817(h) of the Code.  VALIC shall apprise the SUB-
ADVISER promptly after each quarter end of any potential non-compliance
with the diversification requirements in such Code provisions. If so advised,
the SUB-ADVISER shall take prompt action so that the Covered Fund(s)
complies with such Code diversification provisions, as directed by VALIC.

         The SUB-ADVISER represents, warrants, and agrees as follows:

Agreement or interested persons of any such parties, cast in person at a

6.	Other Matters

The SUB-ADVISER may from time to time employ or associate with itself
any person or persons believed to be particularly fit to assist in its
performance of services under this Agreement, provided no such person
serves or acts as an investment adviser separate from the SUB-ADVISER so
as to require a new written contract pursuant to the 1940 Act.  The
compensation of any such persons will be paid by the SUB-ADVISER, and no
obligation will be incurred by, or on behalf of, VALIC or VC II with respect
to them.

The SUB-ADVISER agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule
31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1
under the 1940 Act.  The SUB-ADVISER agrees that all books and records
which it maintains for the Covered Fund(s) are the Covered Fund(s)'s
property and will be surrendered promptly to the Covered Fund(s) or VALIC
upon request.  The SUB-ADVISER agrees that all accounts, books and other
records maintained and preserved by it as required hereby shall be subject at
any time, and from time to time, to such reasonable periodic, special and other
examinations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Covered
Fund(s)'s auditors, the Covered Fund(s) or any representative of the Covered
Fund(s), VALIC, or any governmental agency or other instrumentality having
regulatory authority over the Covered Fund(s)

Statement of Additional Information, the Declaration and Bylaws as are

before or at the time the amendments or supplements become effective.  Until

reasonable legal and other expenses), to which VALIC or its affiliates or such
directors, officers or controlling person may become subject under the 1933

any failure by the SUB-ADVISER to comply with the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement; provided, however, that
in no case is the SUB-ADVISER's indemnity in favor of any person deemed to
protect such other persons against any liability to which such person would
otherwise be subject by reasons of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross
negligence in the performance of his, her or its duties or by reason of his,
her or its reckless disregard of obligation and duties under this Agreement.

including, but not limited to, a failure of VALIC to provide accurate and

other subadviser to a Covered Fund, which records are not also maintained by
or otherwise available to the SUB-ADVISER upon reasonable request.
