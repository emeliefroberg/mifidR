"515","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"516","Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"517","Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"518","450 Wireless Boulevard"
"519","Hauppauge, New York  11788"
"520","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"521","statements of The Collar Fund (the Fund), a series of"
"522","Northern Lights Fund Trust as of and for the year ended"
"523","April 30, 2011, in accordance with the standards of the"
"524","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"525"," we considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"526"," reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"527"," as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"528","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"529","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"530","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"531","on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"532"," financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"533","opinion."
"534","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing"
"535","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"536"," reporting.   In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"537"," and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"538"," expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"539","A companys internal control over financial reporting is"
"540","a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"541","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"542","preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"543"," in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"544","principles.   A companys internal control over financial"
"545","reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"546"," (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"547","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"548","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"549","company (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"550"," are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"551","financial statements in accordance with generally"
"552","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"553","and expenditures of the company are being made only"
"554","in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"555","directors of the company and (3) provide reasonable"
"556"," assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"557","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"558"," companys assets that could have a material effect"
"559","on the financial statements."
"560","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"
"561","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"562","   Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"563"," to future periods are subject to the risk that controls"
"564"," may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"565"," or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"566","procedures may deteriorate."
"567","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"568"," exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"569","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"570","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"571"," misstatements on a timely basis.   A material weakness is"
"572"," a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"573","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"574","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"575","the Funds annual or interim financial statements will"
"576","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"577","Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"578","Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"579","Page Two"
"580","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"581"," financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"582"," in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"583"," all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"584"," weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"585","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"586","  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds"
"587","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"588","including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider"
"589"," to be material weaknesses as defined above as of April 30, 2011."
"590","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"591","use of management, the Board of Trustees of the Northern"
"592"," Lights Fund Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission,"
"593","and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"594","anyone other than these specified parties."
