"1267","<TEXT>"
"1268","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Franklin"
"1269","California Tax-Free Trust"
"1270","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"1271","Franklin California Intermediate-Term Tax-Free Income Fund, Franklin"
"1272","California Insured Tax-Free Income Fund and Franklin California"
"1273","Ultra-Short Tax-Free Income Fund (the Funds) as of and for the"
"1274","year ended June 30, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the"
"1275","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"1276"," the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"1277"," over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1278","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1279","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"1280","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1281","Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do"
"1282","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"1283","control over financial reporting."
"1284","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1285","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1286","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1287","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1288","related costs of controls. A funds internal control over"
"1289","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1290","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"1291","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1292","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A funds"
"1293","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"1294","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,"
"1295","in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"1296","and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1297","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1298","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1299","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"1300","the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1301","management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"1302","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1303","use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect"
"1304","on the financial statements."
"1305","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1306","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"1307","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1308","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1309","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1310","procedures may deteriorate."
"1311","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1312","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"1313","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"1314","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"1315","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1316","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"1317","misstatement of the Funds annual or interim financial statements will"
"1318","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1319","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting"
"1320","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"1321","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over"
"1322","financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1323","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1324","(United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"1325","control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"1326","over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses"
"1327","as defined above as of June 30, 2016."

"1329","and the Board of Trustees of Franklin California Tax-Free Trust and the"

"1415","at the Closing to deliver to the Money Fund the number of the"
"1416","Ultra-Short Fund Shares, determined by dividing the net asset"
"1417","value per share of Class A shares of the Money Fund by the"
"1418","net asset value per share of Class A1 shares of the Ultra-Short Fund"
"1419","and separately multiplying the result thereof by the number of"
"1420","outstanding Class A shares of the Money Fund as of 1:00 p.m.,"
"1421","Pacific time, on the Closing Date.  The Ultra-Short Fund Shares"
"1422","delivered to the Money Fund at the Closing shall have an aggregate"
"1423","net asset value equal to the value of the Money Fund's net Assets,"
"1424","all determined as provided in Section 2 of the Plan and as of"
"1425","the date and time specified herein."
"1426","(c) Immediately following the Closing, the Money Fund shall"
"1427","distribute the Ultra-Short Fund Shares received by the Money Fund"
"1428","pursuant to this Section 1 pro rata to the Money Fund's"
"1429","shareholders of record, based upon their respective holdings of"
"1430","the Money Fund, as of the close of business on the Closing Date."
"1431","Such distribution shall be accomplished by the establishment of"
"1432","accounts on the share records of the Ultra-Short Fund of the"
"1433","type and in the amounts due such shareholders based on their"
"1434","respective holdings in the Money Fund as of the close of business"
"1435","on the Closing Date.  Fractional Ultra-Short Fund Shares shall be"
"1436","carried to the third decimal place. As promptly as practicable"
"1437","after the Closing, each holder of any outstanding certificate or"
"1438","certificates representing Money Fund Shares shall be entitled to"
"1439","surrender the same to the transfer agent for the Ultra-Short Fund"
"1440","in exchange for the number of the Ultra-Short Fund Shares of the"
"1441","same class into which the Money Fund Shares theretofore represented"
"1442","by the certificate or certificates so surrendered shall have been"
"1443","converted.  Until so surrendered, each outstanding certificate,"
"1444","if any, which, prior to the Closing, represented Money Fund Shares"
"1445","shall be deemed for all Ultra-Short Fund purposes to evidence"
"1446","ownership of the number of Ultra-Short Fund Shares into which"
"1447","Money Fund Shares (which prior to the Closing were represented thereby)"
"1448","have been converted.  Certificates for the Ultra-Short Fund Shares"
"1449","shall not be issued, unless specifically requested by a shareholder."
"1450","After the distribution, the Money Fund shall be dissolved."
"1451","(d) At the Closing, each shareholder of record of the Money Fund"
"1452","as of the record date (the Distribution Record Date) with respect"
"1453","to any unpaid dividends and other distributions that were declared"
"1454","prior to the Closing shall have the right to receive such unpaid"
"1455","dividends and distributions with respect to the shares of the"
"1456","Money Fund that such person had on such Distribution Record Date."
"1457","(e) All books and records relating to the Money Fund, including"
"1458","all books and records required to be maintained under the"
"1459","Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act), and the rules"
"1460","and regulations thereunder, shall be available to the"
"1461","Ultra-Short Fund from and after the date of the Plan, and"
"1462","shall be turned over to the Ultra-Short Fund on or prior to"
"1463","the Closing."
"1464","2.  Valuation."
"1465","(a) The net asset value of the Ultra-Short Fund Shares and the"
"1466","Money Fund Shares and the value of the Money Fund's Assets to"
"1467","be acquired by the Ultra-Short Fund hereunder shall in each"
"1468","case be computed as of 1:00 p.m., Pacific time, on the"
"1469","Closing Date, unless on such date:"
"1470","(i) the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is not open for"

"1473","extraordinary financial event or market condition occurs"
"1474","(each of the events described in (i), (ii) or (iii) are referred"
"1475","to as a Market Disruption).  The net asset value per share of"
"1476","the Ultra-Short Fund Shares and the Money Fund Shares and the"
"1477","value of the Money Fund's net Assets shall be computed in"
"1478","accordance with the valuation procedures set forth in the most"
"1479","recent respective prospectuses of the Ultra-Short Fund and"
"1480","the Money Fund, as amended or supplemented, except that the"
"1481","net asset value per share of the Money Fund shall be carried"
"1482","to the fourth decimal place."
"1483","(b) In the event of a Market Disruption on the proposed Closing"
"1484","Date so that an accurate appraisal of the net asset value of the"
"1485","Ultra-Short Fund Shares or the Money Fund Shares or the value of"
"1486","the Money Fund's net Assets is impracticable, the Closing Date"
"1487","shall be postponed until the first business day when regular"
"1488","trading on the NYSE shall have been fully resumed and reporting"
"1489","shall have been restored and other trading markets are"
"1490","otherwise stabilized."

"1492","Money Fund Shares calculated using market value deviates by"
"1493","more than 0.25 of 1% from the net asset value per share"
"1494","calculated using amortized cost, the Closing Date shall be"
"1495","postponed until the net asset value using market value and"
"1496","amortized cost for the Money Fund Shares is within the range"
"1497","of 0.25 of 1%."
"1498","(d) All computations of value regarding the net asset value of"

"1523","FCTFT, on behalf of the Ultra-Short Fund and/or the Money Fund,"
"1524","represents and warrants that:"
"1525","(a) Each Fund is a series of FCTFT, which was originally organized"

"1527","reorganized as a Delaware statutory trust effective on"
"1528","November 1, 2007.  FCTFT is validly existing under the laws of the"
"1529","State of Delaware.  FCTFT is duly registered under the 1940 Act as"
"1530","an open-end, management investment company and each Fund's shares"

"1532","statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act),"

"1537","beneficial interest, without par value, of each Fund, each"
"1538","outstanding share of which is, and each share of the Ultra-Short Fund"

"1540","fully paid, non-assessable, and has or will have full voting rights."
"1541","FCTFT currently issues shares of four series, including the Funds."
"1542","The Ultra-Short Fund currently is divided into two classes of shares:"
"1543","Class A1 and Advisor Class shares of beneficial interest of which Class"
"1544","A1 represent the Ultra-Short Fund Shares.  The Money Fund currently"
"1545","is comprised of one class of shares, Class A shares of beneficial"
"1546","interest.  No shareholder of either Fund shall have any option,"
"1547","warrant or preemptive right of subscription or purchase with"
"1548","respect to the Money Fund Shares or the Ultra-Short Fund Shares."
"1549","(c) The financial statements appearing in the Money Fund's Annual"
"1550","Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015,"
"1551","audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and any interim unaudited"
"1552","financial statements, fairly present the financial position of"
"1553","the Money Fund as of its respective dates and the results of"
"1554","the Money Fund's operations for periods indicated, in conformity"
"1555","with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applied on a"
"1556","consistent basis.  The Ultra-Short Fund will have no financial"
"1557","statements as of the Closing Date."
"1558","(d) The books and records of each Fund accurately summarize the"
"1559","accounting data represented and contain no material omissions with"

"1563","as amended, or By-laws, as amended, or any contract or any other"
"1564","commitment or obligation and is not subject to any order or decree"
"1565","that would be violated by its execution of or performance under the"
"1566","Plan, and no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court"

"1570","1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or as may otherwise be required under the"

"1573","commitments (other than the Plan or agreements for the purchase"

"1575","consistent with its obligations under the Plan) which will not be"

"1580","investment company (RIC) for federal income tax purposes"
"1581","under Part I of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,"
"1582","as amended (the Code).  The Money Fund is a fund as defined in"
"1583","Section 851(g)(2) of the Code.  The Money Fund has qualified as a"
"1584","RIC for each taxable year since its inception and that has ended"
"1585","prior to the Closing Date, and, will have satisfied the requirements"
"1586","of Part I of Subchapter M of the Code to maintain such qualification"

"1589","and profits accumulated in any taxable year to which the provisions"
"1590","of Subchapter M of the Code (or the corresponding provisions of prior law)"
"1591","did not apply.  Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the"
