"543","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT"
"544","REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING"
"545","FIRM"
"546","To the Shareholders and Board"
"547","of Trustees of OCM Gold Fund:"
"548","In planning and performing our"
"549","audit of the financial"
"550","statements of OCM Gold Fund"
"551","(the Fund), as of and for"
"552","the year ended November 30,"
"553","2010, in accordance with the"
"554","standards of the Public"
"555","Company Accounting Oversight"
"556","Board (United States), we"
"557","considered the Funds internal"
"558","control over financial"
"559","reporting, including controls"
"560","over safeguarding securities,"
"561","as a basis for designing our"
"562","auditing procedures for the"
"563","purpose of expressing our"
"564","opinion on the financial"
"565","statements and to comply with"
"566","the requirements of Form N-"
"567","SAR, but not for the purpose"
"568","of expressing an opinion on"
"569","the effectiveness of the"
"570","Funds internal control over"
"571","financial reporting."
"572","Accordingly, we express no"
"573","such opinion."
"574","The management of the Fund is"
"575","responsible for establishing"
"576","and maintaining effective"
"577","internal control over"
"578","financial reporting. In"
"579","fulfilling this"
"580","responsibility, estimates and"
"581","judgments by management are"
"582","required to assess the"
"583","expected benefits and related"
"584","costs of controls. A fund's"
"585","internal control over"
"586","financial reporting is a"
"587","process designed to provide"
"588","reasonable assurance regarding"
"589","the reliability of financial"
"590","reporting and the preparation"
"591","of financial statements for"
"592","external purposes in"
"593","accordance with generally"
"594","accepted accounting"
"595","principles. A fund's internal"
"596","control over financial"
"597","reporting includes those"
"598","policies and procedures that"
"599","(1) pertain to the maintenance"
"600","of records that, in reasonable"
"601","detail, accurately and fairly"
"602","reflect the transactions and"
"603","dispositions of the assets of"
"604","the fund; (2) provide"
"605","reasonable assurance that"
"606","transactions are recorded as"
"607","necessary to permit"
"608","preparation of financial"
"609","statements in accordance with"
"610","generally accepted accounting"
"611","principles, and that receipts"
"612","and expenditures of the fund"
"613","are being made only in"
"614","accordance with authorizations"
"615","of management and directors of"
"616","the fund; and (3) provide"
"617","reasonable assurance regarding"
"618","prevention or timely detection"
"619","of unauthorized acquisition,"
"620","use, or disposition of a"
"621","funds assets that could have"
"622","a material effect on the"
"623","financial statements."
"624","Because of its inherent"
"625","limitations, internal control"
"626","over financial reporting may"
"627","not prevent or detect"
"628","misstatements. Also,"
"629","projections of any evaluation"
"630","of effectiveness to future"
"631","periods are subject to the"
"632","risk that controls may become"
"633","inadequate because of changes"
"634","in conditions or that the"
"635","degree of compliance with the"
"636","policies or procedures may"
"637","deteriorate."
"638","A deficiency in internal"
"639","control over financial"
"640","reporting exists when the"
"641","design or operation of a"
"642","control does not allow"
"643","management or employees, in"
"644","the normal course of"
"645","performing their assigned"
"646","functions, to prevent or"
"647","detect misstatements on a"
"648","timely basis. A material"
"649","weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"650","combination of deficiencies,"
"651","in internal control over"
"652","financial reporting, such that"
"653","there is a reasonable"
"654","possibility that a material"
"655","misstatement of the funds"
"656","annual or interim financial"
"657","statements will not be"
"658","prevented or detected on a"
"659","timely basis."
"660","Our consideration of the"
"661","Funds internal control over"
"662","financial reporting was for"
"663","the limited purpose described"
"664","in the first paragraph and"
"665","would not necessarily disclose"
"666","all deficiencies in internal"
"667","control that might be material"
"668","weaknesses under standards"
"669","established by the Public"
"670","Company Accounting Oversight"
"671","Board (United States)."
"672","However, we noted no"
"673","deficiencies in the Funds"
"674","internal control over"
"675","financial reporting and its"
"676","operation, including controls"
"677","for safeguarding securities,"
"678","that we consider to be a"
"679","material weakness, as defined"
"680","above, as of November 30,"
"681","2010."
"682","This report is intended solely"
"683","for the information and use of"
"684","management and the Board of"
"685","Trustees of OCM Gold Fund. and"
"686","the Securities and Exchange"
"687","Commission and is not intended"
