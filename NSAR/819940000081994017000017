"687","Funds, Inc., as of and for the year ended November 30, 2016, in accordance with"
"688","the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"689","we considered the Funds&#8217; internal control over financial reporting, including"
"690","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"691","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"692","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"693","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#8217; internal"
"694","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</font></p>"

"697","of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"698","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"699","and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"700","related costs of controls. A fund&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting"
"701","is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability"
"702","of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"703","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A"
"704","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"705","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"706","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"707","assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"708","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"709","accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"710","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"711","fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"712","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets"
"713","that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</font></p>"

"715","<p style=margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;><font face=Times New Roman lang=EN-US style=font-size:11.0pt;>Because"
"716","of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not"
"717","prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"718","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"719","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"720","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </font></p>"

"725","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
