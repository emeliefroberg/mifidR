"805","<TEXT>"
"806","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"807","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors"
"808","Security Income Fund"
"809","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of the"
"810","Security Income Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year ended December 31,"
"811","2011, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"812","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds internal control over"
"813"," financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"814","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"815","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"816"," N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"817","of the Funds internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"818","express no such opinion."
"819","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"820","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"821","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"822","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A funds internal control"
"823","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"824","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"825","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"826","accepted accounting principles. A funds internal control over financial"
"827","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"828","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"829","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"830","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"831","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"832","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"833"," are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"834","directors of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"835","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"836","of a funds assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"837","statements."
"838","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"839","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation"
"840","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"841","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"842","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"843","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"844","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"845"," normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"846","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"847","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"848"," that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"849","funds annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"850"," on a timely basis."
"851","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting was"
"852","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"853","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"854","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"855","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"856"," in the Funds internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"857","including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"858","material weakness as defined above as of December 31, 2011."
"859","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"860","the Board of Directors of the Security Income Fund and the Securities and"
"861","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"862"," other than these specified parties."

"873","Guggenheim Transaction"
"874","On September 20, 2011, Guggenheim Capital, LLC agreed to purchase the indirect"
"875","holding company of Security Investors, LLC, the Funds investment manager"
"876","(the Investment Manager) (the Transaction). Guggenheim Capital, LLCs"
"877","subsidiary, Guggenheim Partners, LLC (Guggenheim), is a global, independent,"
"878","privately-held, diversified financial services firm with more than 1,500"
"879","dedicated professionals."
"880","The Transaction should not result in material changes to the day-to-day"
"881","management and operation of the Funds or any increase in fees. The parties"
"882","expect the Transaction to be completed in early 2012. However, it is subject to"
"883"," various conditions, and could be delayed or even terminated due to unforeseen"
"884","circumstances."
"885","In anticipation of the Transaction, the Board of Trustees of the Funds"
"886","(the Board) called a special meeting of shareholders (the Meeting), at"
"887","which shareholders of the Funds of record as of October 3, 2011 were asked to"
"888","consider the approval of a new investment management agreement between the"
"889","Funds and the Investment Manager (the New Agreement). This approval was"
"890","necessary because, under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act),"
"891","the Transaction could result in the termination of the Funds current"
"892","investment management agreement with the Investment Manager (the Current"
"893","Agreement). The Funds shareholders approved the New Agreement, the terms of"
"894"," which are substantially identical to the corresponding Current Agreement,"
"895","except with respect to the date of execution, and the New Agreement will take"
"896","effect if the Transaction is completed."
