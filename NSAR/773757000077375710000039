"1140","Columbia Funds Series Trust I - Annual N-SAR report for the"
"1141","period ending 4/30/10"
"1142","Columbia Core Bond Fund"
"1143"," (the Fund)"
"1144","77B Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1145","To the Trustees and Shareholders of Columbia Funds Series Trust I"
"1146","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"1147","Columbia Core Bond Fund (a series of Columbia Funds Series Trust I and"
"1148","hereafter referred to as the Fund) as of and for the year ended"
"1149","April 30, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1150","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's"
"1151","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1152","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1153","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1154","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not"
"1155","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1156","Fund's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"1157","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"1158","control over financial reporting."
"1159","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1160","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"1161","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"1162","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"1163","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"1164","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1165","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1166","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1167","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"1168","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"1169","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1170","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"1171","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"1172","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1173","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"1174","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"1175","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund;"
"1176","and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1177","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"1178","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1179","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1180","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"1181","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"1182","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1183","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1184","procedures may deteriorate."
"1185","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1186","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1187","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"1188","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"1189","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"1190","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1191","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's"
"1192","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1193","detected on a timely basis."
"1194","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1195","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"1196","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1197","control over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses"
"1198","under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"1199","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"1200","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1201","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be material"
"1202","weaknesses as defined above as of April 30, 2010."
"1203","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1204","management and the Board of Trustees of the Funds and the Securities"
"1205","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"
"1206","used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1246","Item 77E - Legal Proceedings:"
"1247","In June 2004, an action captioned John E. Gallus et al. v. American"
"1248","Express Financial Corp. and American Express Financial Advisors Inc."
"1249","was filed in the United States District Court for the District of"
"1250","Arizona. The plaintiffs allege that they are investors in several"
"1251","American Express Company (now known as RiverSource) mutual funds and"
"1252","they purport to bring the action derivatively on behalf of those funds"
"1253","under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The plaintiffs allege that"
"1254","fees allegedly paid to the defendants by the funds for investment"
"1255","advisory and administrative services are excessive. The plaintiffs"
"1256","seek remedies including restitution and rescission of investment"
"1257","advisory and distribution agreements. The plaintiffs voluntarily"
"1258","agreed to transfer this case to the United States District Court for"
"1259","the District of Minnesota (the District Court). In response to"
"1260","defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint, the District Court"
"1261","dismissed one of plaintiffs' four claims and granted plaintiffs"
"1262","limited discovery. Defendants moved for summary judgment in April 2007."
"1263","Summary judgment was granted in the defendants' favor on July 9, 2007."
"1264","The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Eighth Circuit Court"
"1265","of Appeals (the Eighth Circuit) on August 8, 2007. On April 8, 2009,"
"1266","the Eighth Circuit reversed summary judgment and remanded to the"
"1267","District Court for further proceedings. On August 6, 2009, defendants"
"1268","filed a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court (the Supreme"
"1269","Court), asking the Supreme Court to stay the District Court proceedings"
"1270","while the Supreme Court considers and rules in a case captioned Jones v."
"1271","Harris Associates, which involves issues of law similar to those"
"1272","presented in the Gallus case. On March 30, 2010, the Supreme Court"
"1273","issued its ruling in Jones v. Harris Associates, and on April 5, 2010,"
"1274","the Supreme Court vacated the Eighth Circuit's decision in the Gallus"
"1275","case and remanded the case to the Eighth Circuit for further"
"1276","consideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Jones v."
"1277","Harris Associates."
"1278","In December 2005, without admitting or denying the allegations, American"
"1279","Express Financial Corporation (AEFC, which is now known as Ameriprise"
"1280","Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise Financial)), entered into settlement"
"1281","agreements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and"
"1282","Minnesota Department of Commerce (MDOC) related to market timing"
"1283","activities. As a result, AEFC was censured and ordered to cease and"
"1284","desist from committing or causing any violations of certain provisions"
"1285","of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of"
"1286","1940, and various Minnesota laws. AEFC agreed to pay disgorgement of"
"1287","$10 million and civil money penalties of $7 million. AEFC also agreed"
"1288","to retain an independent distribution consultant to assist in"
"1289","developing a plan for distribution of all disgorgement and civil"
"1290","penalties ordered by the SEC in accordance with various undertakings"
"1291","detailed at http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/ia-2451.pdf. Ameriprise"
"1292","Financial and its affiliates have cooperated with the SEC and the MDOC"
"1293","in these legal proceedings, and have made regular reports to the"
"1294","RiverSource Funds' Boards of Directors/Trustees."
"1295","Ameriprise Financial and certain of its affiliates have historically"
"1296","been involved in a number of legal, arbitration and regulatory"
"1297","proceedings, including routine litigation, class actions, and"
"1298","governmental actions, concerning matters arising in connection with"
"1299","the conduct of their business activities. Ameriprise Financial believes"
"1300","that the Funds are not currently the subject of, and that neither"
"1301","Ameriprise Financial nor any of its affiliates are the subject of, any"
"1302","pending legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings that are likely to"
"1303","have a material adverse effect on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise"
"1304","Financial or its affiliates to perform under their contracts with the"
"1305","Funds. Ameriprise Financial is required to make 10-Q, 10-K and, as"
"1306","necessary, 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on"
"1307","legal and regulatory matters that relate to Ameriprise Financial and its"
"1308","affiliates. Copies of these filings may be obtained by accessing the"
"1309","SEC website at www.sec.gov."
"1310","There can be no assurance that these matters, or the adverse publicity"
"1311","associated with them, will not result in increased fund redemptions,"
"1312","reduced sale of fund shares or other adverse consequences to the Funds."
"1313","Further, although we believe proceedings are not likely to have a"
"1314","material adverse effect on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise"
"1315","Financial or its affiliates to perform under their contracts with the"
"1316","Funds, these proceedings are subject to uncertainties and, as such, we"
"1317","are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may result."
"1318","An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could result in"
"1319","adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other relief that"
"1320","could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial"
"1321","condition or results of operations of Ameriprise Financial."
