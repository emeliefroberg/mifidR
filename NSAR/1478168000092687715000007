"1224","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1225","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1226","Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Funds Trust"
"1227","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1228","statements of Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Funds Trust"
"1229","comprising Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Select 40 Fund,"
"1230","Oppenheimer SteelPath MLP Alpha Fund, Oppenheimer"
"1231","SteelPath MLP Income Fund, and Oppenheimer SteelPath"
"1232","MLP Alpha Plus Fund (the Funds), as of and for the year"
"1233","ended November 28, 2014, in accordance with the standards"
"1234","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1235","(United States), we considered the Funds internal control"
"1236","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1237","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1238","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"1239","opinion on"
"1240","the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1241","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1242","expressing"
"1243","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"1244","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no"
"1245","such opinion."
"1246","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"1247","and maintaining effective internal control over"
"1248","financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"1249","estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1250","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"1251","funds internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"1252","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1253","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1254","financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"1255","with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A"
"1256","funds internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1257","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1258","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1259","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions"
"1260","of"
"1261","the assets of the fund (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"1262","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1263","preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP,"
"1264","and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"1265","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"1266","and trustees of the fund and (3) provide"
"1267","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"1268","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"1269","funds assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1270","statements."
"1271","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1272","financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1273","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1274","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"1275","that"
"1276","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"1277","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1278","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1279","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1280","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1281","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1282","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1283","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1284","deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1285","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1286","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"1287","the Funds"
"1288","annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1289","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1290","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"1291","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the"
"1292","first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"1293","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"1294","weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"1295","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"1296","However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"1297","control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1298","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"1299","to be a material weakness as defined above as of November"
"1300","28, 2014."
"1301","This report is intended solely for the information and use"
"1302","of management and the Board of Trustees of the Funds"
"1303","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"1304","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"1305","than these specified parties."

"1315","<DESCRIPTION>STEELPATH FUNDS MLP TRUST NSAR-B LITIGATION"
"1316","<TEXT>"
"1317","Pending Litigation.  In 2009, seven class action lawsuits"
"1318","were filed in the U.S. District Court for"
"1319","the District of Colorado against OppenheimerFunds, Inc."
"1320","(OFI), OppenheimerFunds Distributor,"
"1321","Inc., the Funds principal underwriter and distributor"
"1322","(the Distributor), and certain funds (but not"
"1323","including the Fund) advised by OFI Global Asset Management,"
"1324","Inc. and distributed by the"
"1325","Distributor (the Defendant Funds).  The lawsuits also"
"1326","named as defendants certain officers and"
"1327","current and former trustees of the respective Defendant"
"1328","Funds.  The lawsuits raised claims under"
"1329","federal securities laws and alleged, among other things,"
"1330","that the disclosure documents of the"
"1331","respective Defendant Funds contained misrepresentations"
"1332","and omissions and that the respective"
"1333","Defendant Funds investment policies were not followed."
"1334","The plaintiffs in these actions sought"
"1335","unspecified damages, equitable relief and awards of"
"1336","attorneys fees and litigation expenses.  The"
"1337","Defendant Funds Boards of Trustees also engaged counsel"
"1338","to represent the Funds and the"
"1339","present and former Independent Trustees named in those"
"1340","suits.  In March 2014, the parties in six"
"1341","of these lawsuits executed stipulations and agreements of"
"1342","settlement resolving those actions.  In"
"1343","July 2014, the court entered an order and final judgment"
"1344","approving the settlements as fair,"
"1345","reasonable and adequate. The settlements do not resolve a"
"1346","seventh outstanding lawsuit relating to"
"1347","Oppenheimer Rochester California Municipal Fund (the"
"1348","California Fund Suit). OFI believes the"
"1349","California Fund Suit is without legal merit and is defending"
"1350","the suit vigorously.  While it is"
"1351","premature to render any opinion as to the outcome in the"
"1352","California Fund Suit, or whether any"
"1353","costs that OFI may bear in defending the California Fund"
"1354","Suit might not be reimbursed by"
"1355","insurance, OFI believes the California Fund Suit should"
"1356","not impair the ability of OFI or the"
"1357","Distributor to perform their respective duties to the Fund,"
"1358","and that the outcome of the California"
"1359","Fund Suit should not have any material effect on the"
"1360","operations of any of the Oppenheimer"
"1361","Funds."
