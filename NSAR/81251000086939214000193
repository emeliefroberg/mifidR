"569","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"570","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"571","Putnam Global Equity Fund:"
"572","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"573","of Putnam Global Equity Fund ( the Fund ) as of and for the year"
"574","ended October 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the"
"575","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"576","considered the Fund s internal control over financial reporting,"
"577","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"578","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"579","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"580","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"581","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund s internal control"
"582","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such"
"583","opinion."
"584","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"585","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"586","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"587","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"588","related costs of controls.  A company s internal control over"
"589","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"590","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"591","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"592","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."
"593","A company s internal control over financial reporting includes"
"594","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"595","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"596","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"597","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"598","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"599","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"600","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"601","with authorizations of management and trustees of the company;"
"602","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"603","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"604","of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the"
"605","financial statements."
"606","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"607","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"608","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"609","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"610","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"611","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"612","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"613","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"614","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"615","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"616","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"617","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"618","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"619","material misstatement of a fund s annual or interim financial"
"620","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"621","Our consideration of the Fund s internal control over financial"
"622","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"623","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"624","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"625","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"626","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"627","Fund s internal control over financial reporting and its"
"628","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that"
"629","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"630","October 31, 2014."
"631","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"632","management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam Global Equity Fund"
"633","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to"
"634","be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"635","parties."

"690","be subject to the Agreement and Declaration of Trust, as from"
"691","time to time in effect (the  Declaration of Trust ), of the"
"692","Massachusetts business trust established by the Declaration of"

"701","ARTICLE 2"
"702","Meetings of Trustees"
"703","      2.1  Regular Meetings.  Regular meetings of the Trustees may"
"704","be held without call or notice at such places and at such times"
"705","as the Trustees may from time to time determine, provided that"
"706","notice of the first regular meeting following any such"
"707","determination shall be given to absent Trustees."
"708","      2.2  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Trustees may"
"709","be held at any time and at any place designated in the call of"
"710","the meeting when called by the Chair of the Trustees, the"
"711","President, the Executive Vice President or the Treasurer or by"
"712","two or more Trustees, sufficient notice thereof being given to"
"713","each Trustee by the Clerk or an Assistant Clerk or by the officer"
"714","or the Trustees calling the meeting."
"715","      2.3  Notice of Special Meetings.  It shall be sufficient"
"716","notice to a Trustee of a special meeting: (a) to send notice (i)"
"717","by mail at least forty-eight hours before the meeting, (ii) by"
"718","courier at least forty-eight hours before the meeting, (iii) by"
"719","electronic mail (e-mail), facsimile or other electronic means at"

"721","addressed to the Trustee at his or her usual or last known"
"722","business or residence address (or e-mail address, facsimile"
"723","number or other appropriate address); or (b) to give notice to"
"724","him or her in person or by telephone at least twenty-four hours"
"725","before the meeting.  Notice of a special meeting need not be"

"727","him or her before or after the meeting, is filed with the records"
"728","of the meeting, or to any Trustee who attends the meeting without"
"729","protesting before or at its commencement the lack of notice to"
"730","him or her.  Any written waiver of notice may be provided and"
"731","delivered to the Trust by mail, courier, e-mail, facsimile or"
"732","other electronic means. Neither notice of a meeting nor a waiver"

"743","otherwise provided in the Declaration of Trust and these Bylaws,"
"744","any action to be taken by the Trustees may be taken by a majority"
"745","of the Trustees present at the meeting of the Trustees (a quorum"
"746","being present), including any meeting held by means of a"
"747","conference telephone or other communications equipment by means"
"748","of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each"
"749","other at the same time and participation by such means shall"
"750","constitute presence in person at a meeting. Any action to be"
"751","taken by the Trustees may also be taken without a meeting if one"
"752","or more written consents thereto are signed by a majority of the"
"753","Trustees.  Any written consent may be given by mail, courier, e-"
"754","mail, facsimile or other electronic means.  Copies of such"
"755","written consents shall be filed with the minutes of the"
"756","proceedings of the Trustees.  Such consents shall be treated for"

"1231","identified on Schedule A the management of which is allocated"

"1256","Sub Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain for the related"
"1257","Fund the most favorable price and execution available, except to"
"1258","the extent it may be permitted to pay higher brokerage"
"1259","commissions for brokerage and research services as described"
"1260","below. In using its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the most"

"1263","factors it deems relevant, including by way of illustration,"
"1264","price, the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for"
"1265","the security, the amount of the commission, the timing of the"
"1266","transaction taking into account market prices and trends, the"
"1267","reputation, experience and financial stability of the broker or"
"1268","dealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the broker"
"1269","or dealer in other transactions. Subject to such policies as the"
"1270","Trustees of the Funds may determine, the Sub Advisor shall not be"

"1274","brokerage and research services to the Manager or, in the case of"
"1275","a PIL Advised Sleeve, PIL, or the Sub Advisor an amount of"
"1276","commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in"
"1277","excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would"
"1278","have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Sub Advisor"
"1279","determines in good faith that such amount of commission was"
"1280","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research"
"1281","services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in terms of"
"1282","either that particular transaction or its overall"
"1283","responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to other clients of"
"1284","the Manager or PIL, as the case may be, or the Sub Advisor as to"
"1285","which the Manager or PIL, as the case may be, or the Sub Advisor"
"1286","exercises investment discretion. The Sub Advisor agrees that in"

"1580","      WHEREAS, the Manager desires to engage the Sub Manager from"
"1581","time to time to manage a portion of certain of the Funds:"
"1582","      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants"
"1583","herein contained, it is agreed as follows:"
"1584","1.	SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY SUB MANAGER."
"1585","      (a)	The Sub Manager, at its expense, will furnish"
"1586","continuously an investment program for that portion of any Fund"
"1587","the management of which is allocated from time to time by the"
"1588","Manager to the Sub Manager (an  Allocated Sleeve ). The Manager"
"1589","shall, in its sole discretion, determine which Funds will have an"
"1590","Allocated Sleeve and the amount of assets allocated from time to"
"1591","time to each such Allocated Sleeve; provided that, with respect"
"1592","to any Fund, the Trustees of such Fund must have approved the use"
"1593","of the Sub Manager prior to the creation of an Allocated Sleeve"
"1594","for such Fund. The Sub Manager will determine what investments"
"1595","shall be purchased, held, sold or exchanged by any Allocated"
"1596","Sleeve and what portion, if any, of the assets of the Allocated"
"1597","Sleeve shall be held uninvested and shall, on behalf of the Fund,"
"1598","make changes in the Funds investments held in such Allocated"
"1599","Sleeve."
"1600","      (b)	The Manager may also, at its discretion, request the"
"1601","Sub Manager to provide assistance with purchasing and selling"
"1602","securities for any Fund, including the placement of orders with"
"1603","broker dealers selected in accordance with Section 1(d), even if"
"1604","the Manager has not established an Allocated Sleeve for such"
"1605","Fund."
"1606","      (c)	The Sub Manager at its expense will furnish all"
"1607","necessary investment and management facilities, including"
"1608","salaries of personnel, required for it to execute its duties"
"1609","faithfully."
"1610","      (d)	The Sub Manager shall place all orders for the purchase"
"1611","and sale of portfolio investments for any Allocated Sleeve with"
"1612","brokers or dealers selected by the Sub Manager. In the selection"
"1613","of such brokers or dealers and the placing of such orders, the"
"1614","Sub Manager shall use its best efforts to obtain for the related"
"1615","Fund the most favorable price and execution available, except to"
"1616","the extent it may be permitted to pay higher brokerage"
"1617","commissions for brokerage and research services as described"
"1618","below. In using its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the most"
"1619","favorable price and execution available, the Sub Manager, bearing"
"1620","in mind the Funds best interests at all times, shall consider all"
"1621","factors it deems relevant, including by way of illustration,"
"1622","price, the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for"
"1623","the security, the amount of the commission, the timing of the"
"1624","transaction taking into account market prices and trends, the"
"1625","reputation, experience and financial stability of the broker or"
"1626","dealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the broker"
"1627","or dealer in other transactions. Subject to such policies as the"
"1628","Trustees of the Funds may determine, the Sub Manager shall not be"
"1629","deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty"
"1630","created by this Contract or otherwise solely by reason of its"
"1631","having caused a Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides"
"1632","brokerage and research services to the Manager or the Sub Manager"
"1633","an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"1634","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker"
"1635","or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if"
"1636","the Sub Manager determines in good faith that such amount of"
"1637","commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"1638","brokerage and research services provided by such broker or"
"1639","dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"1640","its overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to"
"1641","other clients of the Manager or the Sub Manager as to which the"
"1642","Manager or the Sub Manager exercises investment discretion. The"
"1643","Sub Manager agrees that in connection with purchases or sales of"
"1644","portfolio investments for any Fund, neither the Sub Manager nor"
"1645","any officer, director, employee or agent of the Sub Manager shall"
"1646","act as a principal or receive any commission other than as"
"1647","provided in Section 3."
"1648","      (e)	The Sub Manager shall not be obligated to pay any"
"1649","expenses of or for the Manager or any Fund not expressly assumed"
"1650","by the Sub Manager pursuant to this Section 1."
"1651","      (f)	In the performance of its duties, the Sub Manager will"
"1652","comply with the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of"
"1653","Trust and By Laws of each applicable Fund and such Funds stated"
"1654","investment objectives, policies and restrictions, and will use"
"1655","its best efforts to safeguard and promote the welfare of such"
"1656","Fund and to comply with other policies which the Manager or the"
"1657","Trustees may from time to time determine and shall exercise the"
"1658","same care and diligence expected of the Manager."
"1659","2.	OTHER AGREEMENTS, ETC."
"1660","      It is understood that any of the shareholders, Trustees,"
"1661","officers and employees of a Fund may be a shareholder, director,"
"1662","officer or employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the Sub"
"1663","Manager, and in any person controlled by or under common control"
"1664","with the Sub Manager, and that the Sub Manager and any person"
"1665","controlled by or under common control with the Sub Manager may"
"1666","have an interest in such Fund. It is also understood that the Sub"
"1667","Manager and any person controlled by or under common control with"
"1668","the Sub Manager have and may have advisory, management, service"
"1669","or other contracts with other organizations and persons, and may"
"1670","have other interests and business."
"1671","3.	COMPENSATION."
"1672","      Except as provided below, the Manager will pay to the Sub"
"1673","Manager as compensation for the Sub Managers services rendered, a"
"1674","fee, computed and paid quarterly at the annual rate of 0.35% per"
"1675","annum of average aggregate net asset value of the assets in"
"1676","equity and asset allocation Allocated Sleeves and 0.40% per annum"
"1677","of average aggregate net asset value of the assets in fixed"
"1678","income Allocated Sleeves, except for fixed income Allocated"
"1679","Sleeves in certain fixed income Funds enumerated as follows (with"
"1680","the per annum fee provided in parentheses): Putnam Money Market"
"1681","Liquidity Fund (0.20%), Putnam Short Term Investment Fund"
"1682","(0.20%), Putnam Money Market Fund (0.25%), Putnam Tax Exempt"
"1683","Money Market Fund (0.25%), Putnam VT Money Market Fund (0.25%),"
"1684","Putnam Short Duration Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam Short Term"
"1685","Municipal Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam American Government Income"
"1686","Fund (0.25%), Putnam Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam U.S. Government"
"1687","Income Trust (0.25%), Putnam VT American Government Income Fund"
"1688","(0.25%), and Putnam VT Income Fund (0.25%)."
"1689","      Such average net asset value shall be determined by taking"
"1690","an average of all of the determinations of such net asset value"
"1691","during a quarter at the close of business on each business day"
"1692","during such quarter while this Contract is in effect. Such fee"
"1693","shall be payable for each quarter within 30 days after the close"
"1694","of such quarter. The Sub Manager shall look only to the Manager"
"1695","for payment of its fees. No Fund shall have any responsibility"
"1696","for paying any fees due the Sub Manager."
"1697","      With respect to each of Putnam High Income Securities Fund,"
"1698","Putnam Master Intermediate Income Trust and Putnam Premier Income"
"1699","Trust, the Manager will pay to the Sub Manager as compensation"
"1700","for the Sub Managers services rendered, a fee, computed and paid"
"1701","quarterly at the annual rate of 0.40% of Average Weekly Assets in"
"1702","Allocated Sleeves.  Average Weekly Assets  means the average of"
"1703","the weekly determinations of the difference between the total"
"1704","assets of the Fund (including any assets attributable to leverage"
"1705","for investment purposes) attributable to an Allocated Sleeve and"
"1706","the total liabilities of the Fund (excluding liabilities incurred"
"1707","in connection with leverage for investment purposes) attributable"
"1708","to such Allocated Sleeve, determined at the close of the last"
"1709","business day of each week, for each week which ends during the"
"1710","quarter. Such fee shall be payable for each quarter within 30"
"1711","days after the close of such quarter. As used in this Section 3,"
"1712","leverage for investment purposes  means any incurrence of"
"1713","indebtedness the proceeds of which are to be invested in"
"1714","accordance with the Funds investment objective. For purposes of"
"1715","calculating Average Weekly Assets, liabilities associated with"
"1716","any instruments or transactions used to leverage the Funds"
"1717","portfolio for investment purposes (whether or not such"
"1718","instruments or transactions are  covered  within the meaning of"
"1719","the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and regulations"
"1720","thereunder, giving effect to any interpretations of the"
"1721","Securities and Exchange Commission and its staff) are not"
"1722","considered liabilities. For purposes of calculating Average"
"1723","Weekly Assets, the total assets of the Fund will be deemed to"
"1724","include (a) any proceeds from the sale or transfer of an asset"
"1725","(the  Underlying Asset ) of the Fund to a counterparty in a"
"1726","reverse repurchase or dollar roll transaction and (b) the value"
"1727","of such Underlying Asset as of the relevant measuring date."
"1728","      In the event that the Managers management fee from any of"
"1729","Putnam High Income Securities Fund, Putnam Master Intermediate"
"1730","Income Trust or Putnam Premier Income Trust is reduced pursuant"
"1731","to the investment management contract between such Fund and the"
"1732","Manager because during any Measurement Period (as defined below)"
"1733","the amount of interest payments and fees with respect to"
"1734","indebtedness or other obligation of the Fund incurred for"
"1735","investment leverage purposes, plus additional expenses"
"1736","attributable to any such leverage for investment purposes,"
"1737","exceeds the portion of the Funds net income and net short term"
"1738","capital gains (but not long term capital gains) accruing during"
"1739","such Measurement Period as a result of the fact that such"
"1740","indebtedness or other obligation was outstanding during the"
"1741","Measurement Period, the fee payable to  the Sub Manager with"
"1742","respect to such Fund shall be reduced in the same proportion as"
"1743","the fee paid to the Manager with respect to such Fund is so"
"1744","reduced.  Measurement Period  shall be any period for which"
"1745","payments of interest or fees (whether designated as such or"
"1746","implied) are payable in connection with any indebtedness or other"
"1747","obligation of the Fund incurred for investment purposes."
"1748","      If the Sub Manager shall serve for less than the whole of a"
"1749","quarter, the foregoing compensation shall be prorated."
"1750","4.	ASSIGNMENT TERMINATES THIS CONTRACT; AMENDMENTS OF THIS"
"1751","CONTRACT."
"1752","      This Contract shall automatically terminate without the"
"1753","payment of any penalty, in the event of its assignment; and this"
"1754","Contract shall not be amended with respect to any Allocated"
"1755","Sleeve unless such amendment be approved at a meeting by the"
"1756","vote, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of"
"1757","voting on such approval, of a majority of the Trustees of the"
"1758","related Fund who are not interested persons of such Fund or of"
"1759","the Manager."
"1760","5.	EFFECTIVE PERIOD AND TERMINATION OF THIS CONTRACT."
"1761","      This Contract shall become effective upon its execution, and"
"1762","shall remain in full force and effect continuously thereafter"
"1763","(unless terminated automatically as set forth in Section 4) until"
"1764","terminated as follows:"
"1765","      (a)	Either party hereto or, with respect to any Allocated"
"1766","Sleeve, the related Fund may at any time terminate this Contract"
"1767","by not more than sixty days nor less than thirty days written"
"1768","notice delivered or mailed by registered mail, postage prepaid,"
"1769","to the other party, or"
"1770","      (b)	With respect to any Allocated Sleeve, if (i) the"
"1771","Trustees of the related Fund or the shareholders by the"
"1772","affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of such"
"1773","Fund, and (ii) a majority of the Trustees of such Fund who are"

"1775","cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on"
"1776","such approval, do not specifically approve at least annually the"
"1777","continuance of this Contract, then this Contract shall"
"1778","automatically terminate at the close of business on the"
"1779","anniversary of its execution, or upon the expiration of one year"
"1780","from the effective date of the last such continuance, whichever"
"1781","is later, or"
"1782","      (c)	With respect to any Allocated Sleeve, automatically"
"1783","upon termination of the Managers investment management contract"
"1784","with the related Fund."

"2136","Ownership of Shares"
"2137","      Section 2.	The ownership of Shares shall be recorded on the"
"2138","books of the Trust or a transfer or similar agent.  No"
"2139","certificates certifying the ownership of Shares shall be issued"

"2141","The Trustees may make such rules as they consider appropriate for"
"2142","the issuance of Share certificates, the retirement of Share"
"2143","certificates, the transfer of Shares and similar matters.  The"
"2144","record books of the Trust as kept by the Trust or any transfer or"
"2145","similar agent, as the case may be, shall be conclusive as to who"
"2146","are the Shareholders of each series and class and as to the"

"2181","the Shareholder to any title in or to the whole or any part of"
"2182","the Trust property or right to call for a partition or division"
"2183","of the same or for an accounting, nor shall the ownership of"

"2424","ARTICLE V"
"2425","Shareholders Voting Powers and Meetings"
"2426","Voting Powers"
"2427","      Section 1.	Subject to the voting powers of one or more classes"
"2428","of Shares as set forth elsewhere in this Declaration of Trust or"
"2429","in the Bylaws, the Shareholders shall have power to vote only (i)"
"2430","for the election of Trustees as provided in Article IV, Section"
"2431","1, (ii) for the removal of Trustees as provided in Article IV,"
"2432","Section 2, (iii) with respect to any Manager as provided in"
"2433","Article IV, Section 6, (iv) with respect to any termination of"
"2434","this Trust to the extent and as provided in Article IX, Section"
"2435","4, (v) with respect to any amendment of this Declaration of Trust"
"2436","to the extent and as provided in Article IX, Section 8, and (vi)"
"2437","with respect to such additional matters relating to the Trust as"
"2438","may be required by this Declaration of Trust, the Bylaws or any"
"2439","registration of the Trust with the Securities and Exchange"
"2440","Commission (or any successor agency) or any state, or as the"
"2441","Trustees may consider necessary or desirable.  Each whole Share"
"2442","shall be entitled to one vote as to any matter on which it is"
"2443","entitled to vote and each fractional Share shall be entitled to a"
"2444","proportionate fractional vote.  On any matter submitted to a vote"
"2445","of Shareholders, all Shares of the Trust then entitled to vote"
"2446","shall, except as otherwise provided in the Bylaws, be voted in"
"2447","the aggregate as a single class without regard to series or"
"2448","classes of shares, except (1) when required by the 1940 Act or"
"2449","when the Trustees shall have determined that the matter affects"
"2450","one or more series or classes of Shares materially differently,"
"2451","Shares shall be voted by individual series or class; and (2) when"
"2452","the Trustees have determined that the matter affects only the"
"2453","interests of one or more series or classes, only Shareholders of"
"2454","such series or classes shall be entitled to vote thereon.  There"
"2455","shall be no cumulative voting in the election of Trustees."
"2456","Shares may be voted in person or by proxy.  A proxy with respect"
"2457","to Shares held in the name of two or more persons shall be valid"
"2458","if executed by any one of them unless at or prior to exercise of"
"2459","the proxy the Trust receives a specific written notice to the"
"2460","contrary from any one of them.  A proxy purporting to be executed"
"2461","by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless"
"2462","challenged at or prior to its exercise and, in the case of a"

"2465","any series or class are issued, the Trustees may exercise all"
"2466","rights of Shareholders and may take any action required by law,"
"2467","this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws to be taken by"

"2473","authority of the Shareholders of such series or classes as herein"
"2474","provided or upon any other matter deemed by the Trustees to be"
"2475","necessary or desirable.  Written notice of any meeting of"
"2476","Shareholders shall be given or caused to be given by the Trustees"
"2477","by mailing such notice at least seven days before such meeting,"
"2478","postage prepaid, stating the time, place and purpose of the"
"2479","meeting, to each Shareholder entitled to vote at such meeting at"
"2480","the Shareholders address as it appears on the records of the"
"2481","Trust.  If the Trustees shall fail to call or give notice of any"
"2482","meeting of Shareholders for a period of 30 days after written"
"2483","application by Shareholders holding at least 10% of the then"
"2484","outstanding shares of all series and classes entitled to vote at"
"2485","such meeting requesting a meeting to be called for a purpose"
"2486","requiring action by the Shareholders as provided herein or in the"
"2487","Bylaws, then Shareholders holding at least 10% of the then"
"2488","outstanding Shares of all series and classes entitled to vote at"
"2489","such meeting may call and give notice of such meeting, and"
"2490","thereupon the meeting shall be held in the manner provided for"
"2491","herein in case of call thereof by the Trustees.  Notice of a"
"2492","meeting need not be given to any Shareholder if a written waiver"
"2493","of notice, executed by him or her before or after the meeting, is"

"2496","commencement the lack of notice to him or her."
"2497","Quorum and Required Vote"
"2498","      Section 3.	Thirty percent of Shares entitled to vote on a"
"2499","particular matter shall be a quorum for the transaction of"
"2500","business on that matter at a Shareholders meeting, except that"
"2501","where any provision of law or of this Declaration of Trust or the"
"2502","Bylaws requires that holders of any series or class shall vote as"
"2503","an individual series or class, then thirty percent of the"
"2504","aggregate number of Shares of that series or class entitled to"
"2505","vote shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the"
"2506","transaction of business by that series or class.  Any lesser"
"2507","number shall be sufficient for adjournments.  Any adjourned"
"2508","session or sessions may be held, within a reasonable time after"
"2509","the date set for the original meeting, without the necessity of"
"2510","further notice.  Except when a larger vote is required by any"
"2511","provision of law or of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws, a"
"2512","majority of the Shares voted shall decide any questions and a"
"2513","plurality shall elect a Trustee, provided that where any"
"2514","provision of law or of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws"
"2515","requires that the holders of any series or class shall vote as an"
"2516","individual series or class then a majority of the Shares of that"
"2517","series or class voted on the matter (or a plurality with respect"
"2518","to the election of a Trustee) shall decide that matter insofar as"
"2519","that series or class is concerned."
"2520","Action by Written Consent"
"2521","      Section 4.	Any action taken by Shareholders may be taken"
"2522","without a meeting if a majority of Shareholders entitled to vote"
"2523","on the matter (or such larger proportion thereof as shall be"
"2524","required by any express provision of this Declaration of Trust or"
"2525","the Bylaws) consent to the action in writing and such written"
"2526","consents are filed with the records of the meetings of"
"2527","Shareholders.  Such consent shall be treated for all purposes as"
"2528","a vote taken at a meeting of Shareholders."
"2529","Additional Provisions"
"2530","      Section 5.	The Bylaws may include further provisions, not"
"2531","inconsistent with this Declaration of Trust, regarding"
"2532","Shareholders voting powers, the conduct of meetings and related"
"2533","matters."
"2534","ARTICLE VI"
"2535","Distributions, Redemptions and Repurchases"
"2536","Distributions"
"2537","      Section 1.	The Trustees may each year, or more frequently if"
"2538","they so determine, distribute to the Shareholders of each series"
"2539","out of the assets of such series such amounts as the Trustees may"
"2540","determine.  Any such distribution to the Shareholders of a"
"2541","particular series shall be made to said Shareholders pro rata in"
"2542","proportion to the number of Shares of such series held by each of"
"2543","them, except to the extent otherwise required or permitted by the"
"2544","preferences and special or relative rights and privileges of any"
"2545","classes of Shares of that Series, and any distribution to the"
"2546","Shareholders of a particular class of Shares shall be made to"
"2547","such Shareholders pro rata in proportion to the number of Shares"
"2548","of such class held by each of them.  Such distributions shall be"
"2549","made in cash, Shares or other property, or a combination thereof,"
"2550","as determined by the Trustees.  Any such distribution paid in"
"2551","Shares will be paid at the net asset value thereof as determined"
"2552","in accordance with the Bylaws."
"2553","Redemptions and Repurchases"
"2554","      Section 2.	The Trust shall purchase such Shares as are offered"
"2555","by any Shareholder for redemption, upon the presentation of any"
"2556","certificate for the Shares to be purchased, a proper instrument"
"2557","of transfer and a request directed to the Trust or a person"
"2558","designated by the Trust that the Trust purchase such Shares, or"
"2559","in accordance with such other procedures for redemption as the"
"2560","Trustees may from time to time authorize; and the Trust will pay"
"2561","therefor the net asset value thereof, as next determined in"
"2562","accordance with the Bylaws, less any redemption charge fixed by"
"2563","the Trustees.  Payment for said Shares shall be made by the Trust"
"2564","to the Shareholder within seven days after the date on which the"
"2565","request is made.  The obligation set forth in this Section 2 is"
"2566","subject to the provision that in the event that at any time the"
"2567","New York Stock Exchange is closed for other than customary"
"2568","weekends or holidays, or, if permitted by rules of the Securities"
"2569","and Exchange Commission, during periods when trading on the"
"2570","Exchange is restricted or during any emergency which makes it"
"2571","impractical for the Trust to dispose of its investments or to"
"2572","determine fairly the value of its net assets, or during any other"
"2573","period permitted by order of the Securities and Exchange"
"2574","Commission for the protection of investors, such obligation may"
"2575","be suspended or postponed by the Trustees.  The Trust may also"
"2576","purchase or repurchase Shares at a price not exceeding the net"
"2577","asset value of such Shares in effect when the purchase or"
"2578","repurchase or any contract to purchase or repurchase is made."
"2579","Payment for any redemption, purchase or repurchase may be made in"
"2580","cash or, except to the extent prohibited by the laws of any"
"2581","jurisdiction in which Shares are registered for sale, in other"
"2582","property, or any combination thereof.  The composition of any"
"2583","such payment shall be determined by the Trust in its sole"
"2584","discretion, and the Trust shall have no obligation to effect a"
"2585","pro rata division of cash or other property in making any such"
"2586","payment.  In no event shall the Trust be liable for any delay of"
"2587","any other person in transferring securities or other property"
"2588","selected for delivery as all or part of any such payment."
"2589","Redemption at the Option of the Trust"
"2590","      Section 3.	The Trust shall have the right at its option and at"
"2591","any time to redeem Shares of any Shareholder at the net asset"
"2592","value thereof as determined in accordance with the Bylaws: (i) if"
"2593","at such time such Shareholder owns fewer Shares than, or Shares"
"2594","having an aggregate net asset value of less than, an amount"
"2595","determined from time to time by the Trustees, in which case the"
"2596","Trust may redeem all Shares owned by such Shareholder or only so"
"2597","many of such Shares as may be required to compensate the Trust"
"2598","for any fee fixed from time to time by the Trustees for the"
"2599","maintenance of small accounts; (ii) to the extent that such"
"2600","Shareholder owns Shares of a particular series of Shares equal to"
"2601","or in excess of a percentage of the outstanding Shares of that"
"2602","series determined from time to time by the Trustees; (iii) to the"
"2603","extent that such Shareholder owns Shares of the Trust"
"2604","representing a percentage equal to or in excess of such"
"2605","percentage of the aggregate number of outstanding Shares of the"
"2606","Trust or the aggregate net asset value of the Trust determined"
"2607","from time to time by the Trustees; (iv) if such Shareholder fails"
"2608","to supply appropriate personal and tax identification information"
"2609","requested by the Trust; (v) if such Shareholder fails to meet or"
"2610","maintain the qualifications for ownership of a particular series"
"2611","or class; or (vi) if the Trustees determine for any other reason,"
"2612","in their sole discretion, that the ownership of Shares by a"
"2613","Shareholder is not in the best interests of the remaining"
"2614","Shareholders of the Trust or of the applicable series or class."

"2668","otherwise or with which such Covered Person may be or may have"
"2669","been threatened, while in office or thereafter, by reason of"

"2671","any matter as to which such Covered Person shall have been"
"2672","finally adjudicated in any such action, suit or other proceeding"
"2673","(a) not to have acted in good faith, (b) not to have acted in the"

"2680","negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the"
"2681","conduct of such Covered Persons office (each of such exceptions"

"2689","Trust if it is ultimately determined that indemnification of such"

"2691","that either (a) such Covered Person shall have provided"
"2692","appropriate security for such undertaking, (b) the Trust shall be"

"2698","of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial type"
"2699","inquiry) that there is reason to believe that such Covered Person"
"2700","will be found entitled to indemnification under this Article. In"
"2701","making any such determination, the disinterested Trustees or such"
"2702","counsel, as the case may be, shall afford the Covered Person a"
"2703","rebuttable presumption that the Covered Person did not engage in"
"2704","Disabling Conduct."
"2705","Compromise Payment"
"2706","      Section 2.	As to any matter disposed of (whether by a"

"2709","which the action, suit, or proceeding was brought, that such"

"2713","least a majority of the disinterested Trustees acting on the"
"2714","matter (provided that a majority of the disinterested Trustees"
"2715","then in office act on the matter) upon a determination, based"
"2716","upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full"
"2717","trial type inquiry) that such Covered Person did not engage in"
"2718","Disabling Conduct, or (b) there has been obtained an opinion in"
"2719","writing of independent legal counsel, based upon a review of"
"2720","readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial type inquiry)"
"2721","to the effect that such Covered Person did not engage in"
"2722","Disabling Conduct.  Any approval pursuant to this Section shall"
"2723","not prevent the recovery from any Covered Person of any amount"
"2724","paid to such Covered Person in accordance with this Section as"
"2725","indemnification if such Covered Person is subsequently"
"2726","adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction not to have"
"2727","engaged in Disabling Conduct."
"2728","Right Not Exclusive"
"2729","      Section 3.	The right of indemnification hereby provided shall"

"2743","be entitled by contract or otherwise under law, nor the power of"
"2744","the Trust to purchase and maintain liability insurance on behalf"
"2745","of any such person."
"2746","Shareholders"
"2747","      Section 4.	In case any Shareholder or former Shareholder shall"
"2748","be held to be personally liable solely by reason of his or her"
"2749","being or having been a Shareholder and not because of his or her"
"2750","acts or omissions or for some other reason, the Shareholder or"

"2951","PUTNAM GLOBAL EQUITY FUND"
"2952","MANAGEMENT CONTRACT"
"2953","      This Management Contract is dated as of February 27, 2014"
"2954","between PUTNAM GLOBAL EQUITY FUND, a Massachusetts business trust"
"2955","(the  Fund ), and PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC, a Delaware"
"2956","limited liability company (the  Manager )."
"2957","      In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained,"
"2958","it is agreed as follows:"
"2959","1. 	SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY MANAGER TO FUND."
"2960","      (a) 	The Manager, at its expense, will furnish continuously"
"2961","an investment program for the Fund or, in the case of a Fund that"
"2962","has divided its shares into two or more series under Section"
"2963","18(f)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the"
"2964","1940 Act ), each series of the Fund identified from time to time"
"2965","on Schedule A to this Contract (each reference in this Contract"
"2966","to  a Fund  or to  the Fund  is also deemed to be a reference to"
"2967","any existing series of the Fund, as appropriate in the particular"
"2968","context), will determine what investments will be purchased, held,"
"2969","sold or exchanged by the Fund and what portion, if any, of the"
"2970","assets of the Fund will be held uninvested and will, on behalf of"
"2971","the Fund, make changes in such investments. Subject always to the"
"2972","control of the Trustees of the Fund and except for the functions"
"2973","carried out by the officers and personnel referred to in Section"
"2974","1(d), the Manager will also manage, supervise and conduct the"
"2975","other affairs and business of the Fund and matters incidental"
"2976","thereto. In the performance of its duties, the Manager will"
"2977","comply with the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of"
"2978","Trust and By  Laws of the Fund and the stated investment"
"2979","objectives, policies and restrictions of the Fund, will use its"
"2980","best efforts to safeguard and promote the welfare of the Fund and"
"2981","to comply with other policies which the Trustees may from time to"
"2982","time determine and will exercise the same care and diligence"
"2983","expected of the Trustees."
"2984","      (b) 	The Manager, at its expense, except as such expense is"
"2985","paid by the Fund as provided in Section 1(d), will furnish (1)"
"2986","all necessary investment and management facilities, including"
"2987","salaries of personnel, required for it to execute its duties"
"2988","faithfully; (2) suitable office space for the Fund; and (3)"
"2989","administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical"
"2990","personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of"
"2991","the affairs of the Fund, including determination of the net asset"
"2992","value of the Fund, but excluding shareholder accounting services."
"2993","Except as otherwise provided in Section 1(d), the Manager will"
"2994","pay the compensation, if any, of the officers of the Fund."
"2995","      (c) 	The Manager, at its expense, will place all orders for"
"2996","the purchase and sale of portfolio investments for the Funds"
"2997","account with brokers or dealers selected by the Manager. In the"
"2998","selection of such brokers or dealers and the placing of such"
"2999","orders, the Manager will use its best efforts to obtain for the"
"3000","Fund the most favorable price and execution available, except to"
"3001","the extent it may be permitted to pay higher brokerage"
"3002","commissions for brokerage and research services as described"
"3003","below. In using its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the most"
"3004","favorable price and execution available, the Manager, bearing in"
"3005","mind the Funds best interests at all times, will consider all"
"3006","factors it deems relevant, including by way of illustration,"
"3007","price, the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for"
"3008","the security, the amount of the commission, the timing of the"
"3009","transaction taking into account market prices and trends, the"
"3010","reputation, experience and financial stability of the broker or"
"3011","dealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the broker"
"3012","or dealer in other transactions. Subject to such policies as the"
"3013","Trustees of the Fund may determine, the Manager will not be"
"3014","deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty"
"3015","created by this Contract or otherwise solely by reason of its"
"3016","having caused the Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides"
"3017","brokerage and research services to the Manager an amount of"
"3018","commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in"
"3019","excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would"
"3020","have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Manager"
"3021","determines in good faith that such amount of commission was"
"3022","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research"
"3023","services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in terms of"
"3024","either that particular transaction or the Managers overall"
"3025","responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to other clients of"
"3026","the Manager as to which the Manager exercises investment"
"3027","discretion. The Manager agrees that in connection with purchases"
"3028","or sales of portfolio investments for the Funds account, neither"
"3029","the Manager nor any officer, director, employee or agent of the"
"3030","Manager shall act as a principal or receive any commission other"
"3031","than as provided in Section 3."
"3032","      (d) 	The Fund will pay or reimburse the Manager for the"
"3033","compensation in whole or in part of such officers of the Fund and"
"3034","persons assisting them as may be determined from time to time by"
"3035","the Trustees of the Fund. The Fund will also pay or reimburse the"
"3036","Manager for all or part of the cost of suitable office space,"
"3037","utilities, support services and equipment attributable to such"
"3038","officers and persons as may be determined in each case by the"
"3039","Trustees of the Fund. The Fund will pay the fees, if any, of the"
"3040","Trustees of the Fund."
"3041","      (e) 	The Manager will not be obligated to pay any expenses"
"3042","of or for the Fund not expressly assumed by the Manager pursuant"
"3043","to this Section 1 other than as provided in Section 3."
"3044","      (f) 	Subject to the prior approval of a majority of the"
"3045","Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who are not"
"3046","interested persons  and, to the extent required by the 1940 Act"
"3047","and the rules and regulations under the 1940 Act, subject to any"
"3048","applicable guidance or interpretation of the Securities and"
"3049","Exchange Commission or its staff, by the shareholders of the Fund,"
"3050","the Manager may, from time to time, delegate to a sub  adviser or"
"3051","sub  administrator any of the Managers duties under this Contract,"
"3052","including the management of all or a portion of the assets being"
"3053","managed. In all instances, however, the Manager must oversee the"
"3054","provision of delegated services, the Manager must bear the"
"3055","separate costs of employing any sub  adviser or sub"
"3056","administrator, and no delegation will relieve the Manager of any"
"3057","of its obligations under this Contract."
"3058","2. 	OTHER AGREEMENTS, ETC."
"3059","      It is understood that any of the shareholders, Trustees,"
"3060","officers and employees of the Fund may be a shareholder, director,"
"3061","officer or employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the"
"3062","Manager, and in any person controlled by or under common control"
"3063","with the Manager, and that the Manager and any person controlled"
"3064","by or under common control with the Manager may have an interest"
"3065","in the Fund. It is also understood that the Manager and any"
"3066","person controlled by or under common control with the Manager may"
"3067","have advisory, management, service or other contracts with other"
"3068","organizations and persons and may have other interests and"
"3069","business."

"3083","each month within 15 days after the close of the month."
"3084","      The fees payable by the Fund to the Manager pursuant to this"

"3086","similar payments received by the Manager or any affiliated person"
"3087","of the Manager in connection with the purchase and sale of"
"3088","portfolio investments of the Fund, less any direct expenses"
"3089","approved by the Trustees incurred by the Manager or any"
"3090","affiliated person of the Manager in connection with obtaining"
"3091","such payments."
"3092","      In the event that expenses of the Fund for any fiscal year"
"3093","exceed the expense limitation on investment company expenses"
"3094","imposed by any statute or regulatory authority of any"

"3096","or sale, the compensation due the Manager for such fiscal year"
"3097","will be reduced by the amount of excess by a reduction or refund"
"3098","thereof. In the event that the expenses of the Fund exceed any"
"3099","expense limitation which the Manager may, by written notice to"
"3100","the Fund, voluntarily declare to be effective subject to such"
"3101","terms and conditions as the Manager may prescribe in such notice,"
"3102","the compensation due the Manager will be reduced, and if"
"3103","necessary, the Manager will assume expenses of the Fund, to the"
"3104","extent required by the terms and conditions of such expense"
"3105","limitation."
"3106","      If the Manager serves for less than the whole of a month,"

"3226"," Total Open  End Mutual Fund Average Net Assets  means the"
"3227","average of all of the determinations of the aggregate net assets"
"3228","of all open  end funds sponsored by Putnam Management (excluding"
"3229","the net assets of such funds investing in, or invested in by,"
"3230","other such funds, such as Putnam RetirementReady Funds and"

"3235","Schedule C"
"3236","The Funds Base Fee computed in accordance with Schedule B will be"
"3237","adjusted, on a monthly basis, upward or downward, as the case may"
"3238","be, by an amount computed by applying the Performance Adjustment"
"3239","Rate to the Average Net Assets of the Fund for the Performance"
"3240","Period and dividing the result by twelve."
"3241","Performance Period. The Performance Period is equal to the"
"3242","shorter of (i) the period from January 1, 2010 to the end of the"
"3243","month for which the fee adjustment is being computed or (ii) the"
"3244","thirty  six month period then ended."
"3245","Performance Adjustment Rate. The Performance Adjustment Rate is"
"3246","equal to the product of 0.03 multiplied by the difference,"
"3247","positive or negative, obtained by subtracting (i) the Investment"
"3248","Record of the Benchmark for the Performance Period from (ii) the"
"3249","Investment Performance of the Measuring Class for the Performance"
"3250","Period; provided that the Performance Adjustment Rate for the"
"3251","Fund may not exceed the Maximum Performance Adjustment Rate set"
"3252","forth on Schedule B or be less than the Minimum Performance"
"3253","Adjustment Rate set forth on Schedule B."
"3254","Investment Performance and Investment Record. These terms are"
"3255","used as defined in Rule 205  1 under the Investment Advisers Act"
"3256","of 1940, as amended, and shall each be computed on an annualized"
"3257","basis for any Performance Period greater than one year."
"3258","Benchmark. The Funds initial Benchmark is set forth in Schedule B."
"3259","If the Trustees determine that another appropriate index of"
"3260","securities prices should be substituted as the Benchmark, the"
"3261","Trustees may determine, with the consent of the Manager, to use"
"3262","such other appropriate index of securities prices for purposes of"
"3263","this Schedule C (the  Replacement Benchmark ) without shareholder"
"3264","approval, unless shareholder approval of the change is otherwise"
"3265","required by applicable law. Any Replacement Benchmark will be"
"3266","applied prospectively to determine the amount of the Performance"
"3267","Adjustment. The Benchmark will continue to be used to determine"
"3268","the amount of the Performance Adjustment for that part of the"
"3269","Performance Period prior to the effective date of the Replacement"
"3270","Benchmark."
"3271","Measuring Class. The  Measuring Class  of shares of the Fund"
"3272","initially is Class A shares of the Fund. If the Trustees"
"3273","determine that a different class of shares of the Fund is the"
"3274","most appropriate for use in calculating the Performance"
"3275","Adjustment, the Trustees may change, with the consent of the"
"3276","Manager, the class of shares used as the Measuring Class without"
"3277","shareholder approval, unless shareholder approval of such change"
"3278","is otherwise required by applicable law. If a different class of"
"3279","shares ( Replacement Measuring Class ) is substituted in"
"3280","calculating the Performance Adjustment, the use of that"
"3281","Replacement Measuring Class of shares for purposes of calculating"
"3282","the Performance Adjustment may apply to the entire Performance"
"3283","Period so long as the Replacement Measuring Class was outstanding"
"3284","at the beginning of such period. If the Replacement Measuring"
"3285","Class of shares was not outstanding for all or a portion of the"
"3286","Performance Period, it may only be used in calculating that"
"3287","portion of the Performance Adjustment attributable to the period"
"3288","during which the Replacement Measuring Class was outstanding and"
"3289","any previous portion of the Performance Period will be calculated"
"3290","using the Measuring Class."
"3291","Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Schedule C, the"
"3292","computation of the Performance Adjustment Rate, the Investment"
"3293","Performance of the Measuring Class and the Investment Record of"
"3294","the Benchmark will be made in accordance with the Investment"
"3295","Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and any applicable rules"
