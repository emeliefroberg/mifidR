"1288","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1289","To the Shareholders and"
"1290","Board of Trustees of"
"1291","MainStay Funds Trust:"
"1292","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"1293","MainStay Funds Trust, comprised of the MainStay Tax Advantaged"
"1294","Short Term Bond Fund and the MainStay Absolute Return Multi-"
"1295","Strategy Fund, (collectively, the Funds), as of  April 30, 2017, in"
"1296","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1297","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"1298","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1299","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1300","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1301","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"1302","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1303","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"1304","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1305","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"1306","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1307","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1308","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"1309","costs of controls. A company's internal control over financial"
"1310","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1311","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1312","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1313","generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal"
"1314","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1315","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1316","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1317","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1318","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1319","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1320","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures"
"1321","of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"1322","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)"
"1323","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"1324","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the"
"1325","company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"1326","statements."
"1327","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"1328","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections"
"1329","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1330","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"1331","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"1332","procedures may deteriorate."
"1333","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1334","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"1335","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1336","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"1337","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"1338","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1339","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds'"
"1340","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1341","detected on a timely basis."
"1342","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"1343","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1344","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1345","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"1346","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1347","(United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'"
"1348","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"1349","controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"1350","material weakness as defined above as of April 30, 2017."
"1351","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1352","management and the Board of Trustees of MainStay Funds Trust"
"1353","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to"
"1354","be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"1355","parties."

"1373","On December 23, 2014, Cynthia Ann Redus-Tarchis and"
"1374","others filed a complaint against New York Life Investments in"
"1375","the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey."
"1376","The complaint was brought derivatively on behalf of the"
"1377","MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund, the MainStay High Yield"
"1378","Corporate Bond Fund, and another fund previously managed"
"1379","by New York Life Investments and alleges that New York"
"1380","Life Investments violated Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act by"
"1381","charging excessive investment management fees. The"
"1382","plaintiffs seek monetary damages and other relief from New"
"1383","York Life Investments. New York Life Investments believes"
"1384","that the case has no merit, and intends to vigorously defend"
"1385","the matter."
"1386","On May 6, 2015, a second amended complaint was filed"
"1387","which, among other things, added MainStay High Yield"
"1388","Opportunities Fund as an additional Fund on whose behalf the"
"1389","complaint was brought. New York Life Investments filed a"
"1390","motion to dismiss the amended complaint. This motion was"
"1391","denied on October 28, 2015. New York Life Investments filed"
"1392","an answer to the amended complaint on November 30, 2015."
"1393","Fact discovery in the case has been completed and expert"
