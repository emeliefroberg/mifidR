"1176","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1177","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Equity Funds (Invesco Equity"
"1178","Funds):"
"1179","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of each of"
"1180","the following three funds:"
"1181","Invesco Charter Fund"
"1182","Invesco Diversified Dividend Fund"
"1183","Invesco Summit Fund"
"1184","(hereafter collectively referred to as the Funds), as of and for the year"
"1185","ended October 31, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"1186","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal"
"1187","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1188","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"1189","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1190","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"1191","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"1192","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"1193","internal control over financial reporting."
"1194","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1195","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1196","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1197","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"1198","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1199","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1200","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1201","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"1202","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1203","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1204","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"1205","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1206","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1207","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"1208","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"1209","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1210","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"1211","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1212","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1213","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1214","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"1215","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1216","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1217","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"1218","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"1219","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1220","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"1221","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"1222","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1223","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"1224","on a timely basis."
"1225","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"1226","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1227","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"1228","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1229","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"1230","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"1231","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"1232","be material weaknesses as defined above as of October 31, 2017."
"1233","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"1234","the Board of Trustees of AIM Equity Funds (Invesco Equity Funds) and the"
"1235","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be"
"1236","used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"2612","              known to the Trust or that Portfolio, but for which the identity"
"2613","              of the claimant is unknown, and claims and obligations that have"
"2614","              not been made known to the Trust or that Portfolio or that have"
"2615","              not arisen but that, based on the facts known to the Trust or"

"2624","    (c)  On termination of any Class pursuant to paragraph (a) above,"
"2625","         (1)  the Trust thereafter shall no longer issue Shares of that Class,"
"2626","         (2)  the Trustees shall do all other acts appropriate to terminate the"
"2627","              Class, and"
"2628","         (3)  the Trustees shall distribute ratably among the Shareholders of"

"2635","              assets of the Portfolio of which that Class is a part as they"
"2636","              deem necessary. Alternatively, in connection with the termination"
"2637","              of any Class, the Trustees may treat such termination as a"
"2638","              redemption of the Shareholders of such Class effected pursuant to"
"2639","              Section 7.3 of this Agreement provided that the costs relating to"
"2640","              the termination of such Class shall be included in the"
"2641","              determination of the net asset value of the Shares of such"
"2642","              Class for purposes of determining the redemption price to be paid"
"2643","              to the Shareholders of such Class (to the extent not otherwise"
"2644","              included in such determination)."

"2648","    (e)  On dissolution of the Trust, following completion of winding up of its"
"2649","         business, any one (1) Trustee shall execute, and cause to be filed, a"

"2655","         whereupon the Trust shall terminate and the Trustees and the Trust"
"2656","         shall be discharged from all further liabilities and duties hereunder"
"2657","         with respect thereto. The Trustees shall not be personally liable to"
"2658","         the claimants of the dissolved Trust by reason of the Trustees'"
"2659","         actions in winding up the Trust's affairs if the Trustees complied"
"2660","         with Section 3808(e) of the Delaware Act."
"2661","   Section 9.4 Sale of Assets; Merger and Consolidation. The Trustees may cause"
"2662","(i) the Trust or one or more of its Portfolios to the extent consistent with"

"2673","consolidation including the power to create one or more separate statutory"
"2674","trusts to which all or any part of the assets, liabilities, profits or losses"

"2699","   Section 9.6 Governing Law. The Trust and the Governing Instrument (including"
"2700","this Agreement) and the rights, obligations and remedies of the Trustees and"
"2701","Shareholders hereunder, are to be governed by and construed and administered"
"2702","according to the Delaware Act, including the provision that gives maximum"
"2703","freedom to contract, and the other laws of the State of Delaware and the"

"2725","the Trustees or officers of the Trust set forth or referenced in the Governing"
"2726","Instrument."
"2727","       The Trust shall be of the type commonly called a statutory trust, and"
"2728","without limiting the provisions hereof, the Trust may exercise all powers which"
"2729","are ordinarily exercised by such a trust under Delaware law. The Trust"
"2730","specifically reserves the right to exercise any of the powers or privileges"

"2732","Delaware Act, and the absence of a specific reference herein to any such power,"

"2736","   Section 9.7 Amendments. The Trustees may amend this Agreement by making an"
"2737","amendment to this Agreement or to Schedule A, an agreement supplemental hereto,"

"2739","Shareholder shall be required for any amendment to this Agreement except as"
"2740","specifically provided in Article VI hereof, as determined by the Trustees in"
"2741","their sole discretion, or as required by federal law including the 1940 Act,"
"2742","but only to the extent so required. Any such amendment, having been approved by"

"2748","amended, executed by a majority of the Trustees, or a duly authorized officer"
"2749","of the Trust, shall be conclusive evidence of such amendment when lodged among"
"2750","the records of the Trust. Any officer of the Trust is authorized from time to"
"2751","time to restate this Agreement into a single instrument to reflect all"
"2752","amendments hereto made in accordance with the terms hereof. The Certificate of"
"2753","Trust of the Trust may be restated and/or amended by any Trustee as necessary"

"2758","   Section 9.8 Provisions in Conflict with Law. The provisions of this"
"2759","Agreement are severable, and if the Trustees shall determine, with the advice"
"2760","of counsel, that any of such provisions is in conflict with applicable law, the"
"2761","conflicting provision shall be deemed never to have constituted a part of this"
"2762","Agreement; provided, however, that such determination shall not affect any of"
"2763","the remaining provisions of this Agreement or render invalid or improper any"
"2764","action taken or omitted prior to such determination. If any provision of this"

"2768","jurisdiction or any other provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction."
"2769","   Section 9.9 Inspection of Records. Every Trustee shall have the right at any"
"2770","reasonable time to inspect all books, records, and documents of every kind and"

"2778","Shareholder shall have the right to obtain from the Trust a list of the Trust's"
"2779","Shareholders. Except as required by the 1940 Act, Shareholders shall have no"
"2780","right to inspect the records, documents, accounts and books of the Trust. Any"
"2781","request to inspect the records of the Trust shall be submitted by the"
"2782","Shareholder to the Trust in writing. Upon receipt of any such request, the"
"2783","Trustees shall determine whether delivery of records pertaining to such request"
"2784","is required by the 1940 Act or is otherwise necessary or appropriate, as"
"2785","determined by the Trustees in their sole discretion, and whether such request"
"2786","complies with the requirements of the 1940 Act and, if so, establish procedures"
"2787","for such inspection. To preserve the integrity of the records, the Trust may"
"2788","provide certified copies of Trust records rather than originals. The Trust"
"2789","shall not be required to create records or obtain records from third parties to"
"2790","satisfy a Shareholder request. The Trust may require a requesting Shareholder"
"2791","to pay in advance or otherwise indemnify the Trust for the costs and expenses"
"2792","of such Shareholder's inspection of records. The rights provided for in this"
"2793","Section 9.9 shall not extend to any Person who is a Shareholder but not also a"
"2794","Record Owner."

"2796","agrees and acknowledges that the name Invesco is the sole property of Invesco"
"2797","Ltd. (Invesco). Invesco has granted to the Trust a non-exclusive license to"
"2798","use such name as part of the name of the Trust now and in the future. The Board"
"2799","of Trustees further expressly agrees and acknowledges that the non-exclusive"
"2800","license granted herein may be terminated by Invesco if the Trust ceases to use"
"2801","Invesco or one of its Affiliated Persons as investment adviser or to use other"
"2802","Affiliated Persons or successors of Invesco for such purposes. In such event,"
"2803","the non-exclusive license may be revoked by Invesco and the Trust shall cease"
"2804","using the name Invesco or any name misleadingly implying a continuing"
"2805","relationship between the Trust and Invesco or any of its Affiliated Persons, as"
"2806","part of its name unless otherwise consented to by Invesco or any successor to"
"2807","its interests in such name."
"2808","   The Board of Trustees further understands and agrees that so long as Invesco"
"2809","and/or any future advisory Affiliated Person of Invesco shall continue to serve"
"2810","as the Trust's investment adviser, other registered open- or closed-end"
"2811","investment companies (funds) and other types of investment vehicles as may be"
"2812","sponsored or advised by Invesco or its Affiliated Persons shall have the right"
"2813","permanently to adopt and to use the name Invesco in their names and in the"
"2814","names of any series or class of shares of such funds."
"2815","   Section 9.11 Derivative Actions. In addition to the requirements set forth"
"2816","in Section 3816 of the Delaware Act, a Shareholder may bring a derivative"
"2817","action on behalf of the Trust only if the following conditions are met:"
"2818","    (a)  The Shareholder or Shareholders must make a pre-suit demand upon the"
"2819","         Trustees to bring the subject action unless an effort to cause the"
"2820","         Trustees to bring such an action is not likely to succeed. For"
"2821","         purposes of this Section 9.11(a), a demand on the Trustees shall only"
"2822","         be deemed not likely to succeed and therefore excused if a majority of"
"2823","         the Board of Trustees is composed of Trustees who are not Independent"
"2824","         Trustees and the Board of Trustees has not established a committee to"
"2825","         consider the merits of such action or, if the Board of Trustees has"
"2826","         established such a committee, a majority of that committee is composed"

"2830","         under the Delaware Act who collectively hold Shares representing ten"
"2831","         percent (10%) or more of the"
"2832","                                      24"
"2833","<PAGE>"
"2834","         total combined net asset value of all Shares issued and outstanding,"
"2835","         or of the Portfolios or Classes to which such action relates if it"
"2836","         does not relate to all Portfolios and Classes, must join in the"
"2837","         pre-suit demand for the Trustees to commence such action; and"
"2838","    (c)  Unless a demand is not required under paragraph (a) of this"
"2839","         Section 9.11, the Trustees must be afforded a reasonable amount of"
"2840","         time to consider such Shareholder request and to investigate the basis"
"2841","         of such claim. The Trustees shall be entitled to retain counsel or"
"2842","         other advisors in considering the merits of the request and may"
"2843","         require an undertaking by the Shareholders making such request to"
"2844","         reimburse the Trust for the expense of any such advisors in the event"
"2845","         that the Trustees determine not to bring such action."
"2846","    (d)  For purposes of this Section 9.11, the Board of Trustees may designate"
"2847","         a committee of one or more Trustees to consider a Shareholder demand"
"2848","         if necessary to create a committee with a majority of Trustees who are"
"2849","         Independent Trustees. The Trustees on that committee shall be entitled"
"2850","         to retain counsel or other advisors in considering the merits of the"
"2851","         request and may require an undertaking by the Shareholders making such"
"2852","         request to reimburse the Trust for the expense of any such advisors in"
"2853","         the event that the Trustees on the committee determine not to bring"
"2854","         such action."
"2855","    (e)  In addition to all suits, claims or other actions (collectively,"
"2856","         claims) that under applicable law must be brought as derivative"
"2857","         claims, each Shareholder of the Trust or any Portfolio or"
"2858","         Class thereof agrees that any claim that affects all Shareholders of a"
"2859","         Portfolio or Class either equally or proportionately based on their"
"2860","         number of Shares in such Portfolio or Class, must be brought as a"
"2861","         derivative claim subject to this Section 9.11 irrespective of whether"
"2862","         such claim involves a violation of the Shareholders' rights under this"
"2863","         Agreement or any other alleged violation of contractual or individual"
"2864","         rights that might otherwise give rise to a direct claim."
"2865","   Section 9.12 Jurisdiction and Waiver of Jury Trial. In accordance with"
"2866","Section 3804(e) of the Delaware Act, any suit, action or proceeding brought by"

"2870","Class, or any Shares (including any claim of any nature against the Trust, any"
"2871","Portfolio or Class, the Trustees, or officers of the Trust) shall be brought"
"2872","exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware to the extent"
"2873","there is subject matter jurisdiction in such court for the claims asserted or,"
"2874","if not, then in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware. All Shareholders"
"2875","and other such Persons hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of such"

"2877","action or proceeding and irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by"
"2878","law, any objection they may make now or hereafter have to the laying of the"
"2879","venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in such court or that any such"
"2880","suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an"
