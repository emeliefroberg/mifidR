Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Trustees and Shareholders of JPMorgan Trust I

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of the JPMorgan Diversified Real
Return Fund, JPMorgan Floating Rate Income Fund, and JPMorgan Global Bond Opportunities Fund,
(the Funds) as of and for the year ended August 31, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal
control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for
designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial
statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over
financial reporting.

The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are
required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control
does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned
functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose
described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control
over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the
Funds' internal control over financial reporting and their operation, including controls over
safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of August
31, 2013.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of management, the Trustees of JPMorgan
Trust I and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be
used by anyone other than these specified parties.
