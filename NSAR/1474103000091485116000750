"3103","To the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Global Asset Management Trust and the"
"3104","Shareholders of QS Strategic Real Return Fund, QS International Equity Fund,"
"3105","QS Global Market Neutral Fund, Legg Mason BW Diversified Large Cap Value"

"3109","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of QS"
"3110","Strategic Real Return Fund, QS International Equity Fund, QS Global Market"
"3111","Neutral Fund, Legg Mason BW Diversified Large Cap Value Fund, Legg Mason BW"
"3112","Dynamic Large Cap Value Fund, Miller Income Opportunity Trust, Martin Currie"
"3113","Emerging Markets Fund, and RARE Global Infrastructure Value Fund (eight of"
"3114","the funds comprising Legg Mason Global Asset Management Trust, the
Company) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2016, in accordance"
"3115","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"3116","States), we considered the Company's internal control over financial"
"3117","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"3118","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"3119","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"3120","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"3121","of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"3122","do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal"
"3123","control over financial reporting."
"3124","The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and"
"3125","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"3126","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"3127","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"3128","company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"3129","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"3130","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"3131","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"3132","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"3133","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"3134","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"3135","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"3136","that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"3137","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"3138","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"3139","only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"3140","company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"3141","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"3142","company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"3143","statements."
"3144","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"3145","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any"
"3146","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"3147","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"3148","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3149","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"3150","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"3151","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"3152","detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"3153","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"3154","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"3155","material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial"
"3156","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3157","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over financial reporting"
"3158","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3159","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"3160","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by"
"3161","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we"
"3162","noted no deficiencies in the Company's internal control over financial"
"3163","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities"
"3164","that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of September"
"3165","30, 2016."
"3166","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"3167","the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Global Asset Management Trist and the"
"3168","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not"
"3169","be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"3274","Trustees (the Board), the Manager, the Adviser and the"
"3275","Subadviser, Western Japan shall regularly provide the Fund, with"

"3308","investment companies. Western Japan will place orders pursuant to"
"3309","its investment determinations for the Fund either directly with the"

"3330","discretion. The Board may adopt policies and procedures that"

"3469","the Adviser, the Subadviser, the Fund or the Fund's shareholders"
"3470","to which Western Japan would otherwise be subject by reason of"
"3471","willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the"

"3505","Manager, the Subadviser, Western Japan, and a predecessor in interest"
"3506","to the Adviser. This Agreement will become effective with respect"
"3507","to the Fund on the date set forth below the Fund's name on"

"3520","this Agreement, by vote cast in person at a meeting called for"
"3521","the purpose of voting on such approval. It is intended that each"
"3522","such annual approval of continuance of this Agreement occur by the"
"3523","anniversary of the Original Effective Date, except as may otherwise be"
"3524","pennitted in accordance with applicable law."
"3525","     13.	This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund"
"3526","without penalty by the Board or by vote of a majority of the"
"3527","outstanding voting securities of the Fund, in each case on not"
"3528","more than 60 days' nor less than 30 days' written notice to"

"3670","of April, 2016, by and among Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor,"
"3671","LLC (the Manager), a Delaware limited liability company, QS"

"3688","Schedule A annexed hereto (the Fund) and the Subadviser is"
"3689","willing to furnish such services on the terms and conditions"
"3690","hereinafter set forth;"
"3691","    NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual"
"3692","covenants herein contained, it is agreed as follows:"
"3693","     1.	In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement"
"3694","between the Trust and the Manager with respect to the Fund (the"
"3695","Management Agreement) and the Advisory Agreement between the"
"3696","Manager and the Adviser with respect to the Fund (the Advisory
Agreement), the Manager and the Adviser hereby appoint the"
"3697","Subadviser as investment subadviser for that  portion of the"
"3698","Fund's assets as shall be allocated to the Subadviser by the"
"3699","Manager and/or Adviser from time to time, if any (the Allocated
Assets), for the period and on the terms set forth in this"
"3700","Agreement. The Manager and/or the Adviser may, from time to time,"
"3701","allocate and reallocate the Fund's assets among the Subadviser,"
"3702","the Adviser and other subadvisers of the Fund's assets. In"
"3703","addition, the Manager and/or the Adviser may determine not to"
"3704","allocate any portion of the Fund's assets to the Subadviser for a"
"3705","period of time during the term of this Agreement. The"
"3706","Subadviser's responsibilities for providing investment advisory"
"3707","services to the Fund shall be limited to the Allocated Assets."
"3708","The Subadviser accepts such appointment and agrees to render the"
"3709","services herein set forth for the compensation herein provided."
"3710","    2.	The Manager and the Adviser shall cause the Subadviser to be"
"3711","kept fully informed at all times with regard to the securities"
"3712","owned by the Fund that are part of the Allocated Assets, the"
"3713","funds available, or to become available, for investment as part"
"3714","of the Allocated Assets, and generally as to the condition of the"
"3715","Fund's affairs. The Manager and the Adviser shall furnish the"
"3716","Subadviser with such documents and information with regard to the"
"3717","Fund's affairs as the Subadviser may from time to time reasonably"
"3718","request."
"3719","    3.	(a) Subject to the supervision of the Trust's Board of"
"3720","Trustees (the Board), the Manager and the Adviser, the"
"3721","Subadviser shall regularly provide the Fund, with respect to"
"3722","the Allocated Assets, with investment research, advice,"
"3723","management and supervision and shall furnish a continuous"
"3724","investment program for the Allocated Assets consistent with the"
"3725","Fund's"
"3726","083/ 200694781.2"
"3727","investment objectives, policies and restrictions, as stated in the"
"3728","Fund's current Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information."
"3729","The Subadviser shall, with respect to the Allocated Assets,"
"3730","determine from time to time what securities and other investments"
"3731","will be purchased, retained, sold or exchanged by the Fund and"
"3732","what portion of the Allocated Assets will be held in the various"
"3733","securities and other investments in which the Fund invests, and"
"3734","shall implement those decisions (including the execution of"
"3735","investment documentation), all subject to the provisions of the"
"3736","Trust's Declaration of Trust and By-Laws (collectively, the"
"3737","Governing Documents), the 1940 Act, and the applicable rules and"
"3738","regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange"
"3739","Commission (the SEC) and interpretive guidance issued thereunder"
"3740","by the SEC staff and any other applicable federal and state law,"
"3741","as well as the investment objectives, policies and restrictions of"
"3742","the Fund, and any other specific policies adopted by the Board"
"3743","and disclosed to the Subadviser. The Subadviser is authorized as"
"3744","the agent of the Trust to give instructions with respect to the"
"3745","Allocated Assets to the custodian of the Fund and any sub-"
"3746","custodian or prime broker as to deliveries of securities and other"
"3747","investments and payments of cash in respect of securities"
"3748","transactions or cash margin calls for the account of the Fund."
"3749","Subject to applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the rules and"
"3750","regulations promulgated thereunder, the investment"
"3751","program to be provided hereunder may entail the investment of all"
"3752","or substantially all of the assets of the Fund in one or more"
"3753","investment companies. The Subadviser will place orders pursuant to"
"3754","its investment determinations for the Fund either directly with"
"3755","the issuer or with any broker or dealer, foreign currency dealer,"
"3756","futures commission merchant or others selected by it. In"
"3757","connection with the selection of such brokers or dealers and the"
"3758","placing of such orders, subject to applicable law, brokers or"
"3759","dealers may be selected who also provide brokerage and research"
"3760","services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the"
"3761","Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act))"
"3762","to the Fund and/or the other accounts over which the Subadviser or"
"3763","its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The Subadviser is"
"3764","authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage"
"3765","and research services a commission for executing a portfolio"
"3766","transaction for the Fund which is in excess of the amount of"
"3767","commission another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"3768","effecting that transaction if the Subadviser determines in good"
"3769","faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to"
"3770","the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such"
"3771","broker or dealer. This determination may be viewed in terms of"
"3772","either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities"
"3773","which the Subadviser and its affiliates have with respect to"
"3774","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Board"
"3775","may adopt policies and procedures that modify and restrict the"
"3776","Subadviser's authority regarding the execution of the Fund's"
"3777","portfolio transactions provided herein. The Subadviser shall"
"3778","exercise voting rights, rights to consent to corporate action and"
"3779","any other rights pertaining to the Allocated Assets subject to"
"3780","such direction as the Board may provide, and shall perform such"
"3781","other functions of investment management and supervision as may be"
"3782","directed by the Board. The Subadviser may execute on behalf of the"
"3783","Fund certain agreements, instruments and documents in connection"
"3784","with the services performed by it under this Agreement. These may"
"3785","include, without limitation, brokerage agreements, clearing"
"3786","agreements, account documentation, futures and options agreements,"
"3787","swap agreements, other investment related agreements, and any"
"3788","other agreements, documents or instruments the Subadviser believes"
"3789","are appropriate or desirable in performing its duties under this"
"3790","Agreement."
"3791","    (b) The Fund hereby authorizes any entity or person"
"3792","associated with the Subadviser which is a member of a national"
"3793","securities exchange to effect any transaction on the exchange for"
"3794","the account of the Fund which is permitted by Section l l (a) of"
"3795","the Exchange Act and Rule 1la2-"
"3796","083/ 200694781.2"
"3797","2(T) thereunder, and the Fund hereby consents to the retention"
"3798","of compensation for such transactions in accordance with Rule"
"3799","l la2-2(T)(a)(2)(iv). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the"
"3800","Subadviser agrees that it will not deal with itself, or with"
"3801","members of the Board or any principal underwriter of the Fund,"
"3802","as principals or agents in making purchases or sales of"
"3803",":securities or other property for the account of the Fund, nor"
"3804","will it purchase any securities from an underwriting or selling"
"3805","group in which the Subadviser or its affiliates is participating,"
"3806","or arrange for purchases and sales of securities between the Fund"
"3807","and another account advised by the Subadviser or its affiliates,"
"3808","except in each case as permitted by the 1940 Act and the rules"
"3809","and regulations promulgated thereunder and in accordance with"
"3810","such policies and procedures as may be adopted by the Fund from"
"3811","time to time, and will comply with all other provisions of the"
"3812","Governing Documents and the Fund's then-current Prospectus and"
"3813","Statement of Additional Information relative to the Subadviser"
"3814","and its directors and officers."
"3815","    4.	The Subadviser may delegate to any other one or more"
"3816","companies that the Subadviser controls, is controlled by, or is"
"3817","under common control with, or to specified employees of any such"
"3818","companies, certain of the Subadviser's duties under this"
"3819","Agreement, provided in each case the Subadviser will supervise"
"3820","the activities of each such entity or employees thereof, that"
"3821","such delegation will not relieve the Subadviser of any of its"
"3822","duties or obligations under this Agreement and provided further"
"3823","that any such arrangements are entered into in accordance with"
"3824","and meet all applicable requirements of the 1940 Act and the"
"3825","rules and regulations promulgated thereunder."
"3826","    5.	The Subadviser agrees that it will keep records relating to"
"3827","its services hereunder in accordance with all applicable laws,"
"3828","and in compliance with the requirements of Rule 3 la-3 under the"
"3829","1940 Act, the Subadviser hereby agrees that any records that it"
"3830","maintains for the Fund are the property of the Fund, and further"
"3831","agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any of such records"
"3832","upon the Fund's request. The Subadviser further agrees to"
"3833","arrange for the preservation of the records required to be"
"3834","maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act for the periods"
"3835","prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act."

"4416","the Fund for satisfaction and that it shall have no claim"
"4417","against the assets of any other portfolios of the Trust or the"
"4418","Trustees of the Trust."
"4419","     15.	No provision of this Agreement may be changed, waived,"

"4421","writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the"

"4425","of a majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities."
"4426","     16.	This Agreement, and any supplemental terms contained on"
"4427","Annex I hereto, if applicable, embodies the entire agreement and"
"4428","understanding between the parties hereto, and supersedes all"

"4533","services on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;"
"4534","    NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual"

"4548","affairs. The Manager shall furnish the Adviser with such documents"
"4549","and information with regard to the Fund's affairs as the Adviser"
"4550","may from time to time reasonably request."
"4551","     3.	(a) Subject to the supervision of the Trust's Board of"
"4552","Trustees (the Board) and  the Manager, the Adviser shall"
"4553","regularly provide the Fund, with respect to such portion of the"

"4558","with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and restrictions,"
"4559","as stated in the Fund's current Prospectus and Statement of"
"4560","Additional Information. The Adviser shall, with respect to the"
"4561","Allocated Assets, determine from time to time what securities and"
"4562","other investments will be purchased, retained, sold or exchanged"

"4601","that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the"
"4602","value of the brokerage and research services"
"4603","provided by such broker or dealer. This determination may be"
"4604","viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the"
"4605","overall responsibilities which the Adviser and its affiliates"
"4606","have with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment"

"4616","documents in connection"
"4617","with the services performed by it under this Agreement. These may"
"4618","include, without limitation, brokerage agreements, clearing"
"4619","agreements, account documentation, futures and options"

"4621","and any other agreements, documents or instruments the Adviser"
"4622","believes are appropriate or desirable in performing its duties"
"4623","under this Agreement."

"5468","authorized to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage"
"5469","and research services a commission for executing a portfolio"
"5470","transaction for the Fund which is in excess of the amount of"
"5471","commission another broker or dealer would have charged for"
"5472","effecting that transaction if the Subadviser determines in good"
"5473","faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to"
"5474","the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such"
"5475","broker or dealer. This determination may be viewed in terms of"
"5476","either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities"
"5477","which the Subadviser and its affiliates have with respect to"
"5478","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Board"
"5479","may adopt policies and procedures that modify and restrict the"
"5480","Subadviser's authority regarding the execution of the Fund's"
"5481","portfolio transactions provided herein. The Subadviser shall"
"5482","exercise voting rights, rights to consent to corporate action and"
"5483","any other rights pertaining to the Allocated Assets subject to"
"5484","such direction as the Board may provide, and shall perform such"
"5485","other functions of investment management and supervision as may be"
"5486","directed by the Board. The Subadviser may execute on behalf of the"
"5487","Fund certain agreements, instruments and documents in connection"
"5488","with the services performed by it under this Agreement. These may"
"5489","include, without limitation, brokerage agreements, clearing"
"5490","agreements, account documentation, futures and options agreements,"
"5491","swap agreements, other investment related agreements, and any"
"5492","other agreements, documents or instruments the Subadviser believes"
"5493","are appropriate or desirable in performing its duties under this"
"5494","Agreement."
"5495","    (b) Subject to the supervision of the Board, the Manager and"
"5496","the Adviser and the provisions of Paragraph 3(a) above, the"
"5497","Subadviser shall assess the Fund's investment focus and make and"
"5498","implement decisions with respect to the allocation and"
"5499","reallocation of the Fund's assets among"
"5500","one or more investment subadvisers from time to time, as the"
"5501","Subadviser deems appropriate, in an effort to enable the Fund to"
"5502","achieve its investment goals. In addition, the Subadviser will"
"5503","monitor compliance of each such investment subadviser with the"
"5504","investment objectives, policies and restrictions of the Fund (or"
"5505","portion of the Fund) under the management of such investment"
"5506","subadviser, and review and report to the Board on the performance"
"5507","of each investment subadviser. The Subadviser shall also perform"
"5508","such other functions of management and supervision as may be"
"5509","requested by the Manager and Adviser and agreed to by the"
"5510","Subadviser."
"5511","     (c) The Fund hereby authorizes any entity or person"
"5512","associated with the Subadviser which is a member of a national"
"5513","securities exchange to effect any transaction on the exchange"
"5514","for the account of the Fund which is permitted by Section 1l(a)"
"5515","of the Exchange Act and Rule 1la2- 2(T) thereunde, and the Fund"
"5516","hereby consents to the retention of compensation for such"
"5517","transactions in accordance with Rule 1la2-2(T)(a)(2)(iv)."
"5518","Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Subadviser agrees that it"
"5519","will not deal with itself, or with members of the Board or any"
"5520","principal underwriter of the Fund, as principals or agents in"
"5521","making purchases or sales of securities or other property for"
"5522","the account of the Fund, nor will it purchase any securities"
"5523","from an underwriting or selling group in which the Subadviser or"
"5524","its affiliates is participating, or arrange for purchases and"
"5525","sales of securities between the Fund and another account advised"
"5526","by the Subadviser or its affiliates, except in each case as"
"5527","permitted by the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations"
"5528","promulgated thereunder and in accordance with such policies and"
"5529","procedures as may be adopted by the Fund from time to time, and"
"5530","will comply with all other provisions of the Governing Documents"
"5531","and the Fund's then-current Prospectus and Statement of"
"5532","Additional Information relative to the Subadviser and its"
"5533","directors and officers."
"5534","   4.	With respect to any or all of the Allocated Assets, the"
"5535","Subadviser, with the consent of the Manager and the Adviser, may"
"5536","enter into a contract (Foreign Subadvisory Agreement) with one"
"5537","or more investment subadvisers, including without limitation,"
"5538","affiliates of the Subadviser, in which the Subadviser delegates to"
"5539","such investment subadviser(s) all of its duties specified in"
"5540","Paragraph 3(a) hereunder, on such terms as the Subadviser will"
"5541","determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, provided that"
"5542","in each case the Subadviser shall supervise the activities of each"
"5543","such subadviser, that such delegation will not relieve the"
"5544","Subadviser of any of its duties or obligations under this"
"5545","Agreement with respect to the Allocated Assets or otherwise, and"
"5546","further provided that such subadviser is subject to all the"
"5547","conditions to which the Subadviser is subject hereunder in"
"5548","connection with the delegated duties and that such contracts"
"5549","impose on such investment subadviser(s) all the conditions to"
"5550","which the Subadviser is subject hereunder in connection with the"
"5551","delegated duties and that such contracts are entered into in"
"5552","accordance with and meet all applicable requirements of the 1940"
"5553","Act and the rules and regulations promulgated"
"5554","thereunder. Subject to any duties it may have under applicable"
"5555","law, the Subadviser does not intend at any time to provide day-to-"
"5556","day portfolio management services with respect to any assets of"
"5557","the Fund that have been allocated to an investment subadviser"
"5558","pursuant to this Paragraph 4 and Paragraph 3(b). In addition, the"
"5559","Subadviser may delegate to any other one or more companies that"
"5560","the Subadviser controls, is controlled by, or is under common"
"5561","control with, or to specified employees of any such companies,"
"5562","certain of the Subadviser's duties under this Agreement, provided"
"5563","in each case the Subadviser will supervise the activities of each"
"5564","such entity or employees thereof, that such delegation will not"
"5565","relieve the Subadviser of any of its duties or obligations  under"
"5566","this Agreement and provided further that any such arrangements are"
"5567","entered"
"5568","DBJ/ 200694787.2"
"5569","- 3"
"5570","into in accordance with and meet all applicable requirements of"
"5571","the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated"
"5572","thereunder."
"5573","     5.	The Subadviser agrees that it will keep records relating to"
"5574","its services hereunder in accordance with all applicable laws,"
"5575","and in compliance with the requirements of Rule 3 la-3 under the"
"5576","1940 Act, the Subadviser hereby agrees that any records that it"
"5577","maintains for the Fund are the property of the Fund, and further"
"5578","agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any of such records upon"
"5579","the Fund's request. The Subadviser further agrees to arrange for"
"5580","the preservation of the records required to be maintained by Rule"
"5581","31a-1 under the 1940 Act for the periods prescribed by Rule 3 la-"
"5582","2 under the 1940 Act."
"5583","    6.	(a) The Subadviser, at its expense, shall supply the"
"5584","Board, the officers of the Trust, the Manager and the Adviser"
"5585","with all information and reports reasonably required by them"
"5586","and reasonably available to the Subadviser relating to the"
"5587","services provided by the Subadviser"
"5588","*hereunder."
"5589","    (b) The Subadviser shall bear all expenses, and shall furnish"
"5590","all necessary services, facilities and personnel, in connection"
"5591","with its responsibilities under this Agreement. Other than as"
"5592","herein specifically indicated, the Subadviser shall not be"
"5593","responsible for the Fund's expenses, including, without"
"5594","limitation, advisory fees; distribution fees; interest; taxes;"
"5595","governmental fees; voluntary assessments and other expenses"
"5596","incurred in connection with membership in investment company"
"5597","organizations; organization costs of the Fund; the cost"
"5598","(including brokerage commissions, transaction fees or charges, if"
"5599","any) in connection with the purchase or sale of the Fund's"

"5601","therewith; fees and expenses of custodians, transfer agents,"
"5602","registrars, independent pricing vendors or other agents; legal"
"5603","expenses; loan commitment fees; expenses relating to share"

"5620","arise, including, without limitation, those relating to actions,"
"5621","suits or proceedings to which the Fund is  a party and the legal"
"5622","obligation which the Fund may have to indemnify the Fund's Board"
"5623","members and officers with respect thereto."
"5624","    7.	No member of the Board, officer or employee of the Trust or"
"5625","the Fund shall receive from the Trust or the Fund any salary or"
"5626","other compensation as such member of the Board, officer or"
"5627","employee while he is at the same time a director, officer, or"
"5628","employee of the Subadviser or any affiliated company of the"
"5629","Subadviser, except as the Board may decide. This paragraph shall"
"5630","not apply to Board members, executive committee members,"
"5631","consultants and other persons who are not regular members of the"
"5632","Subadviser's or any affiliated company's staff."
"5633","    8.	As compensation for the services performed by the"
"5634","Subadviser, including the services of any consultants retained by"
"5635","the Subadviser, the Manager shall pay the Subadviser as promptly"
"5636","as possible after the last day of each month, a fee, computed"
"5637","daily at an annual rate set forth on Schedule A annexed hereto."
"5638","The first payment of the fee shall be made as promptly as"
"5639","possible at the end of the month succeeding the effective date of"
"5640","this Agreement, and shall constitute a full payment of the fee"
"5641","due the Subadviser for all services prior to that date. Ifthis"
"5642","Agreement is terminated as of any date not the last day of a"
"5643","month, such fee shall be paid as promptly as possible after such"
"5644","date of termination, shall be based on the portion of the average"
"5645","daily net assets of the Fund comprising the Allocated Assets in"
"5646","that period from the beginning of such month to such date of"
"5647","termination, and shall be prorated according to the ratio that"
"5648","the number of business days in such period bears to the number of"
"5649","business days in such month. The average daily net assets of the"
"5650","Fund or the portion thereof comprising the Allocated Assets shall"
"5651","in all cases be based only on business days and be computed as of"
"5652","the time of the regular close of business of the New York Stock"
"5653","Exchange, or such other time as may be determined by the Board."
"5654","    9.	The Subadviser assumes no responsibility under this"
"5655","Agreement other than to render the services called for hereunder,"
"5656","in good faith, and shall not be liable for any error of judgment"
"5657","or mistake of law, or for any loss arising out of any investment"
"5658","or for any act or omission in the execution of securities"
"5659","transactions for the Fund, provided that nothing in this"
"5660","Agreement shall protect the Subadviser against any liability to"
"5661","the Manager, the Adviser, the Fund or the Fund's shareholders to"
"5662","which the Subadviser would otherwise be subject by reason of"
"5663","willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the"
"5664","performance of its duties or by reason of its reckless disregard"
"5665","of its obligations and duties hereunder. As used in this Section"
"5666","9, the term Subadviser shall include any affiliates of the"
"5667","Subadviser performing services for the Trust or the Fund"
"5668","contemplated hereby and the partners, shareholders, directors,"
"5669","officers and employees of the Subadviser and such affiliates."
"5670","     10.Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the"
"5671","right of any director, officer, or employee of the Subadviser who"
"5672","may also be a Board member, officer, or employee of the Trust or"
"5673","the Fund, to engage in any other business or to devote his time"
"5674","and attention in part to the management or other aspects of any"
"5675","other business, whether of a similar nature or a dissimilar"
"5676","nature, nor to limit or restrict the right of the Subadviser to"
"5677","engage in any other business or to render services of any kind,"
"5678","including investment advisory and management services, to any"
"5679","other fund, firm, individual or association. Ifthe purchase or"
"5680","sale of securities consistent with the investment policies of the"
"5681","Fund or one or more other accounts of the Subadviser is"
"5682","considered at or about the same time, transactions in such"
"5683","securities will be allocated among the accounts in a manner"
"5684","deemed equitable by the Subadviser. Such transactions may be"
"5685","combined, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and"
"5686","consistent with the Subadviser's policies and  procedures as"
"5687","presented to the Board from time to time."
"5688","     11.For the purposes of this Agreement, the Fund's net
assets shall be determined as provided in the Fund's then-"
"5689","current Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information and"
"5690","the terms assignment, interested person, and majority of the
outstanding voting securities shall have the meanings given to"
"5691","them by Section 2(a) of the 1940 Act, subject to such"
"5692","modifications or exemptions as may be granted by the SEC by any"
"5693","rule, regulation or order."
"5694","     12.This Agreement replaces an agreement, originally effective"
"5695","as of February 26, 2010 (the Original Effective Date), between the"
"5696","Manager, the Subadviser, and a predecessor in interest to the"
"5697","Adviser. This Agreement will become effective with respect to the"
"5698","Fund on the date set forth below the Fund's name on Schedule A"
"5699","annexed hereto, provided that it shall have been approved by the"
"5700","Board, including the separate vote of a majority of the Board"
"5701","members who are not interested persons of any party to this"
"5702","Agreement, and, if so required by the 1940 Act, by the"
"5703","shareholders of the Fund in accordance with the requirements of"
"5704","the 1940 Act. Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, this"
"5705","Agreement shall continue in effect with respect to the Fund, so"
"5706","long as such continuance is specifically approved at least"
"5707","annually (i) by the Board or (ii) by a vote of a majority of the"
"5708","outstanding voting securities of the Fund, provided that in either"
"5709","event the continuance is also approved by a majority of the Board"
"5710","members who are not interested persons of any party to this"
"5711","Agreement, by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the"
"5712","purpose of voting on such approval. It is intended that each such"
"5713","annual approval of continuance of this Agreement occur by the"
"5714","anniversary of the Original Effective Date, except as may otherwise be"
"5715","permitted in accordance with applicable law."
"5716","13.This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund"
"5717","without penalty by the"
"5718","Board or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities"
"5719","of the Fund, in each case on not more than 60 days' nor less than"
"5720","30 days' written notice to the Subadviser, or by the Subadviser"
"5721","upon not less than 90 days' written notice to the Fund, the Manager"
"5722","and the Adviser, and will be terminated upon the mutual written"
"5723","consent of the Manager, the Adviser and the Subadviser. This"
"5724","Agreement shall terminate automatically in the event of its"
"5725","assignment by the Subadviser and"
"5726","shall not be assignable by the Manager or the Adviser without the"
"5727","consent of the Subadviser."
"5728","     14.The Subadviser agrees that for any claim by it against"
"5729","the Fund in connection with this Agreement or the services"
"5730","rendered under this Agreement, it shall look only to assets of"
"5731","the Fund for satisfaction and that it shall have no claim against"
"5732","the assets of any other portfolios of the Trust."
"5733","     15.No provision of this Agreement may be changed, waived,"
"5734","discharged or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in"
"5735","writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the"
"5736","change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought, and no"
"5737","material amendment of the Agreement shall be effective until"
"5738","approved, if so required by the 1940 Act, by vote of the holders"
"5739","of a majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities."
"5740","     16.This Agreement, and any supplemental terms contained on"
"5741","Annex I hereto, if applicable, embodies the entire agreement and"
"5742","understanding between the parties hereto, and supersedes all prior"
"5743","agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter"
"5744","hereof. Should any part of this Agreement be held or made invalid"
"5745","by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise, the remainder of"
"5746","this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. This Agreement"
"5747","shall be binding on and shall inure to the benefit of the parties"
"5748","hereto and their respective successors."
