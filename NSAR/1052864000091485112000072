"875","Accounting Firm"
"876","To the Board of Directors of Legg Mason"
"877","Charles Street Trust, Inc. and to the"
"878","Shareholders of Legg Mason Batterymarch"
"879","U.S. Small Capitalization Equity Portfolio and"
"880","Legg Mason BW Global Opportunities Bond"
"881","Fund:"
"882","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"883","financial statements of Legg Mason"
"884","Batterymarch U.S. Small Capitalization"
"885","Equity Portfolio and Legg Mason BW Global"
"886","Opportunities Bond Fund (two of the"
"887","portfolios comprising Legg Mason Charles"
"888","Street Trust, Inc., the Company) as of and"
"889","for the year ended December 31, 2011, in"
"890","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"891","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"892","(United States), we considered the"
"893","Company?s internal control over financial"
"894","reporting, including controls over"
"895","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"896","designing our auditing procedures for the"
"897","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"898","financial statements and to comply with the"
"899","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"900","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"901","effectiveness of the Company?s internal"
"902","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"903","we do not express an opinion on the"
"904","effectiveness of the Company's internal"
"905","control over financial reporting."
"906","The management of the Company is"
"907","responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"908","effective internal control over financial"
"909","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"910","estimates and judgments by management"
"911","are required to assess the expected benefits"
"912","and related costs of controls.  A company?s"
"913","internal control over financial reporting is a"
"914","process designed to provide reasonable"
"915","assurance regarding the reliability of"
"916","financial reporting and the preparation of"
"917","financial statements for external purposes in"
"918","accordance with generally accepted"
"919","accounting principles.  A company's internal"
"920","control over financial reporting includes"
"921","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"922","to the maintenance of records that, in"
"923","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"924","reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"925","the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"926","reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"927","recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"928","of financial statements in accordance with"
"929","generally accepted accounting principles,"
"930","and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"931","company are being made only in accordance"
"932","with authorizations of management and"
"933","directors of the company; and (3)  provide"
"934","reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"935","or timely detection of unauthorized"
"936","acquisition, use or disposition of a company?s"
"937","assets that could have a material effect on"
"938","the financial statements."
"939","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"940","control over financial reporting may not"
"941","prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,"
"942","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness"
"943","to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"944","controls may become inadequate because of"
"945","changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"946","compliance with the policies or procedures"
"947","may deteriorate."
"948","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"949","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"950","of a control does not allow management or"
"951","employees, in the normal course of"
"952","performing their assigned functions, to"
"953","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"954","basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"955","a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"956","control over financial reporting, such that"
"957","there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"958","material misstatement of the Company's"
"959","annual or interim financial statements will"
"960","not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"961","basis."
"962","Our consideration of the Company?s internal"
"963","control over financial reporting was for the"
"964","limited purpose described in the first"
"965","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"966","all deficiencies in internal control over"
"967","financial reporting that might be material"
"968","weaknesses under standards established by"
"969","the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"970","Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"971","no deficiencies in the Company?s internal"
"972","control over financial reporting and its"
"973","operation, including controls over"
"974","safeguarding securities that we consider to"
"975","be material weaknesses as defined above as"
"976","of December 31, 2011."
