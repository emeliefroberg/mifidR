"945","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"946","To the Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust VIII and Shareholders of MFS Global"
"947","Growth Fund: In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"948","MFS Global Growth Fund (the  Fund) (a portfolio comprising  MFS Series Trust"
"949","VIII) as of and for the year ended  October 31,  2010,  in  accordance  with the"
"950","standards of the Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board (United States),  we"
"951","considered  the Fund's  internal  control over  financial  reporting,  including"
"952","controls  over  safeguarding  securities,  as a basis for designing our auditing"
"953","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial  statement"
"954","and to comply with the  requirements of Form N-SAR,  but not for the purpose of"
"955","expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"956","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. The management of"
"957","the Fund is responsible for  establishing  and maintaining  effective  internal"
"958","control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,  estimates"
"959","and  judgments by  management are required to assess the expected  benefits and"
"960","related costs of controls.A fund's internal control over financial reporting is"
"961","a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"962","financial  reporting and the  preparation of financial  statements for external"
"963","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"964","A fund's internal control over financial reporting  includes those policies and"
"965","procedures  that (1) pertain to the maintenance  of records that, in reasonable"
"966","detail,  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"967","assets of the fund;  (2) provide  reasonable assurance  that  transactions  are"
"968","recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in"
"969","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"970","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with  authorizations"
"971","of management and trustees of the trust;  and (3) provide reasonable  assurance"
"972","regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,  use, or"
"973","disposition  of a  fund's  assets  that  could  have a  material  effect on the"
"974","financial statements."
"975","Because of its inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"976","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"977","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"978","inadequate  because of changes in  conditions or that the degree of  compliance"
"979","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"980","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"981","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"982","course  of  performing   their  assigned   functions,   to  prevent  or  detect"
"983","misstatements  on a timely  basis.  A material  weakness is a  deficiency, or a"
"984","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"985","that  there is a  reasonable possibility  that a material  misstatement  of the"
"986","fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"987","on a timely basis."
"988","Our  consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial  reporting was"
"989","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in the first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"990","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"991","weaknesses  under  standards  established  by  the  Public  Company  Accounting"
"992","Oversight Board (United States).However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"993","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"994","for  safeguarding  securities,  that we consider to be a material  weakness, as"
"995","defined above, as of October 31, 2010."
"996","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
