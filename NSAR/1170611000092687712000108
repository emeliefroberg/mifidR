"665","<TEXT>"
"666","		REPORT OF INDEPENDENT"
"667","REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"668","To the Shareholders and Board of"
"669","Trustees of Bragg Capital Trust"
"670","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"671","statements of Bragg Capital Trust  the  Trust    comprising"
"672","Queens Road Value Fund and Queens Road Small Cap Value"
"673","Fund  the  Funds    as of and for the year ended May 31  2012"
"674","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"675","Accounting Oversight Board  United States   we considered the"
"676","Funds  internal control over financial reporting  including"
"677","controls over safeguarding securities  as a basis for designing"
"678","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"679","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"680","requirements of Form N-SAR  but not for the purpose of"
"681","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
"682","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly  we"
"683","express no such opinion."
"684","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"685","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"686","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility  estimates and"
"687","judgments by management are required to assess the"
"688","expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund s"
"689","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed"
"690","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"691","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"692","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"693","accepted accounting principles  GAAP .  A fund s internal"
"694","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"695","procedures that  1  pertain to the maintenance of records that"
"696","in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the"
"697","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund   2"
"698","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"699","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"700","accordance with GAAP  and that receipts and expenditures of"
"701","the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"702","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund  and"
"703","3  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"704","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use or"
"705","disposition of a fund s assets that could have a material effect"
"706","on the financial statements."
"707","Because of its inherent limitations  internal control over"
"708","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"709","Also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"710","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"711","inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the"
"712","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"713","deteriorate."
"714","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"715","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"716","management or employees  in the normal course of"
"717","performing their assigned functions  to prevent or detect"
"718","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"719","deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in internal"
"720","control over financial reporting  such that there is a reasonable"
"721","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds  annual"
"722","or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"723","detected on a timely basis."
"724","Our consideration of the Funds  internal control over financial"
"725","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"726","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"727","in internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"728","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"729","Oversight Board  United States .  However  we noted no"
"730","deficiencies in the Funds  internal control over financial"
"731","reporting and its operation  including controls over"
"732","safeguarding securities  that we consider to be a material"
