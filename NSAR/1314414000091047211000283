"531","<TEXT>"
"532","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"533","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"534","To the Board of Trustees of Northern Lights"
"535","Fund Trust and the Shareholders of"
"536","Investment Partners Opportunities Fund"
"537","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"538","financial statements of Investment Partners"
"539","Opportunities Fund the Fund a series of"
"540","shares of beneficial interest of the"
"541","Northern Lights Fund Trust as of December"
"542","31 2010 and for the period then ended, in"
"543","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"544","Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"545","United States PCAOB we considered its"
"546","internal control over financial reporting"
"547","including control activities for safeguarding"
"548","securities as a basis for designing our"
"549","auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"550","expressing our opinion on the financial"
"551","statements and to comply with the requirements"
"552","of Form NSAR, but not for the purpose of"
"553","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of"
"554","the Funds internal control over financial"
"555","reporting.  Accordingly we express no such"
"556","opinion."
"557","The management of Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"558","is responsible for establishing and"
"559","maintaining effective internal control over"
"560","financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"561","responsibility estimates and judgments by"
"562","management are required to assess the expected"
"563","benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"564","companys internal control over financial"
"565","reporting is a process designed to provide"
"566","reasonable assurance regarding the"
"567","reliability of financial reporting and the"
"568","preparation of financial statements for"
"569","external purposes in accordance with accounting"
"570","principles generally accepted in the United"
"571","States of America GAAP.  A companys"
"572","internal control over financial reporting"
"573","includes those policies and procedures that"
"574","1 pertain to the maintenance of records that"
"575","in reasonable detail accurately and fairly"
"576","reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"577","the assets of the company 2 provide"
"578","reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"579","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"580","the financial statements in accordance with GAAP"
"581","and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"582","company are being made only in accordance with"
"583","authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"584","company and 3 provide reasonable assurance"
"585","regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"586","unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of"
"587","a companys assets that could have a material"
"588","effect on the financial statements."
"589","Because of inherent limitations internal control"
"590","over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"591","detect misstatements.  Also projections of any"
"592","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"593","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"594","inadequate because of changes in conditions or"
"595","that the degree of compliance with the policies"
"596","or procedures may deteriorate."
"597","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"598","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"599","a control does not allow management or employees"
"600","in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"601","functions to prevent or detect misstatements on"
"602","a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"603","deficiency or combination of deficiencies in"
"604","internal control over financial reporting such"
"605","that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"606","material misstatement of the Funds annual or"
"607","interim financial statements will not be"
"608","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"609","Our consideration of the Funds internal control"
"610","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"611","purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"612","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"613","internal control that might be material weaknesses"
"614","under standards established by the PCAOB.  However"
"615","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal"
"616","control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"617","including controls for safeguarding securities that"
"618","we consider to be a material weakness as defined"
"619","above as of December 31 2010."
"620","This report is intended solely for the information"
"621","and use of management the shareholders of"
"622","Investment Partners Opportunities Fund, the Board"
"623","of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund Trust and the"
"624","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"625","intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"626","other than these specified parties."
