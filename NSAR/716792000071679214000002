"3471","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"3472","Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"3473","First Investors Tax Exempt Funds"
"3474","110 Wall Street"
"3475","New York, New York 10005"
"3476","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of First"
"3477","Investors Tax Exempt Funds (comprising, respectively, the Tax Exempt Income"
"3478","Fund, Tax Exempt Opportunities Fund, California Fund, Connecticut Fund,"
"3479","Massachusetts Fund, Michigan Fund, Minnesota Fund, New Jersey Fund, New York"
"3480","Fund, North Carolina Fund, Ohio Fund, Oregon Fund, Pennsylvania Fund"
"3481","and Virginia Fund) (the Funds) for the year ended December 31, 2013, in"
"3482","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"3483","Board (United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over"
"3484","financial reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"3485","securities, as a basis for designing our audit procedures for the purpose"
"3486","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"3487","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"3488","on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3489","reporting.   Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3490","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3491","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"3492","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"3493","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"3494","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"3495","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"3496","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"3497","with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal"
"3498","control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"3499","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"3500","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"3501","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"3502","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3503","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"3504","and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with"
"3505","authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"3506","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"3507","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"3508","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3509","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3510","may not prevent or detect misstatements.   Also, projections of any"
"3511","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"3512","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"3513","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3514","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"3515","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in"
"3516","the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"3517","detect misstatements on a timely basis.   A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"3518","or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"3519","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"3520","the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"3521","or detected on a timely basis."
"3522","Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"3523","First Investors Tax Exempt Funds"
"3524","Page Two"
"3525","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"3526","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3527","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"3528","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"3529","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).   However, we noted no"
"3530","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"3531","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"3532","to be material weaknesses, as defined above, as of December 31, 2013."

"3534","Shareholders and Board of Trustees of the First Investors Tax Exempt Funds"

"3996","	All proxies shall be delivered to the Secretary or other person"
"3997","	responsible for recording the proceedings before being voted.  A valid"
"3998","	proxy which does not state that it is irrevocable shall continue in full"
"3999","	force and effect unless (i) revoked by the person executing it before"
"4000","	the vote pursuant to that proxy is taken (a) by a writing delivered to"
"4001","	the Trust stating that the proxy is revoked, or (b) by a subsequent proxy"
"4002","	executed by such person, or (c) attendance at the meeting and voting in"
"4003","	person by the Person executing that proxy, or (d) revocation by such"
"4004","	person using any electronic, telephonic, computerized or other"
"4005","	alternative means authorized by the Trustees for authorizing the proxy"
"4006","	to act; or (ii) written notice of the death or incapacity of the maker"
"4007","	of that proxy is received by the Trust before the vote pursuant to that"
"4008","	proxy is counted.  A proxy with respect to Shares held in the name of"
"4009","	two or more persons shall be valid if executed by one of them unless at"
"4010","	or prior to exercise of such proxy the Trust receives a specific"
"4011","	written notice to the contrary from any one of them.  Unless otherwise"
"4012","	specifically limited by their terms, proxies shall entitle the"
"4013","	Shareholder to vote at any adjournment of a Shareholders' meeting.  A"
"4014","	proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall"
"4015","	be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the"
"4016","	burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger.  Subject to"
"4017","	the provisions of the Delaware Code entitled Treatment of Delaware
	Statutory Trusts, the Trust Instrument, or these By-laws, the General"
"4018","	Corporation Law of the State of Delaware relating to proxies, and"
"4019","	judicial interpretations thereunder shall govern all matters concerning"

"4048","	the determination of the Shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote"
"4049","	at, any such meeting.  The Shareholders of record entitled to vote at a"
"4050","	Shareholders' meeting shall be deemed the Shareholders of record at any"
"4051","	meeting reconvened after one or more adjournments, unless the Trustees"
"4052","	have fixed a new record date."
"4053","      Section 9. Action Without a Meeting."

"4080","	issued in accordance with Section 1 of this Article VI, upon surrender"
"4081","	to the Trust or the transfer agent of the Trust of such certificate for"
"4082","	shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession,"
"4083","	assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the Trust"
"4084","	to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the"
"4085","	old certificate and record the transaction upon its books."
"4086","Article VII"
"4087","INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND REPORTS"
"4088","      Every Trustee shall have the absolute right at any reasonable time to"
"4089","	inspect all books, records, and documents of every kind and the physical"
"4090","	properties of the Trust.  This inspection by a Trustee may be made in"
"4091","	person or by an agent or attorney and the right of inspection includes"
"4092","	the right to copy and make extracts of documents.  No Shareholder shall"
"4093","	have any right to inspect any account or book or document of the Trust"
"4094","	except as conferred by law or otherwise by the Trustees."
"4095","Article VIII"
"4096","AMENDMENTS"
"4097","      These By-laws may be amended by the Trustees of the Trust without any"
"4098","	Shareholder vote."
"4099","Article IX"
"4100","GENERAL MATTERS"
"4101","      Section 1. Checks, Drafts, Evidence of Indebetedness."
"4102","        All checks, drafts, or other orders for payment of money, notes or"
"4103","	other evidences of indebtedness issued in the name of or payable to"
"4104","	the Trust shall be signed or endorsed in such manner and by such"
"4105","	person or persons as shall be designated from time to time in"
"4106","	accordance with the resolution of the Board of Trustees."
"4107","      Section 2. Contracts and Instruments; How Executed."
"4108","        The Trustees, except as otherwise provided in these By-laws, may"
"4109","	authorize any officer or officers, agent or agents, to enter into"
"4110","	any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf"
"4111","	of the Trust and this authority may be general or confined to specific"
"4112","	instances; and unless so authorized or ratified by the Trustees or"
"4113","	within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent, or employee"
"4114","	shall have any power or authority to bind the Trust by any contract or"
"4115","	engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any"
"4116","	purpose or for any amount."
"4117","      Section 3. Advance Payment of Indemnifiable Expenses."
"4118","        Expenses incurred by an agent in connection with the preparation"
"4119","	and presentation of a defense to any proceeding may be paid by the"
"4120","	Trust from time to time prior to final disposition thereof upon"
"4121","	receipt of an undertaking by, or on behalf of, such agent that"
"4122","	such amount will be paid over by him or her to the Trust if it"
"4123","	is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to"
"4124","	indemnification; provided, however, that (a) such agent shall have"
"4125","	provided appropriate security for such undertaking, (b) the Trust"
"4126","	is insured against losses arising out of any such advance payments,"
"4127","	or (c) either a majority of the Trustees who are neither Interested"
"4128","	Persons of the Trust nor parties to the proceeding, or independent"
"4129","	legal counsel in a written opinion, shall have determined, based"
"4130","	upon a review of the readily available facts (as opposed to a"
"4131","	trial-type inquiry or full investigation), that there is reason"
"4132","	to believe that such agent will be found entitled to"
"4133","	indemnification."
"4134","      Section 4. Severability."
"4135","	The provisions of these By-laws are severable.  If the Board of Trustees"
"4136","	determines, with the advice of counsel, that any provision hereof"
"4137","	conflicts with the 1940 Act, the regulated investment company provisions"
"4138","	of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or other applicable"
"4139","	laws and regulations, the conflicting provision shall be deemed never"
"4140","	to have constituted a part of these By-laws; provided, however, that"
"4141","	such determination shall not affect any of the remaining provisions of"
"4142","	these By-laws or render invalid or improper any action taken or omitted"
"4143","	prior to such determination.  If any provision hereof shall be held"
"4144","	invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity or"
"4145","	unenforceability shall attach only to such provision only in such"
"4146","	jurisdiction and shall not affect any other provision of these By-laws."
"4147","      Section 5. Headings."
"4148","        Headings are placed in these By-laws for convenience of reference only"
"4149","	and in case of any conflict, the text of these By-laws rather than the"
"4150","	headings shall control."
