"5694","belonging to such series.  Dividends and"
"5695","distributions may vary between the classes of a"
"5696","series to reflect differing allocations of the"
"5697","expense of each class of that series to such"
"5698","extent and for such purposes as the Board of"
"5699","Directors may deem appropriate.  The Board of"
"5700","Directors shall have the power, in its sole"

"5708","Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or"
"5709","any successor or comparable statute thereto,"

"5717","each series or class that has been established"
"5718","and designated and is being liquidated shall be"

"5720","and as declared by the Board of Directors, the"

"5723","or class.  The holders of shares of any series or"
"5724","class shall not be entitled thereby to any"
"5725","distribution upon liquidation of any other series"
"5726","or class.  The assets so distributable to the"
"5727","stockholders of any particular series or class"
"5728","shall be distributed among such stockholders"
"5729","according to their respective rights taking into"
"5730","account the proper allocation of expenses being"
"5731","borne by that series or class.  The liquidation of"
"5732","assets attributable to any particular series or"

"5734","and the termination of the series or the class"
"5735","may be authorized by vote of a majority of the"
"5736","Board of Directors then in office, without action"
"5737","or approval of the stockholders, to the extent"
"5738","consistent with applicable laws and regulations."
"5739","In the event that there are any general assets"
"5740","not belonging to any particular series or class of"
"5741","stock and available for distribution, such"
"5742","distribution shall be made to holders of stock of"
"5743","various series or classes in such proportion as"
"5744","the Board of Directors determines to be fair and"
"5745","equitable, and such determination by the Board"
"5746","of Directors shall be conclusive and binding for"
"5747","all purposes."
"5748","(5)	Redemption.  All shares of stock of the"
"5749","Corporation shall be subject to the redemption,"
"5750","repurchase and conversion provisions set forth"
"5751","in Sections 5.6 through 5.11 of this Article V."
"5752","(d)	The Corporation's shares of stock are issued and"
"5753","sold, and all persons who shall acquire stock of the"
"5754","Corporation shall do so, subject to the condition and"
"5755","understanding that the provisions of the Corporation's"

"5764","that where the holders of any series or class are required or"
"5765","permitted to vote as a series or class, one-third of the aggregate"
"5766","number of shares of that series or class outstanding and entitled"

"5768","	Notwithstanding any provision of Maryland General"
"5769","Corporation Law requiring a greater proportion than a majority of"

"5775","regulations.  All shares of stock of this Corporation shall have the"
"5776","voting rights provided for in Section 5.1(b) of this Article V."
"5777","	The Board of Directors from time to time, subject to such"
"5778","procedures as may be adopted by the Board of Directors, and"
"5779","consistent with applicable laws and regulations, may authorize the"
"5780","holders of shares of any series or class to take action or consent"
"5781","to any action by delivering a consent, in writing or by electronic"

"5785","series or class."
"5786","	Section 5.3.  No Preemptive or Appraisal Rights:  No"
"5787","holder of shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall, as such"
"5788","holder, have any right to purchase or subscribe for any shares of"
"5789","the capital stock of the Corporation which the Corporation may"
"5790","issue or sell (whether consisting of shares of capital stock"

"5792","stock of the Corporation acquired by it after the issue thereof, or"
"5793","other shares) other than any right which the Board of Directors of"
"5794","the Corporation, in its discretion, may determine."
"5795","	No holder of shares of capital stock of the Corporation"
"5796","shall be entitled to exercise the rights of an objecting stockholder"
"5797","under Subtitle 2 of Title 3 of the Maryland General Corporation"
"5798","Law or any successor provision."
"5799","	Section 5.4.  Determination of Net Asset Value: The net"
"5800","asset value of each share of each series or class of each series of"
"5801","the Corporation shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the"
"5802","value of the net assets of the Corporation, or if applicable of the"
"5803","series or class (being the value of the assets of the Corporation or"

"5820","	Section 5.5.  Stable Net Asset Value:  With respect to"
"5821","any money market, stable value or other series or class that seeks"
"5822","to maintain a stable net asset value per share, and pursuant to"
"5823","procedures established by the Board of Directors, the Corporation"
"5824","shall be entitled, without the payment of monetary compensation"

"9027","Directors as belonging to such series.  Dividends"
"9028","and distributions may vary between the classes of"
"9029","a series to reflect differing allocations of the"
"9030","expense of each class of that series to such extent"
"9031","and for such purposes as the Board of Directors"
"9032","may deem appropriate.  The Board of Directors"
"9033","shall have the power, in its sole discretion, to"

"9041","1986, as amended, or any successor or"
"9042","comparable statute thereto, and regulations"
"9043","promulgated thereunder, and to avoid liability for"

"9049","particular series or class, the stockholders of each"
"9050","series or class that has been established and"
"9051","designated and is being liquidated shall be entitled"
"9052","to receive, as a series or class, when and as"
"9053","declared by the Board of Directors, the excess of"
"9054","the assets belonging to that series or class over"
"9055","the liabilities belonging to that series or class.  The"
"9056","holders of shares of any series or class shall not"
"9057","be entitled thereby to any distribution upon"
"9058","liquidation of any other series or class.  The assets"
"9059","so distributable to the stockholders of any"
"9060","particular series or class shall be distributed"
"9061","among such stockholders according to their"
"9062","respective rights taking into account the proper"
"9063","allocation of expenses being borne by that series"
"9064","or class.  The liquidation of assets attributable to"
"9065","any particular series or class in which there are"
"9066","shares then outstanding and the termination of the"
"9067","series or the class may be authorized by vote of a"
"9068","majority of the Board of Directors then in office,"
"9069","without action or approval of the stockholders, to"
"9070","the extent consistent with applicable laws and"
"9071","regulations.  In the event that there are any general"
"9072","assets not belonging to any particular series or"
"9073","class of stock and available for distribution, such"
"9074","distribution shall be made to holders of stock of"
"9075","various series or classes in such proportion as the"
"9076","Board of Directors determines to be fair and"
"9077","equitable, and such determination by the Board of"
"9078","Directors shall be conclusive and binding for all"
"9079","purposes."
"9080","(5)	Redemption.  All shares of stock of the Corporation"
"9081","shall be subject to the redemption, repurchase and"
"9082","conversion provisions set forth in Sections 5.6"
"9083","through 5.11 of this Article V."
"9084","(d)	The Corporation's shares of stock are issued and sold,"
"9085","and all persons who shall acquire stock of the"
"9086","Corporation shall do so, subject to the condition and"
"9087","understanding that the provisions of the Corporation's"

"9107","Section 5.1(b) of this Article V."
"9108","	The Board of Directors from time to time, subject to such"
"9109","procedures as may be adopted by the Board of Directors, and"
"9110","consistent with applicable laws and regulations, may authorize the"
"9111","holders of shares of any series or class to take action or consent to"

"9115","take the action at a meeting of the holders of shares of such series or"
"9116","class."
"9117","	Section 5.3.  No Preemptive or Appraisal Rights:  No"

"9125","may determine."
"9126","	No holder of shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall"
"9127","be entitled to exercise the rights of an objecting stockholder under"
"9128","Subtitle 2 of Title 3 of the Maryland General Corporation Law or any"
"9129","successor provision."
"9130","	Section 5.4.  Determination of Net Asset Value: The net"
"9131","asset value of each share of each series or class of each series of"
"9132","the Corporation shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the value of"
"9133","the net assets of the Corporation, or if applicable of the series or"
"9134","class (being the value of the assets of the Corporation or of the"
"9135","particular series or class or attributable to the particular series or"
"9136","class less its actual and accrued liabilities exclusive of capital stock"
"9137","and surplus), by the total number of outstanding shares of the"

"9140","class-by-class basis, as appropriate, and shall include any expenses"
"9141","allocated to a specific series or class thereof.  The Board of Directors"
"9142","may adopt procedures for determination of net asset value consistent"
"9143","with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations and, so far"
"9144","as accounting matters are concerned, with generally accepted"
"9145","accounting principles.  The procedures may include, without"

"9147","securities and other assets, for accrual of expenses or creation of"
"9148","reserves and for the determination of the number of shares issued"
"9149","and outstanding at any given time."
"9150","	Section 5.5.  Stable Net Asset Value:  With respect to any"
"9151","money market, stable value or other series or class that seeks to"
"9152","maintain a stable net asset value per share, and pursuant to"
"9153","procedures established by the Board of Directors, the Corporation"
"9154","shall be entitled, without the payment of monetary compensation but"
"9155","in consideration of the interest of the Corporation and its stockholders"
"9156","in maintaining a stable net asset value per share of such series or"
"9157","class, to redeem pro rata from all holders of record of such series or"

"9455","AGREEMENT executed as of the July 23, 2013, by and between"
"9456","PRINCIPAL MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, an Iowa corporation"
"9457","(hereinafter called the Manager), and YORK REGISTERED"
"9458","HOLDINGS, L.P., a Delaware Limited Partnership (hereinafter called the
Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each
series of the Principal  Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end
management investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it
with portfolio selection  in connection with the investment advisory
services for each series of the Fund identified in Appendix A ( hereinafter
called the Series), which the Manager has agreed to provide to the
Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to furnish such services on the terms
and conditions set forth herein;; and

WHEREAS, the Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies
properly certified or authenticated of each of the following :

 (a)	The Amended and Restated Management Agreement dated
March 31, 2013, between the Fund and the Manager (the
Management Agreement) with the Fund;

 (b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

 (c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and
services provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement,
the Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the
services described in Section 2 below for investment and
reinvestment of the securities and other assets of the Series,
subject to the supervision and direction of the Manager and the
Fund's Board of Directors, for the period and on the terms
hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts such appointment
and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter set forth for the
compensation herein provided. The Sub-Advisor shall provide
such services with respect to the portion of the assets of the
Series allocated to it for management from time to time by the
Manager.  The Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be
deemed to be an independent contractor and shall, except as
expressly provided or authorized herein, have no authority to act
for or represent the Fund or the Manager in any way or
otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

 (a) 	The Sub-Advisor will:
(i)    Provide investment advisory services, including but not
limited to research, advice and supervision for the
Series.

(ii)	Furnish to the Board of Directors  for approval (or any
appropriate committee of such Board of Directors), and
revise from time to time as economic conditions require,
a recommended investment program for the Series
consistent with the Series' written investment objective
and policies.
(iii)	Implement the approved investment program by placing
orders for the purchase, sale and exchange of securities,
commodity interests (as defined in the Commodity
Exchange Act, as amended) and other financial
instruments  without prior consultation with the Manager
and without regard to the length of time the securities
and other financial instruments have been held, the
resulting rate of portfolio turnover or any tax
considerations, subject always to  (i) the provisions of
the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and (ii)
the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same
shall be from time to time in effect.

(iv)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as reasonably
requested by the officers, in taking such steps as are
reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the
decisions of its Board of Directors, and any appropriate
committees of such Board, regarding the general
conduct of the investment business of the Series.

(v)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's
investment advisory services provided to the Series, its
compliance with the 1940 Act and the regulations
adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) thereunder and the Series' investment strategies
and restrictions as stated in the Fund's prospectus and
statement of additional information (together , the
Registration Statement), subject to receipt of such
additional information as may be required from the
Manager and provided in accordance with Section 11(d)
of this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility
for the maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is
directly related to the services it provides to the Series.

(vi)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such
times and in such detail as the Board of Directors may
reasonably deem appropriate in order to enable it to
determine that the investment policies, procedures and
approved investment program of the Series are being
observed.

(vii)	Upon request, provide reasonable assistance in the
determination of the fair value of certain securities when
reliable market quotations are not readily available for
purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance
with procedures and methods established by the  Board
of Directors.

(viii)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment
and management facilities, including salaries of clerical
and other personnel required for it to execute its duties
faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including
bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment
necessary for the efficient conduct of its duties under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cost of
the securities or other investment instruments purchased
or sold or held by the Fund (including taxes, brokerage
commissions and other applicable transaction and
custodial costs, interest payable on any margin loans
and other Fund borrowings, and dividend and interest
expenses on short positions, if any), shall be solely
borne by the Fund.

(ix)	Open accounts with broker-dealers,  futures commission
merchants, banks and other financial institutions
(collectively broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to
effect all transactions for the Series, place all necessary
orders with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated
broker-dealers), and negotiate commissions, if
applicable. To the extent consistent with applicable law,
purchase or sell orders for the Series may be
aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell
orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event
allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as
the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by
the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor
considers to be the most equitable and consistent with
its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to other clients
of the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates over time.  The
Manager recognizes that, in some cases, this procedure
may limit the size of the position that may be acquired or
sold for the Series and that aggregation of orders may
not result in more favorable pricing or lower brokerage
commissions in all instances. At the Manager's request,
the Sub-Advisor will provide the Manager with the
information required pursuant to Rule 31a-1(b)(9) of the
1940 Act.   The Sub-Advisor will effect transactions with
those broker-dealers which it believes provide favorable
net prices and are capable of providing efficient
executions, taking into consideration, among other
things, order size, difficulty of execution, the operational
capabilities, facilities and financial condition of the
broker-dealer involved, whether that broker-dealer has
risked its own capital in positioning a block of securities
or other assets, and the prior experience of the broker-
dealer in effecting transactions of the relevant types. The
Sub-Advisor's primary objective will be to obtain best
execution with respect to all transactions for the Series
However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers-dealers
on the basis that they provide brokerage, research or
other services or products to the Sub-Advisor or its
affiliates. To the extent consistent with applicable law,
the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount
of commission for effecting a securities transaction in
excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread
another broker- dealer would have charged for effecting
that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good
faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in
relation to the value of the brokerage and research
products and/or services provided by such broker-
dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage
and research products and/or services, may be viewed
in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates
have with respect to the Series and other accounts over
which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such
services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in
managing the Series. In addition, joint repurchase or
other accounts may not be utilized by the Series except
to the extent permitted under any exemptive order
obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions
of such order are complied with.

(x)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to
the Series as are required of an investment adviser of a
registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act
and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended
(the Investment Advisers Act), and the rules
thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with
such periodic and special reports as the Fund or
Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with
the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the
Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it
maintains for the Series are the property of the Fund,
agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule
31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains
for the Fund and that are required to be maintained by
Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to
surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it
maintains for the Series upon request by the Fund or the
Manager. The Sub-Advisor may retain copies of any
such records.

(xi)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act
and the Sub-Advisor's code of ethics (the Code of"
"9459","Ethics) adopted pursuant to  Rule 17j-1 as the same
may be amended from time to time.  The Manager
acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current
Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to
the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics.

(xii)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may
request, furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio
transactions and reports on investments held by the
Series, all in such detail as the Manager or the Fund
may reasonably request.  The Sub-Advisor will make
available its personnel to meet with the Fund's Board of
Directors at the Fund's principal place of business on
reasonable prior notice to review the investments of the
Series.

(xiii)	Provide such additional information in the possession of
the Sub-Advisor or its affiliates  may  be required for the
Fund or the Manager to comply with their respective
obligations under applicable laws, including, without
limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment
Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and
any rule or regulation thereunder.  Sub-Advisor will
advise Manager of any changes in Sub-Advisor's Senior
Management (i.e. Chief Investment Officer and/or Chief
Executive Officer) within a reasonable time after any
such change.  Manager acknowledges receipt of Sub-
Advisor's Form ADV more than 48 hours prior to the
execution of this Agreement.

(xiv)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies
solicited by, or with respect to, the issuers of securities
held in the Series in accordance with the Sub-Advisor's
proxy voting policy as most recently provided to the
Manager. The Sub-Advisor's obligations in the previous
sentence are contingent upon its timely receipt of  such
proxy solicitation materials from the Manager.  The
Manager shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor all
proxy solicitation materials that it receives and shall
assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the proxy
voting process.

(b)	The Sub-Advisor is hereby authorized to prepare and file all
documentation in connection with its management of the Series,
including proofs of claim, evidence of indebtedness, related
bankruptcy and  insolvency filings and other similar filings on
behalf of the Fund.

    3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-
Advisor will not consult with any other investment advisory firm
that provides investment advisory services to any investment
company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company
regarding transactions for the Fund in securities or other assets.
The Manager agrees to provide a list of such other investment
advisory firms to the Sub-Advisor, such list to be promptly
updated by the Manager upon any changes thereto.

    4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the
Fund, the Manager shall pay the compensation specified in
Appendix A to this Agreement.

    5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its partners, members,
directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable
to the Manager, the Board of Directors, the Fund or its
shareholders for any claim, expense or other  loss suffered by
the Manager or the Fund resulting from any error of judgment

facilities to the Sub- Advisor, subject to written notification to and
approval of the Manager and, where required by applicable law,
the Board of Directors.

Directors  who are not interested persons of the Manager,
Principal Life Insurance Company, the Sub-Advisor or the Fund

such approval.

If the Board of Directors or the shareholders of a Series fail to
approve the Agreement or any continuance of the Agreement in
accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Sub-
Advisor will continue to act as Sub-Advisor with respect to the
Series pending the required approval of the Agreement or its
continuance or of any contract with the Sub-Advisor or a different
manager or Sub-Advisor or other definitive action; provided, that
the compensation received by the Sub-Advisor in respect to the
Series during such period is in compliance with Rule 15a-4 under
the 1940 Act.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time without the
payment of any penalty by the Board of Directors of the Fund or
by the Sub-Advisor, or the Manager or by vote of a majority of
the outstanding voting securities of the Series, in each case, on
sixty days written notice. This Agreement shall automatically
terminate in the event of its assignment. In interpreting the
provisions of this Section 9, the definitions contained in Section
2(a) of the 1940 Act (particularly the definitions of interested"

or otherwise affect their construction or effect.

(b) Any notice under this Agreement shall be in writing, addressed
and delivered or mailed postage pre-paid to        the other party

Counsel.

(c)	The Sub-Advisor will promptly notify the Manager in writing of the
occurrence of any of the following events:

(1)	the Sub-Advisor fails to be registered as an investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act or under the

required to be registered as an investment advisor in
order to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

(2)	the Sub-Advisor is served or otherwise receives notice of
any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, at
law or in equity, before or by any court, public board or
body, specifically naming the Fund or involving the
affairs of the Fund that would be reasonably expected to
have a material adverse impact on the Fund.

provide) timely information to the Sub-Advisor regarding such
matters as the composition of the assets of the Series, cash
requirements and cash available for investment in the Series,
and all other reasonable information as may be necessary for the
Sub-Advisor to perform its duties and responsibilities hereunder.

(e)  The Sub-Advisor represents that it will not enter into any
agreement, oral or written, or other understanding under which
the Fund directs or is expected to direct portfolio securities
transactions, or any remuneration, to a broker or dealer in
consideration for the promotion or sale of Fund shares or shares
issued by any other registered investment company. Sub-
Advisor further represents that it is contrary to the Sub-Advisor's
policies to permit those who select brokers or dealers for
execution of fund portfolio securities transactions to take into
account the broker or dealer's promotion or sale of Fund shares
or shares issued by any other registered investment company.

in any way refer directly or indirectly to its relationship with the
Fund, the Series, or the Manager or any of their respective
affiliates in offering, marketing or other promotional materials
without the express written consent of the Manager; provided,
however, that the Manager consents to the Sub-Advisor's use of
the Manager's name and the Fund name in the Sub-Advisor's
representative client list that may be distributed to potential and
existing clients so long as this Agreement is in effect.

(h)  The Sub-Advisor shall provide investment advisory services to
the Series on a non-exclusive basis.  In         particular, the
Manager hereby acknowledges and agrees that, during the term
of this Agreement, the          Sub-Advisor and its affiliated
persons trade or may trade for their own accounts (or the
accounts of              family members, friends or investment

investment companies, funds, vehicles and           accounts
managed or advised by the Sub-Advisor or its affiliated persons
(each, including the Series, a        York Fund) with investment
objectives and strategies that are the same as, or overlap with,
those of           the Series and may include York Funds in which

law, rule or regulation.

(j) 	The Sub-Advisor shall promptly notify the Manager of the

applicable law, rule or regulation.

(k) 	Each party represents, warrants and covenants to the other party
that (i) it has all requisite power and         authority to enter into

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm
The Shareholders and Board of
Directors
Principal Funds, Inc.
In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements
of Blue Chip Fund, Bond Market Index Fund, Diversified Real
Asset Fund, Global Multi-Strategy Fund, Global Opportunities
Fund, International Equity Index Fund, Opportunistic Municipal
Fund, Preferred Securities Fund, and Small-MidCap Dividend
Income Fund, (9 of the portfolios constituting the Principal Funds,
Inc. (collectively the Funds)) as of and for the period ended
August 31, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we
considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,
including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for
designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing
our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the
requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion.
The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In
fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by
management are required to assess the expected benefits and
related costs of controls. A company's internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists
when the design or operation of a control does not allow
management or employees, in the normal course of performing
their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a
timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of
the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial
reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first
paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in
internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards
established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds'
internal control over financial reporting and its operation,
including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to
be a material weakness as defined above as of August 31, 2013.
This report is intended solely for the information and use of
management and the Board of Directors of the Funds and the
Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and
should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

"9543","(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of"
"9544","the fair value of certain securities when reliable market"
"9545","quotations are not readily available for purposes of"

"9560","orders for the Series may be aggregated with"
"9561","contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of other clients of"
"9562","the Sub-Advisor. In such event allocation of securities so"
"9563","sold or purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in the"
"9564","transaction, will be made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner"
"9565","the Sub-Advisor considers to be the most equitable and"
"9566","consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to"
"9567","other clients.  The Manager recognizes that, in some cases,"
"9568","this procedure may limit the size of the position that may be"
"9569","acquired or sold for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor will report"
"9570","on such allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund"
"9571","or the Fund's Board of Directors providing such information"
"9572","as the number of aggregated trades to which the Series"

"9576","execution of transactions for the Series at prices which are"
"9577","advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that"
"9578","are reasonable in relation to the benefits received."
"9579","However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on"
"9580","the basis that they provide brokerage, research or other"
"9581","services or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent"
"9582","consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a"
"9583","broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a"
"9584","securities transaction in excess of the amount of"
"9585","commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer"
"9586","would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-"
"9587","Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of"
"9588","commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"9589","brokerage and research products and/or services provided"
"9590","by such broker or dealer. This determination, with respect"
"9591","to brokerage and research products and/or services, may"
"9592","be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"9593","the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its"
"9594","affiliates have with respect to the Series as well as to"
"9595","accounts over which they exercise investment discretion."
"9596","Not all such services or products need be used by the Sub-"
"9597","Advisor in managing the Series. In addition, joint"
"9598","repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by the"
"9599","Series except to the extent permitted under any exemptive"
"9600","order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all"
"9601","conditions of such order are complied with."
"9602","(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the"
"9603","Series as are required of an investment advisor of a"
"9604","registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act"

Advisers Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the"
"9606","Fund and the Manager with such periodic and special"
"9607","reports as the Fund or Manager may reasonably request."
"9608","In compliance with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under"
"9609","the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all"
"9610","records that it maintains for the Series are the property of"
"9611","the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by"
"9612","Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains"
"9613","for the Fund and that are required to be maintained by Rule"
"9614","31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender"
"9615","promptly to the Fund any records that it maintains for the"
"9616","Series upon request by the Fund or the Manager."
"9617","(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act"
"9618","and the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to"
"9619","that Rule as the same may be amended from time to time."

"9621","Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall"
"9622","promptly forward to the Manager a copy of any material"
