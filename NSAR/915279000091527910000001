"1456","LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"1457","Since October 2003, Federated and related entities"
"1458","(collectively, Federated), and various Federated"
"1459","funds (Funds), have been named"
"1460","as defendants in several class action lawsuits now"
"1461","pending in the United States District Court for the"
"1462"," District of Maryland. The lawsuits"
"1463","were purportedly filed on behalf of people who purc"
"1464","hased, owned and/or redeemed shares of Federated-sp"
"1465","onsored mutual funds during"
"1466","specified periods beginning November 1, 1998. The s"
"1467","uits are generally similar in alleging that Federate"
"1468","d engaged in illegal and"
"1469","improper trading practices including market timing a"
"1470","nd late trading in concert with certain institutional"
"1471"," traders, which allegedly caused"
"1472","financial injury to the mutual fund shareholders. Th"
"1473","ese lawsuits began to be filed shortly after Federat"
"1474","ed's first public announcement"
"1475","that it had received requests for information on shar"
"1476","eholder trading activities in the Funds from the SEC,"
"1477","the Office of the New York"
"1478","State Attorney General (NYAG), and other authoritie"
"1479","s. In that regard, on November 28, 2005, Federated ann"
"1480","ounced that it had"
"1481","reached final settlements with the SEC and the NYAG wi"
"1482","th respect to those matters. Specifically, the SEC and"
"1483"," NYAG settled"
"1484","proceedings against three Federated subsidiaries invol"
"1485","ving undisclosed market timing arrangements and late t"
"1486","rading. The SEC made"
"1487","findings: that Federated Investment Management Compan"
"1488","y (FIMC), an SEC-registered investment adviser to v"
"1489","arious Funds, and"
"1490","Federated Securities Corp., an SEC-registered broker-"
"1491","dealer and distributor for the Funds, violated provisi"
"1492","ons of the Investment Advisers"
"1493","Act and Investment Company Act by approving, but not d"
"1494","isclosing, three market timing arrangements, or the as"
"1495","sociated conflict of"
"1496","interest between FIMC and the funds involved in the ar"
"1497","rangements, either to other fund shareholders or to the"
"1498"," funds' board; and that"
"1499","Federated Shareholder Services Company, formerly an SE"
"1500","C-registered transfer agent, failed to prevent a custom"
"1501","er and a Federated"
"1502","employee from late trading in violation of provisions o"
"1503","f the Investment Company Act. The NYAG found that such"
"1504","conduct violated"
"1505","provisions of New York State law. Federated entered into"
"1506"," the settlements without admitting or denying the regu"
"1507","lators' findings. As"
"1508","Federated previously reported in 2004, it has already"
"1509","paid approximately $8.0 million to certain funds as det"
"1510","ermined by an independent"
"1511","consultant. As part of these settlements, Federated ag"
"1512","reed to pay disgorgement and a civil money penalty in t"
"1513","he aggregate amount of"
"1514","an additional $72 million and, among other things, agre"
"1515","ed that it would not serve as investment adviser to any"
"1516"," registered investment"
"1517","company unless (i) at least 75% of the fund's directors"
"1518"," are independent of Federated, (ii) the chairman of each"
"1519","such fund is"
"1520","independent of Federated, (iii) no action may be taken"
"1521","by the fund's board or any committee thereof unless app"
"1522","roved by a majority of"
"1523","the independent trustees of the fund or committee, resp"
"1524","ectively, and (iv) the fund appoints a senior officer"
"1525","who reports to the"
"1526","independent trustees and is responsible for monitoring"
"1527","compliance by the fund with applicable laws and fiduciar"
"1528","y duties and for"
"1529","managing the process by which management fees charged t"
"1530","o a fund are approved. The settlements are described in"
"1531"," Federated's"
"1532","announcement which, along with previous press releases"
"1533","and related communications on those matters, is availabl"
"1534","e in the About Us"
"1535","section of Federated's website at FederatedInvestors.co"
"1536","m."
"1537","Federated entities have also been named as defendants in"
"1538"," several additional lawsuits that are now pending in th"
"1539","e United States"
"1540","District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania,"
"1541"," alleging, among other things, excessive advisory and R"
"1542","ule 12b-1 fees."
"1543","The Board of the Funds retained the law firm of Dickstein"
"1544"," Shapiro LLP to represent the Funds in each of the lawsui"
"1545","ts described in"
"1546","the preceding two paragraphs. Federated and the Funds, a"
"1547","nd their respective counsel, have been defending this li"
"1548","tigation, and none of"
"1549","the Funds remains a defendant in any of the lawsuits (th"
"1550","ough some could potentially receive any recoveries as no"
"1551","minal defendants)."
"1552","Additional lawsuits based upon similar allegations may b"
"1553","e filed in the future. The potential impact of these laws"
"1554","uits, all of which seek"
"1555","unquantified damages, attorneys' fees, and expenses, and"
"1556","future potential similar suits is uncertain. Although we"
"1557"," do not believe that"
"1558","these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on th"
"1559","e Funds, there can be no assurance that these suits, ongo"
"1560","ing adverse publicity"
"1561","and/or other developments resulting from the regulatory"
"1562","investigations will not result in increased Fund redemption"
"1563","s, reduced sales of"
"1564","Fund shares, or other adverse consequences for the Funds."

"1601","the reliability of financial reporting and the prepar"
"1602","ation of financial statements for external"
"1603","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accou"
