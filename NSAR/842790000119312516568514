"2725","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"2726","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Investment Securities Funds"
"2727","(Invesco Investment Securities Funds):"
"2728","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of Invesco"
"2729","Corporate Bond Fund, Invesco Global Real Estate Fund, Invesco High Yield Fund,"
"2730","Invesco Money Market Fund, Invesco Real Estate Fund, Invesco Short Duration"
"2731","Inflation Protected Fund (formerly known as Invesco Limited Maturity Treasury"
"2732","Fund), Invesco Short Term Bond Fund and Invesco U.S. Government Fund (hereafter"
"2733","referred to as the Funds), as of and for the year ended February 29, 2016, in"
"2734","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"2735","(United States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2736","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"2737","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"2738","the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"2739","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"2740","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an"
"2741","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2742","reporting."
"2743","Management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2744","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"2745","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"2746","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"2747","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2748","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2749","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2750","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"2751","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"2752","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"2753","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"2754","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"2755","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2756","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"2757","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"2758","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2759","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"2760","a material effect on the financial statements."
"2761","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2762","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2763","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"2764","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"2765","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2766","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"2767","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"2768","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2769","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2770","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
