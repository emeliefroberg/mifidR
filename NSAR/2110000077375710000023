"2495","77B Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"2496","To the Board of Directors and Shareholders"
"2497","Of the Funds (hereinafter defined)"
"2498","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"2499"," of Columbia Acorn Fund, Columbia Acorn International, Columbia"
"2500","Acorn USA, Columbia Acorn International Select, Columbia Acorn"
"2501","Select and Columbia Thermostat Fund (the Funds) as of and for"
"2502","the year ended December 31, 2009, in accordance with the standards"
"2503","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"2504","we considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"2505","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"2506","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"2507","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2508","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"2509","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"2510","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"2511","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2512","reporting."
"2513","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"2514","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"2515","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"2516","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"2517","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"2518","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2519","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2520","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2521","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"2522","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"2523","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"2524","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"2525","fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"2526","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"2527","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"2528","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"2529","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund;"
"2530","and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"2531","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"2532","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2533","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2534","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"2535","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"2536","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2537","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"2538","procedures may deteriorate."
"2539","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"2540","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"2541","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"2542","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A"
"2543","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"2544","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"2545","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds'"
"2546","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"2547","detected on a timely basis."
"2548","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2549","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"2550","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"2551","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"2552","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"2553","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"2554","no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2555","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"2556","securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"2557","above as of December 31, 2009."
"2558","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"2559","management and the Board of Directors of the Funds and the"
"2560","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be"
"2561","and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"2562","parties."

"2564","Chicago, Illinois"
"2565","February 18, 2010"
"2566","Item 77E - Legal Proceedings"
"2567","	I.	Vogeler v. Columbia Acorn Trust, et al.,"
"2568","                No. 03 L 1550, Circuit Court,"
"2569","		Third Judicial Circuit, Madison County, Ill."
"2570","	On November 13, 2003, the above-captioned lawsuit was filed"
"2571","against Columbia Acorn Trust (CAT) and Columbia Wanger Asset"
"2572","Management, L.P. (CWAM), in the Circuit Court of the Third Judicial"
"2573","Circuit, Madison County, Illinois (Madison County), seeking"
"2574","certification of a plaintiff class consisting of all persons in the"
"2575","United States who held shares in Columbia Acorn International (Acorn
International) for a period of more than 14 days during the five"
"2576","years prior to and through the filing of the lawsuit."
"2577","	The Vogeler complaint is pleaded in two counts and alleges,"
"2578","in summary, that CWAM and CAT exposed long-term shareholders of Acorn"
"2579","International to trading by market timers by allegedly: (a) failing to"
"2580","properly evaluate daily whether a significant event affecting the value"
"2581","of Acorn International's portfolio securities had occurred after"
"2582","foreign markets had closed but before the calculation of Acorn"
"2583","International's net asset value (NAV); (b) failing to implement"
"2584","Acorn International's portfolio valuation and share pricing policies"
"2585","and procedures; (c) allowing portfolio valuation and share pricing"
"2586","policies and procedures that benefited market timers at the expense of"
"2587","long-term shareholders; and (d) failing to know and implement applicable"
"2588","rules and regulations concerning the calculation of NAV.  Count I of the"
"2589","Complaint alleges that the defendants breached duties of care owed to"
"2590","Acorn International shareholders, and Count II alleges that the asserted"
"2591","breaches were willful and wanton.  Both counts of the Complaint seek"
"2592","unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, prejudgment interest,"
"2593","costs and attorneys' fees."
"2594","	On December 12, 2003, the defendants removed the Vogeler case"
"2595","to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois,"
"2596","Case No. 03-cv-843.  On February 12, 2004, the federal district court"
"2597","remanded the case back to the Illinois state court in Madison County."
"2598","The defendants filed a timely appeal of the remand order."
"2599","	On April 5, 2005 the United States Court of Appeals for the"
"2600","Seventh Circuit (the Seventh Circuit) issued an Opinion in several"
"2601","fair value pricing cases, including Vogeler.  The Seventh Circuit"
"2602","reversed the federal district courts' remand of those cases to state"
"2603","court, holding that the plaintiffs' state law claims were preempted"
"2604","by federal law under the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act"
"2605","of 1998 (SLUSA).  The Seventh Circuit remanded the cases, including"
"2606","Vogeler, to the district courts with instructions to undo the remand"
"2607","orders and dismiss the plaintiffs' complaints with prejudice."
"2608","Plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion with the district court to amend"
"2609","the Vogeler complaint to plead around the Seventh Circuit's federal"
"2610","preemption ruling.  However, consistent with the mandate, the federal"
"2611","district court denied plaintiffs' motion to amend and dismissed the"
"2612","Vogeler complaint with prejudice."
"2613","	Plaintiffs then filed a writ of certiorari with the United"
"2614","States Supreme Court seeking to appeal the Seventh Circuit's decision."
"2615","The writ challenged whether the district court's remand of the case to"
"2616","state court was reviewable by the Seventh Circuit on appeal (the"
"2617","jurisdictional issue) and whether plaintiffs' claims were federally"
"2618","preempted under SLUSA because they alleged misconduct in connection
with the purchase or sale of securities (the substantive issue)."
"2619","The Seventh Circuit's decision of SLUSA preclusion created a conflict"
"2620","with the Second Circuit's decision in Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner"
"2621","& Smith, Inc. v. Dabit (Dabit)."
"2622","	On January 6, 2006, the Supreme Court granted review of the"
"2623","appellate jurisdiction issue and, given the pendency of the Dabit"
"2624","appeal, held the appeal of the substantive SLUSA preclusion issue. On"
"2625","June 15, 2006, the Supreme Court held that the Seventh Circuit did not"
"2626","have appellate jurisdiction to review the district court's remand"
"2627","order, and remanded the case to the Seventh Circuit which, in turn,"
"2628","dismissed the appeals and remanded the case to state court."
"2629","	The parties have entered into an agreement in principle to"
"2630","settle all claims against the Columbia Defendants, including CAT and"
"2631","CWAM, which must be approved by the Court.  The terms and provisions of"
"2632","the proposed agreement are confidential.  In light of the agreement in"
"2633","principle, the state court has stayed all proceedings in the Vogeler case."
"2634","	II.	In re: Mutual Funds Investment Litigation,"
"2635","                No. 04-MDL-1586; U.S. Dist. Ct. Md."
"2636","	Commencing in late 2003, several class action and derivative"
"2637","lawsuits were filed in federal district courts naming, among others, CAT"
"2638","and the Trustees of CAT, challenging the existence of consensual market"
"2639","timing arrangements, frequent trading and late trading.  In September"
"2640","2003, motions were filed by various mutual fund defendants seeking to"
"2641","centralize or consolidate all actions filed in federal district courts"
"2642","involving market timing-related allegations into one multidistrict"
"2643","(MDL) proceeding.  On February 20, 2004, an Order was entered"
"2644","transferring all federal district court cases involving market timing-"
"2645","related allegations to the United States District Court for the"
"2646","District of Maryland."
"2647","	On September 29, 2004, plaintiffs in the class action track"
"2648","filed a consolidated amended class action complaint in the Multi-"
"2649","District Litigation styled Dukes, et al. v. Columbia Acorn Funds,"
"2650","et al., Case No. 04-cv-01763, which names as defendants CAT, and"
"2651","Ralph Wanger and Charles McQuaid as interested Trustees of CAT. The"
"2652","independent CAT Trustees are not named as defendants (although"
"2653","certain independent trustees of the Columbia Funds trusts are named)."
"2654","Also on September 29, 2004, plaintiffs in the derivative actions"
"2655","brought on behalf of shareholders in numerous fund complexes filed"
"2656","a consolidated amended derivative action complaint styled Slaybe,"
"2657","et al. v. Columbia Management Advisers, Inc., et al., Case No. 04-cv-"
"2658","1768, which names CAT and Columbia Acorn Fund as nominal defendants"
"2659","and the ten CAT Trustees as defendants. Judge J. Frederick Motz is"
"2660","assigned to the Columbia track.  Defendants filed motions to dismiss"
"2661","the consolidated amended class action and derivative action complaints."
"2662","Ultimately, Judge Motz issued Orders dismissing all claims against the"
"2663","Funds and the independent trustees."
"2664","	As indicated in Section I above, the parties reached an"
"2665","agreement in principle to settle all claims against the Columbia"
"2666","Defendants, including the Funds and the CAT Trustees, which was"
"2667","memorialized in a term sheet.  The terms and provisions of the proposed"
"2668","agreement are confidential.  In light of the agreement in principle,"
"2669","Judge Motz has stayed these proceedings against the Columbia Defendants."
"2670","	On September 14, 2007, the plaintiffs and the defendants named"
"2671","in these proceedings entered into a formal stipulation of settlement"
"2672","with respect to all claims against the Columbia Defendants.  The"
"2673","settlement is subject to approval by the Court."
"2674","	III.	Delaventura v. Columbia Acorn Trust, et al.,"
"2675","                Superior Court,"
"2676","		Commonwealth of Mass., Case No. 05-1093"
"2677","	On March 21, 2005, a one-count breach of contract class action"
"2678","complaint was filed against several of the Columbia Registrants,"
"2679","including CAT, seeking to rescind the Contingent Deferred Sales Charges"
"2680","assessed upon redemption of Class B shares of Columbia mutual funds"
"2681","due to the alleged market timing misconduct of defendants.  The"
"2682","Trustees are not named as defendants.  In addition to the rescission"
"2683","of sales charges, plaintiffs seek recovery of actual damages, attorneys'"
"2684","fees and costs."
"2685","	On April 20, 2005, the defendants removed the case to the United"
"2686","States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  CAT was"
"2687","voluntarily dismissed from the complaint by plaintiffs."
"2688","	As discussed in preceding sections, the parties entered into"
"2689","an agreement in principle to settle all claims against the Columbia"
"2690","defendants, including the Deleventue case, subject to approval by the"
"2691","Court.  The terms and provisions of the proposed agreement are"
"2692","confidential and the litigation has been stayed."
