"4135","(THE FUND)"
"4136","77D(g)"
"4137","Policies with respect to security investments"
"4138","On May 21, 2013, the Board of Trustees of BlackRock Funds (the"
"4139","Trust), approved a proposal to amend the Fund's investment"
"4140","objective and strategies and to change the name of the Fund to"
"4141","BlackRock Emerging Markets Dividend Fund. The changes became"
"4142","effective on August 16, 2013."
"4143","The Fund's primary investment objective will be to seek"
"4144","investment income and, as a secondary objective, to seek"
"4145","capital appreciation. The Fund will be restructured to pursue"
"4146","a strategy providing access to broader emerging market"
"4147","investment opportunities."
"4148","Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80%"
"4149","of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment"
"4150","purposes) in equity securities of companies domiciled in, or"
"4151","tied economically to, emerging market countries and at least"
"4152","80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment"
"4153","purposes) in dividend-paying securities. This policy is a non-"
"4154","fundamental policy of the Fund and may not be changed without"
"4155","60 days' prior notice to the Fund's shareholders. Equity"
"4156","securities consist primarily of common stock, preferred stock,"
"4157","securities convertible into common stock, non-convertible"
"4158","preferred stock, depositary receipts and securities or other"
"4159","instruments whose price is linked to the value of common"
"4160","stock."
"4161","BlackRock considers an emerging market country to include any"
"4162","country that is: 1) generally recognized to be an emerging"
"4163","market country by the international financial community,"
"4164","including the World Bank; 2) classified by the United Nations"
"4165","as a developing country; or 3) included in the MSCI Emerging"
"4166","Markets Index. BlackRock determines that an investment is tied"
"4167","economically to an emerging market if such investment"
"4168","satisfies one or more of the following conditions: 1) the"
"4169","issuer's primary trading market is in an emerging market; 2)"
"4170","the issuer is organized under the laws of, derives at least"
"4171","50% of its revenue from, or has at least 50% of its assets in"
"4172","emerging markets; 3) the investment is included in an index"
"4173","representative of emerging markets; and 4) the investment is"
"4174","exposed to the economic risks and returns of emerging markets."
"4175","The Fund may also invest in pre-emerging markets, also known"
"4176","as frontier markets, which are emerging market countries that"
"4177","are considered to be among the smallest, least mature and"
"4178","least liquid."
"4179","The Fund may invest in securities of both U.S. and non-U.S."
"4180","issuers, which can be both U.S. dollar-based and non-U.S."
"4181","dollar-based and may be currency hedged or unhedged. Fund"
"4182","management anticipates that under most circumstances the"
"4183","Fund's investments will primarily be denominated in foreign"
"4184","currencies. The Fund may invest in securities of companies of"
"4185","any market capitalization."
"4186","The Fund may invest in derivatives, including, but not limited"
"4187","to, options, futures, options on futures and swaps and foreign"
"4188","currency transactions, for hedging purposes, as well as to"
"4189","increase the return on its portfolio investments. The Fund may"
"4190","also use forward foreign currency exchange contracts"
"4191","(obligations to buy or sell a currency at a set rate in the"
"4192","future) to hedge against movement in the value of non-U.S."
"4193","currencies. The Fund's exposure to certain markets may be"
"4194","effected through investments in participation notes or other"
"4195","structured or derivative instruments that are designed to"
"4196","replicate, or otherwise provide exposure to, the performance"
"4197","of securities listed in such markets."
"4198","The Fund may invest in shares of companies through an initial"
"4199","public offering."
"4200","The Fund is currently classified as non-diversified but, in"
"4201","connection with its new strategies, intends to operate as a"
"4202","diversified fund."

"4821","authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority."
"4822","      III.   Covenants."
"4823","            A.   In the performance of its duties under this"
"4824","Agreement, the Sub-Advisor shall at all times conform to, and"
"4825","act in accordance with, any requirements imposed by:  (i) the"
"4826","provisions of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of"
"4827","1940, as amended (the Advisers Act) and all applicable Rules"
"4828","and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the"
"4829","SEC); (ii) any other applicable provision of law; (iii) the"
"4830","provisions of the Declaration of Trust and By-Laws of the"
"4831","Trust, as such documents are amended from time to time; (iv)"
"4832","the investment objectives and policies of the Fund as set"
"4833","forth in the Fund's Registration Statement on Form N-1A and/or"
"4834","the resolutions of the Board of Trustees; and (v) any policies"
"4835","and determinations of the Board of Trustees of the Trust; and"
"4836","            B.   In addition, the Sub-Advisor will:"
"4837","            1.   place orders either directly with the"
"4838","issuer or with any broker or dealer.  Subject to the"
"4839","other provisions of this paragraph, in placing orders"
"4840","with brokers and dealers, the Sub-Advisor will attempt to"
"4841","obtain the best price and the most favorable execution of"
"4842","its orders.  The Advisor has been provided with a copy of"
"4843","the Sub-Advisor's order execution policy and hereby"
"4844","confirms that it has read and understood the information"
"4845","in the order execution policy and agrees to it.  In"
"4846","particular, the Advisor agrees that the Sub-Advisor may"
"4847","trade outside of the regulated market or multilateral"
"4848","trading facility.  In placing orders, the Sub-Advisor"
"4849","will consider the experience and skill of the firm's"
"4850","securities traders as well as the firm's financial"
"4851","responsibility and administrative efficiency.  Consistent"
"4852","with this obligation, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers"
"4853","on the basis of the research, statistical and pricing"
"4854","services they provide to the Fund and other clients of"
"4855","the Advisor or the Sub-Advisor.  Information and research"
"4856","received from such brokers will be in addition to, and"
"4857","not in lieu of, the services required to be performed by"
"4858","the Sub-Advisor hereunder.  A commission paid to such"
"4859","brokers may be higher than that which another qualified"
"4860","broker would have charged for effecting the same"
"4861","transaction, provided that the Sub-Advisor determines in"
"4862","good faith that such commission is reasonable in terms"
"4863","either of the transaction or the overall responsibility"
"4864","of the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor to the Fund and their"
"4865","other clients and that the total commissions paid by the"
"4866","Fund will be reasonable in relation to the benefits to"
"4867","the Fund over the long-term.  Subject to the foregoing"
"4868","and the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Securities"
"4869","Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and other applicable"
"4870","provisions of law, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers and"
"4871","dealers with which it or the Fund is affiliated;"
"4872","            2.   maintain books and records with respect to"
"4873","the Fund's securities transactions and will render to the"
"4874","Advisor and the Trust's Board of Trustees such periodic"
"4875","and special reports as they may request;"
"4876","            3.   maintain a policy and practice of"
"4877","conducting its investment advisory services hereunder"
"4878","independently of the commercial banking operations of its"
"4879","affiliates.  When the Sub-Advisor makes investment"
"4880","recommendations for the Fund, its investment advisory"
"4881","personnel will not inquire or take into consideration"
"4882","whether the issuer of securities proposed for purchase or"
"4883","sale for the Fund's account are customers of the"
"4884","commercial department of its affiliates; and"
"4885","            4.   treat confidentially and as proprietary"
"4886","information of the Fund all records and other information"
"4887","relative to the Fund, and the Fund's prior, current or"
"4888","potential shareholders, and will not use such records and"
"4889","information for any purpose other than performance of its"
"4890","responsibilities and duties hereunder, except after prior"
"4891","notification to and approval in writing by the Fund,"
"4892","which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld and may"
"4893","not be withheld where the Sub-Advisor may be exposed to"
"4894","civil or criminal contempt proceedings for failure to"
"4895","comply, when requested to divulge such information by"
"4896","duly constituted authorities, or when so requested by the"
"4897","Fund."
"4898","            C.   In addition, the Advisor:"
"4899","            1.   agrees that the Sub-Advisor may aggregate"
"4900","transactions for the Fund with transactions for other"
"4901","clients and/ or its own account.  In relation to a"
"4902","particular order, aggregation may operate on some"
"4903","occasions to the advantage of the Advisor and on other"
"4904","occasions to the Advisor's disadvantage.  However, it"
"4905","must be unlikely that the aggregation of orders and"
"4906","transactions will work overall to the disadvantage of the"
"4907","Advisor before transactions will be aggregated;"
"4908","            2.   instructs the Sub-Advisor not to make or"
"4909","book client limit orders (being a specific instruction"
"4910","from the Advisor to buy or sell a financial instrument at"
"4911","a specified price limit or better and for a specified"
"4912","size) in respect of securities admitted to trading on a"
"4913","regulated market which are not immediately executed under"
"4914","prevailing market conditions."
"4915","      IV.   Services Not Exclusive.  Nothing in this Agreement"
"4916","shall prevent the Sub-Advisor or any officer, employee or"
"4917","other affiliate thereof from acting as investment advisor for"
"4918","any other person, firm or corporation, or from engaging in any"
"4919","other lawful activity, and shall not in any way limit or"
"4920","restrict the Sub-Advisor or any of its officers, employees or"
"4921","agents from buying, selling or trading any securities for its"
"4922","or their own accounts or for the accounts of others for whom"
"4923","it or they may be acting; provided, however, that the Sub-"
"4924","Advisor will undertake no activities which, in its judgment,"
"4925","will adversely affect the performance of its obligations under"
"4926","this Agreement."
"4927","      V.   Books and Records.  In compliance with the"
"4928","requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor"
"4929","hereby agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund"
"4930","are the property of the Trust and further agrees to surrender"
"4931","promptly to the Trust any such records upon the Trust's"
"4932","request.  The Sub-Advisor further agrees to preserve for the"
"4933","periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the"
"4934","records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940"
"4935","Act (to the extent such books and records are not maintained"
"4936","by the Advisor)."
"4937","      VI.   Expenses.  During the term of this Agreement, the"
"4938","Sub-Advisor will bear all costs and expenses of its employees"
"4939","and any overhead incurred by the Sub-Advisor in connection"
"4940","with its duties hereunder; provided that the Board of Trustees"
"4941","of the Trust may approve reimbursement to the Sub-Advisor of"
"4942","the pro-rata portion of the salaries, bonuses, health"
"4943","insurance, retirement benefits and all similar employment"
"4944","costs for the time spent on Fund operations (including,"
"4945","without limitation, compliance matters) (other than the"

"4951","      VII.   Compensation."
"4952","            A.   The Advisor agrees to pay to the Sub-Advisor and"
"4953","the Sub-Advisor agrees to accept as full compensation for all"
"4954","services rendered by the Sub-Advisor as such, a monthly fee in"
"4955","arrears at an annual rate equal to the amount set forth in"
"4956","Schedule A hereto.  For any period less than a month during"

"4968","the Fund, Sub-Advisor will bear its share of the amount of"
"4969","such waiver or reimbursement by waiving fees otherwise payable"
"4970","to it hereunder on a proportionate basis to be determined by"
"4971","comparing the aggregate fees that would otherwise be paid to"
"4972","it hereunder with respect to the Fund to the aggregate fees"
"4973","that would otherwise be paid by the Trust to Advisor under the"
"4974","Advisory Agreement with respect to the Fund.  Advisor shall"

"4988","accordance with applicable state law) reasonably incurred by"
"4989","such Indemnitee in connection with the defense or disposition"
"4990","of any action, suit or other proceeding, whether civil or"
"4991","criminal, before any court or administrative or investigative"
"4992","body in which such Indemnitee may be or may have been involved"
"4993","as a party or otherwise or with which such Indemnitee may be"
"4994","or may have been threatened, while acting in any capacity set"
"4995","forth herein or thereafter by reason of such Indemnitee having"
"4996","acted in any such capacity, except with respect to any matter"
"4997","as to which such Indemnitee shall have been adjudicated not to"
"4998","have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that such"
"4999","Indemnitee's action was in the best interest of the Fund and"
"5000","furthermore, in the case of any criminal proceeding, so long"
"5001","as such Indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe that the"
"5002","conduct was unlawful; provided, however, that (1) no"
"5003","Indemnitee shall be indemnified hereunder against any"
"5004","liability to the Fund or its shareholders or any expense of"
"5005","such Indemnitee arising by reason of (i) willful misfeasance,"
"5006","(ii) bad faith, (iii) gross negligence or (iv) reckless"
"5007","disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such"
"5008","Indemnitee's position (the conduct referred to in such clauses"

"5014","provided unless there has been a determination that such"
"5015","settlement or compromise is in the best interests of the Fund"
"5016","and that such Indemnitee appears to have acted in good faith"
"5017","in the reasonable belief that such Indemnitee's action was in"
"5018","the best interest of the Fund and did not involve disabling-"
"5019","conduct by such Indemnitee and (3) with respect to any action,"
"5020","suit or other proceeding voluntarily prosecuted by any"
"5021","Indemnitee as plaintiff, indemnification shall be mandatory"
"5022","only if the prosecution of such action, suit or other"
"5023","proceeding by such Indemnitee was authorized by a majority of"

"5025","            (b)   The Fund shall make advance payments in"
"5026","connection with the expenses of defending any action with"
"5027","respect to which indemnification might be sought hereunder if"
"5028","the Fund receives a written affirmation of the Indemnitee's"
"5029","good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for"
"5030","indemnification has been met and a written undertaking to"
"5031","reimburse the Fund unless it is subsequently determined that"
"5032","such Indemnitee is entitled to such indemnification and if the"
"5033","Trustees of the Trust determine that the facts then known to"
"5034","them would not preclude indemnification.  In addition, at"
"5035","least one of the following conditions must be met:  (A) the"
"5036","Indemnitee shall provide a security for such Indemnitee's"
"5037","undertaking, (B) the Fund shall be insured against losses"
"5038","arising by reason of any unlawful advance, or (C) a majority"
"5039","of a quorum consisting of Trustees of the Trust who are"
"5040","neither interested persons of the Trust (as defined in"
"5041","Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) nor parties to the"
"5042","proceeding (Disinterested Non-Party Trustees) or an"
"5043","independent legal counsel in a written opinion, shall"
"5044","determine, based on a review of readily available facts (as"
"5045","opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that there is reason to"
"5046","believe that the Indemnitee ultimately will be found entitled"
"5047","to indemnification."
"5048","            (c)   All determinations with respect to the standards"
"5049","for indemnification hereunder shall be made (1) by a final"
"5050","decision on the merits by a court or other body before whom"
"5051","the proceeding was brought that such Indemnitee is not liable"
"5052","by reason of disabling conduct, or (2) in the absence of such"
"5053","a decision, by (i) a majority vote of a quorum of the"
"5054","Disinterested Non-Party Trustees of the Trust, or (ii) if such"
"5055","a quorum is not obtainable or even, if obtainable, if a"
"5056","majority vote of such quorum so directs, independent legal"
"5057","counsel in a written opinion.  All determinations that advance"
"5058","payments in connection with the expense of defending any"
"5059","proceeding shall be authorized shall be made in accordance"
"5060","with the immediately preceding clause (2) above."
"5061","      The rights accruing to any Indemnitee under these"
"5062","provisions shall not exclude any other right to which such"
"5063","Indemnitee may be lawfully entitled."
"5064","      IX.   Limitation on Liability."
"5065","            A.   The Sub-Advisor will not be liable for any error"
"5066","of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the"
"5067","Advisor or by the Trust or the Fund in connection with the"
"5068","performance of this Agreement, except a loss resulting from a"
"5069","breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of"
"5070","compensation for services or a loss resulting from willful"
"5071","misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the"
"5072","performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by it of"
"5073","its duties under this Agreement.  As used in this Section"
"5074","9(a), the term Sub-Advisor shall include any affiliates of"
"5075","the Sub-Advisor performing services for the Fund contemplated"
"5076","hereby and partners, directors, officers and employees of the"
"5077","Sub-Advisor and such affiliates."
"5078","            B.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary"
"5079","contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge"
"5080","and agree that, as provided in Article Seventh of the"

"5091","not terminated, this Agreement shall continue in effect with"
"5092","respect to the Fund for successive periods of 12 months,"
"5093","provided such continuance is specifically approved at least"

"5373","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"5374","To the Board of Trustees of BlackRock Funds and Shareholders"
"5375","of BlackRock All-Cap Energy & Resources Portfolio, BlackRock"
"5376","Emerging Markets Dividend Fund (formerly BlackRock China"
"5377","Fund), BlackRock Energy & Resources Portfolio and BlackRock"
"5378","World Gold Fund:"
"5379","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"5380","statements of BlackRock All-Cap Energy & Resources"
"5381","Portfolio, BlackRock Emerging Markets Dividend Fund"
"5382","(formerly BlackRock China Fund), BlackRock Energy &"
"5383","Resources Portfolio and BlackRock World Gold Fund"
"5384","(collectively, the Funds), each a series of BlackRock"
"5385","Funds, as of and for the year ended September 30, 2013, in"
"5386","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"5387","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"5388","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting,"
"5389","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis"
"5390","for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"5391","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"5392","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"5393","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"5394","Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"5395","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"5396","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing"
"5397","and maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"5398","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"5399","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"5400","benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal"
"5401","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"5402","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"5403","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"5404","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"5405","generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal"
"5406","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"5407","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"5408","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"5409","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"5410","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"5411","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"5412","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"5413","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"5414","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"5415","management and directors of the fund; and (3) provide"
"5416","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"5417","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition"
"5418","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"5419","financial statements."
"5420","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"5421","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"5422","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"
"5423","future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"5424","become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that"
"5425","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"5426","deteriorate."
"5427","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"5428","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"5429","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"5430","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"5431","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"5432","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"5433","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"5434","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"5435","fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"5436","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"5437","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"
"5438","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"5439","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"5440","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"5441","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"5442","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we"
"5443","noted no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over"
"5444","financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"5445","for safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"5446","material weakness, as defined above, as of September 30,"
"5447","2013."

"5452","these specified parties."
