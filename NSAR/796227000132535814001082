"462","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"463","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"464","Provident Mutual Funds, Inc."
"465","We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,"
"466","including the schedule of investments, of Provident Mutual Funds Inc.,"
"467","comprising Provident Trust Strategy Fund (the Fund), as"
"468","of September 30, 2014, and the related statement of operations for the"
"469","year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of"
"470","the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights"
"471","for each of the three years in the period then ended.  These financial"
"472","statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the"
"473","Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on"
"474","these financial statements and financial highlights based on our"
"475","audits. The Fund's financial highlights for the years ended on or"
"476","prior to September 30, 2011, were audited by other auditors whose"
"477","report dated October 31, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion."
"478","We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the"
"479","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those"
"480","standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain"
"481","reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and"
"482","financial highlights are free of material misstatement.  An audit"
"483","includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts"
"484","and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our procedures included"
"485","confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2014, by"
"486","correspondence with the custodian.  An audit also includes assessing"
"487","the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by"
"488","management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement"
"489","presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis"
"490","for our opinion."
"491","In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights"
"492","referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the"
"493","financial position of Provident Trust Strategy Fund as of September"
"494","30, 2014, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the"
"495","changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then"
"496","ended, and the financial highlights for each of the three years in the"
"497","period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally"
"498","accepted in the United States of America."
