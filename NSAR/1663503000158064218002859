"779","To the Shareholders of"
"780","Centerstone Investors"
"781","Fund and Centerstone"
"782","International Fund"
"783","and Board of Trustees"
"784","of Centerstone"
"785","Investors Trust"
"786","In planning and"
"787","performing our audit of"

"789","statements of"
"790","Centerstone Investors"
"791","Trust, comprising"
"792","Centerstone Investors"
"793","Fund and Centerstone"
"794","International Fund (the"
"795","Funds) as of and for"
"796","the year ended March"
"797","31, 2018, in accordance"
"798","with the standards of"
"799","the Public Company"
"800","Accounting Oversight"
"801","Board (United States),"
"802","we considered the"
"803","Funds internal control"
"804","over financial reporting,"
"805","including controls over"
"806","safeguarding securities,"
"807","as a basis for designing"
"808","our auditing procedures"
"809","for the purpose of"
"810","expressing our opinion"
"811","on the financial"
"812","statements and to"
"813","comply with the"
"814","requirements of Form"
"815","N-SAR, but not for the"
"816","purpose of expressing"
"817","an opinion on the"
"818","effectiveness of the"
"819","Funds internal control"
"820","over financial reporting."
"821","Accordingly, we express"
"822","no such opinion."
"823","The management of the"
"824","Funds is responsible for"
"825","establishing and"
"826","maintaining effective"
"827","internal control over"
"828","financial reporting.  In"
"829","fulfilling this"
"830","responsibility,"
"831","estimates and"
"832","judgments by"
"833","management are"
"834","required to assess the"
"835","expected benefits and"
"836","related costs of"
"837","controls.  A funds"
"838","internal control over"
"839","financial reporting is a"
"840","process designed to"
"841","provide reasonable"
"842","assurance regarding the"
"843","reliability of financial"
"844","reporting and the"
"845","preparation of financial"
"846","statements for external"
"847","purposes in accordance"
"848","with generally accepted"
"849","accounting principles"
"850","(GAAP).  A funds"
"851","internal control over"
"852","financial reporting"
"853","includes those policies"
"854","and procedures that (1)"
"855","pertain to the"
"856","maintenance of records"
"857","that, in reasonable"
"858","detail, accurately and"
"859","fairly reflect the"
"860","transactions and"
"861","dispositions of the"
"862","assets of the fund; (2)"
"863","provide reasonable"
"864","assurance that"
"865","transactions are"
"866","recorded as necessary"
"867","to permit preparation"
"868","of financial statements"
"869","in accordance with"
"870","GAAP, and that receipts"
"871","and expenditures of the"
"872","fund are being made"
"873","only in accordance with"
"874","authorizations of"
"875","management and"
"876","trustees of the fund;"
"877","and (3) provide"
"878","reasonable assurance"
"879","regarding prevention or"
"880","timely detection of"
"881","unauthorized"
"882","acquisition, use or"
"883","disposition of a funds"
"884","assets that could have a"
"885","material effect on the"
"886","financial statements."
"887","Because of its inherent"
"888","limitations, internal"
"889","control over financial"
"890","reporting may not"
"891","prevent or detect"
"892","misstatements.  Also,"
"893","projections of any"
"894","evaluation of"
"895","effectiveness to future"
"896","periods are subject to"
"897","the risk that controls"
"898","may become"
"899","inadequate because of"
"900","changes in conditions,"
"901","or that the degree of"
"902","compliance with the"
"903","policies or procedures"
"904","may deteriorate."
"905","A deficiency in internal"
"906","control over financial"
"907","reporting exists when"
"908","the design or operation"
"909","of a control does not"
"910","allow management or"
"911","employees, in the"
"912","normal course of"
"913","performing their"
"914","assigned functions, to"
"915","prevent or detect"
"916","misstatements on a"
"917","timely basis.  A material"
"918","weakness is a"
"919","deficiency, or"
"920","combination of"
"921","deficiencies, in internal"
"922","control over financial"
"923","reporting, such that"
"924","there is a reasonable"
"925","possibility that a"
"926","material misstatement"
"927","of the Funds annual or"
"928","interim financial"
"929","statements will not be"
"930","prevented or detected"
"931","on a timely basis."
"932","Our consideration of"
"933","the Funds internal"
"934","control over financial"
"935","reporting was for the"
"936","limited purpose"
"937","described in the first"
"938","paragraph and would"
"939","not necessarily disclose"
"940","all deficiencies in"
"941","internal control that"
"942","might be material"
"943","weaknesses under"
"944","standards established"
"945","by the Public Company"
"946","Accounting Oversight"
"947","Board (United States)."
"948","However, we noted no"
"949","deficiencies in the"
"950","Funds internal control"
"951","over financial reporting"
"952","and its operation,"
"953","including controls over"
"954","safeguarding securities,"
"955","that we consider to be"
"956","a material weakness as"
"957","defined above as of"
"958","March 31, 2018."
"959","This report is intended"
"960","solely for the"
"961","information and use of"
"962","management and the"
