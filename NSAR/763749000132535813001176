"781","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"782","To the Board of Trustees of Voyageur Mutual Funds III Trust and the Shareholders of"
"783","Delaware Select Growth Fund"
"784","Delaware Large Cap Core Fund"
"785","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Delaware Select Growth Fund and"
"786","Delaware Large Cap Core Fund (constituting Voyageur Mutual Funds III Trust, hereafter referred to as"
"787","the Trust) as of and for the year ended April 30, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"788","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust's internal control over"
"789","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"790","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"791","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"792","Trust's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"793","effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"794","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"795","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"796","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal control over"
"797","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"798","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"799","generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"800","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"801","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"802","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"803","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"804","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management"
"805","and trustees of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"806","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a"
"807","material effect on the financial statements."
"808","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"809","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"810","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"811","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"812","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control"
"813","does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"814","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"815","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"816","possibility that a material misstatement of the Trust's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"817","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"818","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"819","described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"820","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"821","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust's"
"822","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"823","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of April 30, 2012."
"824","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"825","Delaware Select Growth Fund and Delaware Large Cap Core Fund and the Securities and Exchange"
"826","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"827","parties."

"876","       INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT"
"877","       AGREEMENT, made by and between VOYAGEUR MUTUAL FUNDS III, a"
"878","Delaware statutory trust (the Trust), on behalf of each series of shares of beneficial"
"879","interest of the Trust that is listed on Exhibit A to this Agreement, as that Exhibit may be"
"880","amended from time to time (each such series of shares is hereinafter referred to as a Fund"
"881","and, together with other series of shares listed on such Exhibit, the Funds), and"
"882","DELAWARE MANAGEMENT COMPANY, a series of Delaware Management Business"
"883","Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (the Investment Manager)."
"884","WITNESSETH:"
"885","       WHEREAS, the Trust has been organized and operates as an investment company"
"886","registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act);"
"887","       WHEREAS, each Fund engages in the business of investing and reinvesting its"
"888","assets in securities;"
"889","       WHEREAS, the Investment Manager is registered under the Investment Advisers"
"890","Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act), as an investment adviser and engages in the"
"891","business of providing investment management services; and"
"892","       WHEREAS, the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and the Investment Manager desire"
"893","to enter into this Agreement so that the Investment Manager may provide investment"
"894","management services to each Fund."
"895","       NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained,"
"896","and each of the parties hereto intending to be legally bound, it is agreed as follows:"
"897","          1. 	The Trust hereby employs the Investment Manager to manage the"
"898","investment and reinvestment of each Fund's assets and to administer its affairs, subject to"
"899","the direction of the Trust's Board of Trustees and officers for the period and on the terms"
"900","hereinafter set forth.  The Investment Manager hereby accepts such employment and agrees"
"901","during such period to render the services and assume the obligations herein set forth for the"
"902","compensation herein provided.  The Investment Manager shall for all purposes herein be"
"903","deemed to be an independent contractor, and shall, unless otherwise expressly provided and"
"904","authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the Trust or the Funds in any way, or in"
"905","any way be deemed an agent of the Trust or the Funds.   The Investment Manager shall"
"906","regularly make decisions as to what securities and other instruments to purchase and sell on"
"907","behalf of each Fund and shall effect the purchase and sale of such investments in"
"908","furtherance of each Fund's investment objectives and policies and shall furnish the Board"
"909","of Trustees of the Trust with such information and reports regarding each Fund's"
"910","investments as the Investment Manager deems appropriate or as the Trustees of the Trust"
"911","may reasonably request.  Such decisions and services shall include exercising discretion"
"912","regarding any voting rights, rights to consent to corporate actions and any other rights"
"913","pertaining to each Fund's investment securities."
"914","          2. 	The Trust shall conduct its own business and affairs and shall bear the"
"915","expenses and salaries necessary and incidental thereto, including, but not in limitation of the"
"916","foregoing, the costs incurred in:  the maintenance of its corporate existence; the"
"917","maintenance of its own books, records and procedures; dealing with its own shareholders;"
"918","the payment of dividends; transfer of shares, including issuance, redemption and"
"919","repurchase of shares; preparation of share certificates; reports and notices to shareholders;"
"920","calling and holding of shareholders' and trustees' meetings; miscellaneous office expenses;"
"921","brokerage commissions; custodian fees; legal, auditing, fund accounting, and financial"
"922","administration fees; taxes; federal and state registration fees; and other costs and expenses"
"923","approved by the Board of Trustees.  Trustees, officers and employees of the Investment"
"924","Manager may be directors, trustees, officers and employees of any of the investment"
"925","companies within the Delaware Investments family of funds (including the Trust)."
"926","Trustees, officers and employees of the Investment Manager who are directors, trustees,"
"927","officers and/or employees of these investment companies shall not receive any"
"928","compensation from such companies for acting in such dual capacity."
"929","       In the conduct of the respective businesses of the parties hereto and in the"
"930","performance of this Agreement, the Trust and Investment Manager may share facilities"
"931","common to each, which may include legal and accounting personnel, with appropriate"
"932","proration of expenses between them."
"933","	3.	 (a) 	Subject to the primary objective of obtaining the best execution, the"
"934","Investment Manager may place orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities and"
"935","other instruments with such broker/dealers selected by the Investment Manager who provide"
"936","statistical, factual and financial information and services to the Trust, to the Investment"
"937","Manager, to any sub-adviser (as defined in Paragraph 5 hereof, a Sub-Adviser) or to any"
"938","other fund or account for which the Investment Manager or any Sub-Adviser provides"
"939","investment advisory services and/or with broker/dealers who sell shares of the Trust or who"
"940","sell shares of any other investment company (or series thereof) for which the Investment"
"941","Manager or any Sub-Adviser provides investment advisory services.  Broker/dealers who"
"942","sell shares of any investment companies or series thereof for which the Investment Manager"
"943","or Sub-Adviser provides investment advisory services shall only receive orders for the"
"944","purchase or sale of portfolio securities to the extent that the placing of such orders is in"
"945","compliance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and"
"946","Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and does not take into account"
"947","such broker/dealer's promotion or sale of such shares."
"948","		(b) 	Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) above and"
"949","subject to such policies and procedures as may be adopted by the Board of Trustees and"
"950","officers of the Trust, the Investment Manager may cause a Fund to pay a member of an"
"951","exchange, broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction"
"952","in excess of the amount of commission another member of an exchange, broker or dealer"
"953","would have charged for effecting that transaction, in such instances where the Investment"
"954","Manager has determined in good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in"
"955","relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such member,"
"956","broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the Investment"
"957","Manager's overall responsibilities with respect to the Trust and to other investment"
"958","companies (or series thereof) and other advisory accounts for which the Investment"
"959","Manager exercises investment discretion."
"960","	4. 	As compensation for the investment services to be rendered to a particular"
"961","Fund by the Investment Manager under the provisions of this Agreement, the Trust shall"
"962","pay monthly to the Investment Manager exclusively from that Fund's assets, a fee based on"
"963","the average daily net assets of that Fund during the month.  Such fee shall be calculated in"
"964","accordance with the fee schedule applicable to that Fund as set forth in Exhibit A hereto."
"965","       If this Agreement is terminated prior to the end of any calendar month with respect"
"966","to a particular Fund, the management fee for such Fund shall be prorated for the portion of"
"967","any month in which this Agreement is in effect with respect to such Fund according to the"
"968","proportion which the number of calendar days during which the Agreement is in effect"
"969","bears to the number of calendar days in the month, and shall be payable within 10 calendar"
"970","days after the date of termination."
"971","       5. 	The Investment Manager may, at its expense, select and contract with one or"
"972","more investment advisers registered under the Advisers Act (Sub-Advisers) to perform"
"973","some or all of the services for a Fund for which it is responsible under this Agreement.  The"
"974","Investment Manager will compensate any Sub-Adviser for its services to the Fund.  The"
"975","Investment Manager may terminate the services of any Sub-Adviser at any time in its sole"
"976","discretion, and shall at such time assume the responsibilities of such Sub-Adviser unless"
"977","and until a successor Sub-Adviser is selected and the requisite approval of the Fund's"
"978","shareholders, if required, is obtained.  The Investment Manager will continue to have"
"979","responsibility for all advisory services furnished by any Sub-Adviser."
"980","       6. 	The services to be rendered by the Investment Manager to the Trust under"
"981","the provisions of this Agreement are not to be deemed to be exclusive.  The Investment"
"982","Manager, its trustees, officers, employees, agents and shareholders may engage in other"
"983","businesses, may render investment advisory services to other investment companies, or to"
"984","any other corporation, association, firm or individual, and may render underwriting services"
"985","to the Trust or to any other investment company, corporation, association, firm or"
"986","individual, so long as the Investment Manager's other activities do not impair its ability to"
"987","render the services provided for in this Agreement."
"988","       7. 	It is understood and agreed that so long as the Investment Manager and/or its"
"989","advisory affiliates shall continue to serve as the Trust's investment adviser, other"
"990","investment companies as may be sponsored or advised by the Investment Manager or its"
"991","affiliates may have the right permanently to adopt and to use the words Delaware,"
"992","Delaware Investments or Delaware Group in their names and in the names of any series"
"993","or class of shares of such funds."
"994","	8. 	In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or a"
"995","reckless disregard of the performance of its duties as the Investment Manager to the Trust,"
"996","the Investment Manager shall not be subject to liability to the Trust or to any shareholder of"
"997","the Trust for any action or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services"
"998","hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any"
"999","security, or otherwise."
"1000","	9. 	(a)	This Agreement shall be executed and become effective as of the"
"1001","date written below, and shall become effective with respect to a particular Fund as of the"
"1002","effective date set forth in Exhibit A for that Fund, only if approved by the vote of a"
"1003","majority of the outstanding voting securities of that Fund.  It shall continue in effect for an"
"1004","initial period of two years for each Fund and may be renewed thereafter only so long as"
"1005","such renewal and continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the Board of"
"1006","Trustees or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of that Fund and"
"1007","only if the terms and the renewal hereof have been approved by the vote of a majority of"
"1008","the Trustees of the Trust who are not parties hereto or interested persons of any such party"
"1009","(Independent Trustees), cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on"
"1010","such approval."
"1011","             (b)	This Agreement (and Exhibit A hereto) may be amended without the"
"1012","approval of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund if the amendment"
"1013","relates solely to a management fee reduction or other change that is permitted or not"
"1014","prohibited under then current federal law, rule, regulation or SEC staff interpretation thereof"
"1015","to be made without shareholder approval.  This Agreement may be amended from time to"
"1016","time pursuant to a written agreement executed by the Trust, on behalf of the applicable"
"1017","Fund, and the Investment Manager."
"1018","             (c)	This Agreement may be terminated as to any Fund by the Trust at"
"1019","any time, without the payment of a penalty, on sixty days' written notice to the Investment"
"1020","Manager of the Trust's intention to do so, pursuant to action by the Board of Trustees of the"
"1021","Trust or pursuant to the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the"
"1022","affected Fund.  The Investment Manager may terminate this Agreement at any time, without"
"1023","the payment of a penalty, on sixty days' written notice to the Trust of its intention to do so."
"1024","Upon termination of this Agreement, the obligations of all the parties hereunder shall cease"
"1025","and terminate as of the date of such termination, except for any obligation to respond for a"
"1026","breach of this Agreement committed prior to such termination, and except for the obligation"
"1027","of the Trust to pay to the Investment Manager the fee provided in Paragraph 4 hereof,"
"1028","prorated to the date of termination.  This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the"
"1029","event of its assignment."
"1030","	10. 	This Agreement shall extend to and bind the administrators, successors and"
"1031","permitted assigns of the parties hereto."
"1032","	11. 	For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) the terms vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities; interested persons; and assignment shall have the"
"1033","meaning ascribed to them in the 1940 Act, and (ii) references to the SEC and FINRA shall"
"1034","be deemed to include any successor regulators."
"1035","	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be"
"1036","signed by their duly authorized officers as of the 4th day of January, 2010."
