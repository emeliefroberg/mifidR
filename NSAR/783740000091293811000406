"3704","the proper  supervision of its assets."

"3712","2004, and By-Laws,  each as amended"

"3720"," securities  in  accordance  with the"
"3721","Advisers  policies  and  procedures  as  presented  to the  Trustees  of the"
"3722"," Trust  from time to time.  Should the"

"3725","thereof in writing,  the Adviser shall be bound by such  determination  for"
"3726","the period,  if any,  specified in such"
"3727","notice or until similarly notified that such determination shall be revoked."
"3728","         (b) The Adviser shall take, on behalf of the Fund,  all actions"
"3729","which it deems  necessary to implement the"
"3730","investment  policies  determined as provided above,  and in particular to plac"
"3731"," all orders for the purchase or sale"
"3732","of portfolio  securities or other  instruments  for the Funds account with"
"3733","brokers or dealers  selected by it, and"
"3734","to that end, the Adviser is authorized as the agent of the Fund to give"
"3735"," instructions  to the Custodian of the Fund"
"3736","as to the  deliveries  of  securities  or other  instruments  and payments"
"3737"," of cash for the account of the Fund.  In"
"3738","connection  with the  selection of such brokers or dealers and the placing of"
"3739"," such orders,  the Adviser is directed"
"3740","to seek for the Fund the best overall  price and execution  available  from"
"3741","responsible  brokerage  firms,  taking"
"3742","account of all factors it deems relevant,  including by way of  illustration:"
"3743"," price;  the size of the transaction;"
"3744","the nature of the market for the security;  the amount of the commission;"
"3745","the timing and impact of the transaction"
"3746","taking into account market prices and trends; the reputation,  experience"
"3747"," and financial  stability of the broker or"
"3748","dealer  involved;  and the  quality  of  services  rendered  by the  broker"
"3749","or dealer  in other  transactions.  In"
"3750","fulfilling  this  requirement,  the Adviser  shall not be deemed to have acted"
"3751"," unlawfully  or to have breached any"

"3755","in excess of the amount of  commission"
"3756","another  broker or dealer would have charged for  effecting  that  transaction,"
"3757","  if the Adviser  determined in good"
"3758","faith that such  amount of  commission  was  reasonable  in  relation to the"
"3759","value of the  brokerage  and  research"
"3760","services  provided  by such  broker or  dealer,  viewed  in terms of  either"
"3761"," that  particular  transaction  or the"
"3762","Advisers  overall  responsibilities  with respect to the Fund and to other"
"3763","clients of the Adviser as to which the"
"3764","Adviser exercises  investment  discretion.  Subject to seeking the best price"
"3765","and execution as described above, and"
"3766","in accordance with  applicable  rules and  regulations,  the Adviser also is"
"3767","authorized to consider sales of shares"
"3768","of the Fund or of other funds or accounts of the Adviser as a factor in the"
"3769"," selection of brokers and dealers."
"3770","         (c) The Adviser may from time to time enter into  sub-investment"
"3771"," advisory  agreements with respect to the"

"3773"," the Adviser may  determine,  provided"

"3779","be liable for any error of judgment or"
"3780","mistake of law by any  sub-adviser  or for any loss arising out of any"
"3781","investment  made by any  sub-adviser or for"
"3782","any act or omission in the execution and management of the Fund by any"
"3783","sub-adviser."

"4097","REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"4098","To the Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust X:"
"4099","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of MFS"
"4100","Absolute Return Fund and MFS International Diversification"
"4101","Fund (the Funds) (each a portfolio comprising MFS Series Trust X) as of and"
"4102","for the year ended May 31, 2011, in accordance with the"
"4103","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"4104","we considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"4105","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"4106","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"4107","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"4108","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"4109","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"4110","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"4111","opinion."
"4112","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"4113","effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"4114","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"4115","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs"
"4116","of controls. A funds internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"4117","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"4118","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"4119","for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"4120","accepted accounting principles. A funds internal control over financial"
"4121","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)"
"4122","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"4123","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"4124","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"4125","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"4126","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"4127","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are"
"4128","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"4129","of the trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"4130","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"4131"," disposition of a funds assets that could have a"
"4132","material effect on the financial statements."
"4133","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"4134"," may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"4135","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject"
"4136","to the risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"4137","of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"4138"," procedures may deteriorate."
"4139","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"4140","design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"4141","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"4142","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"4143","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in"
"4144","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is"
"4145","a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the funds annual or"
"4146","interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"4147","detected on a timely basis."
"4148","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting was"
"4149","for the limited purpose described in the first"
"4150","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"4151","control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"4152","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"4153"," However, we noted no deficiencies in the Funds"
"4154","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"4155"," for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a"
"4156","material weakness, as defined above, as of May 31, 2011."

"4203","principles.  A companys internal control over financial  reporting includes"
"4204"," those policies and procedures that (1)"
"4205","pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately"
"4206"," and fairly reflect the  transactions"
"4207","and dispositions of the assets of the company;  (2) provide reasonable"
"4208","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"4209","necessary  to permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance"
"4210"," with  generally  accepted  accounting"
"4211","principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are"
"4212","being  made  only  in  accordance  with"
"4213","authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of the  company;  and (3)"
"4214"," provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding"
"4215","prevention or timely  detection of unauthorized  acquisition,  use or"
"4216","disposition of a company"
"4217","s  assets that could"
"4218","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"4219","Because  of its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial"
"4220"," reporting  may not  prevent  or detect"
"4221","misstatements.  Also,  projections  of any  evaluation of  effectiveness"
"4222"," to future periods are subject to the risk"
"4223","that controls may become  inadequate  because of changes in conditions,  or"
"4224","that the degree of compliance  with the"
"4225","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"4226","A deficiency in internal  control over  financial  reporting  exists when the"
"4227","design or operation of a control does"
"4228","not allow  management or employees,  in the normal course of performing  their"
"4229"," assigned  functions,  to prevent or"
"4230","detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"4231","or a combination of deficiencies,  in"
"4232","internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  such  that  there  is a"
"4233"," reasonable  possibility  that  a  material"
"4234","misstatement  of the  companys  annual or interim  financial  statements"
"4235"," will not be  prevented  or detected on a"
"4236","timely basis."
"4237","Our  consideration  of the Funds internal control over financial  reporting"
"4238","was for the limited purpose  described"
"4239","in the first  paragraph  and would not  necessarily  disclose all  deficiencies"
"4240","  in internal  control that might be"
"4241","material weaknesses under standards  established by the Public Company"
"4242","Accounting  Oversight Board (United States)."
"4243","However,  we noted no  deficiencies  in the Funds  internal  control over"
"4244","financial  reporting and its operation,"
"4245","including  controls over safeguarding  securities that we consider to be a"
"4246"," material weakness as defined above as of"
