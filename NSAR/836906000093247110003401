"1106","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"1107","Accounting Firm"
"1108","To the Board of Trustees of Vanguard Malvern"
"1109","Funds and the Shareholders of"
"1110","Vanguard Asset Allocation Fund"
"1111","Vanguard Capital Value Fund and"
"1112","Vanguard U.S. Value Fund"
"1113","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"1114","financial statements of Vanguard Asset Allocation"
"1115","Fund, Vanguard Capital Value Fund and Vanguard"
"1116","U.S. Value Fund (constituting Vanguard Malvern"
"1117","Funds, hereafter referred to as the ?Trust?) as of and"
"1118","for the year ended September 30, 2010, in"
"1119","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"1120","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"1121","States), we considered the Trust?s internal control"
"1122","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1123","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1124","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"1125","our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1126","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"1127","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1128","effectiveness of the Trust?s internal control over"
"1129","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express"
"1130","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's"
"1131","internal control over financial reporting."
"1132","The management of the Trust is responsible for"
"1133","establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"1134","control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"1135","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1136","management are required to assess the expected"
"1137","benefits and related costs of controls.  A"
"1138","company?s internal control over financial reporting is"
"1139","a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1140","assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1141","reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1142","for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1143","accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"1144","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1145","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1146","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"1147","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"1148","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)"
"1149","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1150","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"1151","financial statements in accordance with generally"
"1152","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts"
"1153","and expenditures of the company are being made"
"1154","only in accordance with authorizations of"
"1155","management and trustees of the company; and (3)"
"1156","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"1157","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"1158","or disposition of a company?s assets that could"
"1159","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"1160","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"1161","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"1162","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"1163","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"1164","risk that controls may become inadequate because"
"1165","of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1166","compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1167","deteriorate."
"1168","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1169","reporting exists when the design or operation of a"
"1170","control does not allow management or employees,"
"1171","in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1172","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"1173","timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or"
"1174","a combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"1175","over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1176","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"1177","of the Trust's annual or interim financial statements"
"1178","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1179","Our consideration of the Trust?s internal control over"
"1180","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1181","described in the first paragraph and would not"
"1182","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal"
"1183","control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1184","weaknesses under standards established by the"
"1185","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1186","(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies"
"1187","in the Trust?s internal control over financial reporting"
"1188","and its operation, including controls over"
"1189","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be"
"1190","material weaknesses as defined above as of"
"1191","September 30, 2010."
"1192","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"1193","use of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"1194","Vanguard Malvern Funds and the Securities and"
"1195","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be"
"1196","and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"1197","specified parties."

"1217","?1940 Act?); and"
"1218","	WHEREAS, the Trust offers a series of shares known as VANGUARD ASSET"
"1219","ALLOCATION FUND (the ?Fund?); and"
"1220","WHEREAS, the Trust retained the Advisor to render investment advisory services"
"1221","to the Fund under an Investment Advisory Agreement, dated as of July 1, 1997,"
"1222","which was amended on July 1, 2006 (collectively, the ?Prior Agreement?); and"
"1223","	WHEREAS, the Trust desires to amend and restate the Prior Agreement in"
"1224","its entirety, and the Advisor is willing to render investment advisory"
"1225","services to the Fund in accordance with the Agreement."
"1226","	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and undertakings"
"1227","set forth in this Agreement, the Trust and the Advisor hereby agree as"
"1228","follows:"
"1229","WITNESSETH:"
"1230","1.	Appointment of Advisor.	The Trust hereby employs the Advisor as"
"1231","investment advisor, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, for the"
"1232","portion of the assets of the Fund that the Trust?s Board of Trustees (the"
"1233","?Board of Trustees?) determines in its sole discretion to assign to the"
"1234","Advisor from time to time (referred to in this Agreement as the ?Mellon"
"1235","Capital Portfolio?), as communicated to the Advisor on behalf of the Board of"
"1236","Trustees by The Vanguard Group, Inc. (?Vanguard?), including cash that may be"
"1237","directed to Vanguard for cash management purposes. The Board of Trustees may,"
"1238","from time to time, make additions to, and withdrawals from, the assets of the"
"1239","Fund assigned to the Advisor.  The Advisor accepts such appointment and agrees"
"1240","to render the services herein set forth, for the compensation herein provided."
"1241","2.	Duties of Advisor. The Trust employs the Advisor to manage the"
"1242","investment and reinvestment of the assets of the Mellon Capital Portfolio; to"
"1243","continuously review, supervise, and administer an investment program for the"
"1244","Mellon Capital Portfolio; to determine in its discretion the securities to be"
"1245","purchased or sold and the portion of such assets to be held uninvested; to"
"1246","provide the Fund with all records concerning the activities of the Advisor"
"1247","that the Fund is required to maintain; and to render regular reports to the"
"1248","Trust?s officers and Board of Trustees concerning the discharge of the"
"1249","foregoing responsibilities. The Advisor will discharge the foregoing"
"1250","responsibilities subject to the supervision and oversight of the Trust?s"
"1251","officers and the Board of Trustees, and in compliance with the objectives,"
"1252","policies and limitations set forth in the Fund?s prospectus and Statement of"
"1253","Additional Information, any additional operating policies or procedures that"
"1254","the Fund communicates to the Advisor in writing, and applicable laws and"
"1255","regulations. The Advisor agrees to provide, at its own expense, the office"
"1256","space, furnishings and equipment, and personnel required by it to perform the"
"1257","services on the terms and for the compensation provided herein."
"1258","3.	Securities Transactions. The Advisor is authorized to select the brokers"
"1259","or dealers that will execute purchases and sales of securities for the Mellon"
"1260","Capital Portfolio, and is directed to use its best efforts to obtain best"
"1261","execution for such transactions.  In selecting brokers or dealers to execute"
"1262","trades for the Mellon Capital Portfolio, the Advisor will comply with all"
"1263","applicable statutes, rules, interpretations by the U.S. Securities and"
"1264","Exchange Commission or its staff, other applicable law, and the written"
"1265","policies established by the Board of Trustees and communicated to the Advisor"
"1266","in writing."
"1267","4.	Compensation of Advisor. For services to be provided by the Advisor"
"1268","pursuant to this Agreement, the Fund will pay to the Advisor, and the Advisor"
"1269","agrees to accept as full compensation therefor, an investment advisory fee"
"1270","consisting of a base fee plus a performance adjustment at the rates specified"
"1271","in Schedule A to this Agreement, payable quarterly in arrears."
"1272","5.	Reports. The Fund and the Advisor agree to furnish to each other current"
"1273","prospectuses, proxy statements, reports to shareholders, certified copies of"
"1274","their financial statements (or, in the case of the Advisor, the financial"
"1275","statements of its parent company, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation),"
"1276","and such other information with regard to their affairs as each may reasonably"
"1277","request including but not limited to, information about changes in the"
"1278","investment officers of the Advisor who are responsible for managing the Mellon"
"1279","Capital Portfolio."
"1280","6.	Compliance. The Advisor agrees to comply with all Applicable Law and all"
"1281","policies, procedures, or reporting requirements that the Board of Trustees"
"1282","reasonably adopts and communicates to the Advisor in writing (subject to the"
"1283","Advisor?s review and timely implementation), including, without limitation,"
"1284","any such policies, procedures, or reporting requirements relating to soft"
"1285","dollar or other brokerage arrangements.  ?Applicable Law? means (i) the"
"1286","?federal securities laws? as defined in Rule 38a-1(e)(1) under the 1940 Act,"
"1287","as they relate to the services provided by the Advisor to the Trust pursuant"
"1288","to this Agreement, and (ii) any and all other laws, rules, and regulations,"
"1289","whether foreign or domestic, in each case applicable at any time and from time"
"1290","to time to the investment management operations of the Advisor in relation to"
"1291","the Mellon Capital Portfolio."
"1292","7.	Status of Advisor. The services of the Advisor to the Fund are not to be"
"1293","deemed exclusive, and the Advisor will be free to render similar services to"
"1294","others so long as its services to the Fund are not impaired thereby. The"
"1295","Advisor will be deemed to be an independent contractor and will, unless"
"1296","otherwise expressly provided or authorized, have no authority to act for or"
"1297","represent the Fund in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or"
"1298","the Trust."
"1299","8.	 Liability of Advisor. In the absence of (i) misfeasance, negligence, or"
"1300","the violation of applicable law, on the part of the Advisor in performance of"
"1301","its obligations and duties hereunder, (ii) reckless disregard by the Advisor"
"1302","of its obligations and duties hereunder, or (iii) a loss resulting from a"
"1303","breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for"
"1304","services (in which case any award of damages shall be limited to the period"
"1305","and the amount set forth in Section 36(b)(3) of the 1940 Act), the Advisor"
"1306","shall not be subject to any liability to the Fund, or to any shareholder of"
"1307","the Fund, for any error of judgment, mistake of law or any other act or"
"1308","omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services hereunder"
"1309","including, without limitation, for any losses that may be sustained in"
"1310","connection with the purchase, holding, redemption or sale of any security on"
"1311","behalf of the Fund.  Federal and state securities laws and ERISA impose"
"1312","liabilities under certain circumstances on persons who act in good faith, and"
"1313","therefore nothing herein shall in any way constitute a waiver or limitation of"
"1314","any rights which the Fund may have under such laws."
"1315","9.	Limitations on Consultations.  The Advisor is prohibited from consulting"
"1316","with other advisors of the Fund, except Vanguard, concerning transactions for"
"1317","the Fund in securities or other assets."
"1318","10.	Duration; Termination; Notices; Amendment. This Agreement will become"
"1319","effective on the date hereof and shall continue in effect for successive"
"1320","twelve-month periods, only so long as each such continuance specifically is"
"1321","approved at least annually by the Board of Trustees, including a majority of"
"1322","those Trustees who are not parties to such Agreement or interested persons of"
"1323","any such party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting"
"1324","on such approval. In addition, the question of continuance of the Agreement"
"1325","may be presented to the shareholders of the Fund; in such event, such"
"1326","continuance will be effected only if approved by the affirmative vote of a"
"1327","majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund."
"1328","Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, (i) this Agreement may at any time be"
"1329","terminated without payment of any penalty either by vote of the Board of"
"1330","Trustees or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the"
"1331","Fund, on sixty days? written notice to the Advisor, (ii) this Agreement will"
"1332","automatically terminate in the event of its assignment, and (iii) this"
"1333","Agreement may be terminated by the Advisor on ninety days? written notice to"
"1334","the Fund. Any notice under this Agreement will be given in writing, addressed"
"1335","and delivered, or mailed postpaid, to the other party as follows:"
