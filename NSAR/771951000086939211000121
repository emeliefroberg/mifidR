"828","Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund:"
"829","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"830","statements of Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund (the Fund) as of"
"831","and for the year ended July 31, 2011, in accordance with the"
"832","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"833","(United States), we considered the Funds internal control over"
"834","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"835","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"836","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"837","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"838","but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"839","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial"

"842","reporting."
"843","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"844","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"845","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"846","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"847","benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds internal"
"848","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"849","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"850","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"851","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"852","accepted accounting principles.  A funds internal control over"
"853","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"854","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"855","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"856","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"857","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"

"863","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"864","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a funds"

"866","statements."
"867","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"

"869","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"870","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"871","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"

"873","deteriorate."
"874","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"875","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"876","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"877","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"878","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"

"884","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
