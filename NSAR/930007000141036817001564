"5461","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"5462","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of PACE Select"
"5463","Advisors Trust"
"5464","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"5465","statements of PACE Select Advisors Trust (comprising,"
"5466","respectively, PACE Alternative Strategies Investments, PACE"

"5480","year ended July 31, 2017, in accordance with the standards of"
"5481","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"5482","States), we considered the Company's internal control over"
"5483","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"5484","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"5485","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"5486","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"5487","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"5488","effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial"
"5489","reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"5490","The management of the Company is responsible for"
"5491","establishing and maintaining effective internal control over"
"5492","financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates"
"5493","and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"5494","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's"
"5495","internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"5496","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"5497","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"5498","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"5499","accounting principles. A company's internal control over"
"5500","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"5501","(1) pertain to the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"5502","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"5503","dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"5504","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"5505","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"5506","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"5507","expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance"
"5508","with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"5509","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"5510","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"5511","or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material"
"5512","effect on the financial statements."
"5513","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"5514","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"5515","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"5516","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"5517","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"5518","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"5519","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"5520","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"5521","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"5522","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"5523","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"5524","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"5525","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"5526","material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim"
"5527","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"5528","timely basis."
"5529","Our consideration of the Company's internal control over"
"5530","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the"
"5531","first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"5532","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"5533","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"5534","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we"
"5535","noted no deficiencies in the Company's internal control over"
"5536","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"5537","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material"
"5538","weakness as defined above as of July 31, 2017."

"5639","Delaware corporation, and Kettle Hill Capital Management,"
"5640","LLC (Sub- Adviser), a Delaware limited liability company"
"5641","(the Agreement)."
"5642","RECITALS"
"5643","(1)	UBS AM has entered into a Management Agreement"
"5644","dated as of August 1, 2008  (Management Agreement),"
"5645","with PACE(r) Select Advisors Trust (Trust), an open-end"
"5646","management investment company registered under the"
"5647","Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act),"
"5648","with respect to PACE(r)  Alternative Strategies Investments"
"5649","(Portfolio); and"
"5650","(2) 	UBS AM is authorized to retain one or more sub-"
"5651","advisers to furnish certain investment advisory services to"
"5652","UBS AM and the Portfolio;"
"5653","(3)	UBS AM desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to furnish"
"5654","certain investment advisory services to UBS AM and the"
"5655","Portfolio or a designated portion of the assets (Segment)"
"5656","of the Portfolio; and"
"5657","(4)	The Sub-Adviser is willing to furnish such services;"
"5658","Now therefore, in consideration of the premises and"
"5659","mutual covenants herein contained, UBS AM and the Sub-"
"5660","Adviser agree as follows:"
"5661","1.	Appointment.  UBS AM hereby appoints the Sub-"
"5662","Adviser as an investment sub-adviser with respect to the"
"5663","Segment for the period and on the terms set forth in this"
"5664","Agreement. The Sub-Adviser accepts that appointment"
"5665","and agrees to render the services herein set forth, for the"
"5666","compensation herein provided."
"5667","2.	Duties as Sub-Adviser."
"5668","(a)	Subject to the supervision and direction of the Trust's"
"5669","Board of Trustees (the Board), oversight by UBS AM and"
"5670","any applicable written guidelines adopted by the Board or"
"5671","UBS AM, the Sub-Adviser will provide a continuous"
"5672","investment program for the Segment, including"
"5673","investment research and discretionary management with"
"5674","respect to all securities and investments and cash"
"5675","equivalents in the Segment. The Sub-Adviser will"
"5676","determine from time to time what investments will be"
"5677","purchased, retained or sold by the Segment.  The Sub-"
"5678","Adviser will be responsible for placing purchase and sell"
"5679","orders for investments and for other related transactions"
"5680","for the Segment. The Sub-Adviser understands that the"
"5681","Portfolio's assets need to be managed so as to permit the"
"5682","Portfolio to qualify or to continue to qualify as a regulated"
"5683","investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal"
"5684","Revenue Code, as amended (Code).  The Sub-Adviser will"
"5685","provide services under this Agreement in accordance with"
"5686","the Portfolio's investment objective, policies and"
"5687","restrictions as stated in the Trust's currently effective"
"5688","registration statement under the 1940 Act, and any"
"5689","amendments or supplements thereto (Registration
Statement), subject to any written investment guidelines"
"5690","or instructions provided by the Board or UBS AM with"
"5691","respect to the Segment.  The Sub-Adviser, on each"
"5692","business day (as such term is defined in the Portfolio's"
"5693","then-current prospectus), shall provide UBS AM and the"
"5694","Trust's custodian such information as UBS AM and the"
"5695","Trust's custodian may reasonably request relating to all"
"5696","transactions concerning the Segment."
"5697","UBS AM hereby designates and appoints the Sub-Adviser"
"5698","as its and the Portfolio's limited purpose agent and"
"5699","attorney-in-fact, without further prior approval of UBS AM"
"5700","(except as expressly provided for herein or as may be"
"5701","required by law) to make and execute, in the name and on"
"5702","behalf of the Portfolio with respect to the Segment, all"
"5703","agreements, instruments and other documents and to take"
"5704","all such other action which the Sub-Adviser considers"
"5705","necessary or advisable to carry out its duties hereunder. By"
"5706","way of example and not by way of limitation, in connection"
"5707","with any purchase for the  Segment of securities or"
"5708","instruments that are not registered under the U.S."
"5709","Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act),"
"5710","the Sub-Adviser shall have the full power and authority,"
"5711","among other things, to: (i) commit to purchase such"
"5712","securities for the Segment on the terms and conditions"
"5713","under which such securities are offered; (ii) execute such"
"5714","account opening and other agreements, instruments and"
"5715","documents (including, without limitation, purchase"
"5716","agreements, subscription documents, ISDA and other swap"
"5717","and derivative documents), and make such commitments,"
"5718","as may be required in connection with the purchase and"
"5719","sale of such securities or instruments; (iii) represent that"
"5720","the Portfolio is an accredited investor as defined in Rule"
"5721","501 (a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act and a"
"5722","Qualified Institutional Buyer as defined in Rule 144A (a)"
"5723","(1) (i) under the Securities Act; and (iv) commit that such"
"5724","securities will not be offered or sold by the Segment except"
"5725","in compliance with the registration requirements of the"
"5726","Securities Act or an exemption therefrom. This power-of-"
"5727","attorney is a continuing power-of-attorney and shall"
"5728","remain in full force and effect until revoked by UBS AM or"
"5729","the Trust in writing, but any such revocation shall not affect"
"5730","any transaction initiated prior to receipt by the Sub-Adviser"
"5731","of such notice."
"5732","When investing in non-US securities, the Sub-Advisor is"
"5733","responsible for identifying and complying with all"
"5734","applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which"
"5735","the security is traded. The Sub-Advisor shall use the degree"
"5736","of care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent"
"5737","investment manager would exercise under the"
"5738","circumstances not to establish or add to existing positions"
"5739","in securities that are subject to any applicable foreign"
"5740","ownership limits or levels (FOL'') at a time when it is
reasonably foreseeable that such purchases will have to be
sold due to FOL limits or levels.


(b)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will not consult with any
other sub-adviser (Other Sub-Adviser) for the Trust or
Portfolio concerning any transaction by the Segment in
securities or other assets, including (i) the purchase by the
Segment of a security issued by the Other Sub-Adviser, or
an affiliate of the Other Sub-Adviser, to the Trust or
Portfolio except as permitted by the 1940 Act or (ii)
transactions by the Segment in any security for which the
Other Sub-Adviser, or its affiliate, is the principal
underwriter.

(c)	Unless otherwise instructed by UBS AM or the Trust,
the Sub-Adviser agrees that it will be responsible for voting
proxies of issuers of securities held by the Segment.  The
Sub-Adviser further agrees that it has adopted or will adopt
written proxy voting procedures that comply with the
requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, as amended (Advisers Act) (Proxy Voting"
"5741","Policy), and shall provide a copy of such Proxy Voting
Policy to the Board.  The Sub-Adviser shall also provide its
Proxy Voting Policy, and if requested by UBS AM, a
summary of such Proxy Voting Policy for inclusion in the
Trust's registration statement, and will provide UBS AM
with any material amendment to the Proxy Voting Policy
within a reasonable time after such amendment has taken
effect.  The Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will provide
the Board on or before August 1st of each year, or more
frequently as the Board may reasonably request, with a
written report of the proxies voted during the most recent
12-month period ending June 30, or such other period as
the Board may designate, in a format that shall comply
with the 1940 Act and that shall be acceptable to the Board.

(d) 	The Sub-Adviser agrees that upon the request of UBS
AM or the Board, Sub-Adviser shall use reasonable efforts
to exercise any known rights incident to the securities held
by the Segment in the context of a bankruptcy or other
reorganization.  The Sub-Adviser further agrees that it will
keep UBS AM fully informed about any such actions that it
intends to take.

(e)	The Sub-Adviser agrees that it will place orders with
brokers, and seek to obtain best execution, in accordance
with the Sub-Adviser's brokerage and trading policies,
taking into account best price as an important factor in this
decision In using brokers to execute portfolio transactions
on behalf of the Segment, the Sub-Adviser may, in its
discretion, use brokers that provide the Sub-Adviser with
research, analysis, advice and similar services, and the Sub-
Adviser may pay to those brokers in return for brokerage
and research services a higher commission than may be
charged by other brokers, subject to the Sub-Adviser's
determination in good faith that such commission is
reasonable in terms either of the particular transaction or
of the overall responsibility of the Sub-Adviser to the
Segment and its other clients and that the total
commissions paid by the Segment will be reasonable in
relation to the benefits to the Segment over the long term.
In no instance will the Sub-Adviser, in its management of
the Segment, purchase portfolio securities from, or sell
portfolio securities to, UBS AM or the Sub-Adviser, the
Portfolio's principal underwriter, or any affiliated person
thereof identified by UBS AM to the Sub-Adviser, except in
accordance with the federal securities laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder.  The Sub-Adviser may
aggregate sales and purchase orders with respect to the
assets of the Segment with similar orders being made
simultaneously for other accounts advised by the Sub-
Adviser or its affiliates.  Whenever the Sub-Adviser
simultaneously places orders to purchase or sell the same
security on behalf of the Segment and one or more other
accounts advised by the Sub-Adviser, the orders will be
allocated as to price and amount among all such accounts
in a manner believed to be equitable over time to each
account.  UBS AM recognizes that in some cases this
procedure may adversely affect the results obtained for the
Segment.

Subject to the Sub-Adviser's obligation to seek best
execution, UBS AM agrees that the Sub-Adviser, in its sole
discretion, may place transactions on behalf of the
Portfolio or Segment and the Trust with any broker-dealer
deemed to be an affiliate (including affiliated Futures
Commissions Merchants (FCMs)) of the Sub-Adviser (the
Affiliated Broker-Dealers) so long as such transactions
are effected in conformity with the requirements (including
any applicable exemptions and administrative
interpretations set forth in Part 2A of the Sub-Adviser's
Form ADV Registration Statement on file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (Form ADV)) of
Section 11(a)(1)(H) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the 1934 Act), and in compliance with Rules 17e-1 or 10f-
3 under the 1940 Act or other applicable rules and the
Trust's policies and procedures thereunder.  In all such
dealings, the Affiliated Broker-Dealers shall be authorized
and entitled to retain any commissions, remuneration or
profits which may be made in such transactions and shall
not be liable to account for the same to UBS AM, the
Portfolio or the Trust.  In the event Sub-Adviser becomes
affiliated (as defined under the 1940 Act) with a broker-
dealer during the term of this Agreement, Sub-Adviser
shall obtain the approval of the Trust's Board of Trustees
prior to commencement of transactions with such broker-
dealer on behalf of the Segment.

UBS AM further authorizes the Sub-Adviser and its
Affiliated Broker-Dealers (if any) to execute agency cross
transactions (the Cross Transactions) on behalf of the
Portfolio and the Trust. Cross Transactions are transactions
which may be effected by the Affiliated Broker-Dealers
acting for both the Portfolio or the Trust and the
counterparty to the transaction.  Cross Transactions enable
the Sub-Adviser to purchase or sell a block of securities for
the Portfolio or the Trust at a set price and possibly avoid
an unfavorable price movement that may be created
through entrance into the market with such purchase or
sale order.  As such, the Sub-Adviser believes that Cross
Transactions can provide meaningful benefits for the
Portfolio and the Trust and its clients generally.  UBS AM  is
aware that in a Cross Transaction an Affiliated Broker-
Dealer will be receiving commissions from both sides of the
trade and, therefore, there is a potentially conflicting
division of loyalties and responsibilities.  Sub-Adviser shall
effect such Cross Transactions in compliance with Rule
206(3)-2 under the Advisers Act, Rule 17a-7 under the 1940
Act, and any other applicable provisions of the federal
securities laws and shall provide UBS AM with periodic
reports describing such agency cross transactions.  UBS AM
understands that the authority of the Sub-Adviser to
execute agency Cross Transactions for the Segment is
terminable at will without penalty, effective upon receipt
by the Sub-Adviser of written notice from UBS AM, and
that the failure to terminate such authorization will result in
its continuation.

(f)	The Sub-Adviser shall, in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Rule 31a-1 and Rule 31a-2 under
the 1940 Act, maintain separate detailed records of all
matters pertaining to its management of the Segment,
including, without limitation, brokerage and other records
of all securities transactions. Any such records required to
be maintained by the Portfolio or the Trust pursuant to
Rule 31a-1 and Rule 31a-2 prepared or maintained by the
Sub-Adviser are the property of the Trust and will be
surrendered promptly to the Trust upon request; provided,
however, that the Sub-Adviser may make copies of such
records to the extent required by applicable law. The Sub-
Adviser further agrees to furnish the Board and UBS AM
with such periodic and special reports as the Board or UBS
AM may request.

(g)	At such times as shall be reasonably requested by the
Board or UBS AM, the Sub-Adviser will provide the Board
and UBS AM with economic and investment analyses and
reports as well as quarterly reports setting forth the
performance of the Segment and analysis hereof  and
make available to the Board and UBS AM any economic,
statistical and investment services that the Sub-Adviser
normally makes available to its institutional or other
customers.

(h)	In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board,
as amended from time to time, the Sub-Adviser is
responsible for assisting the Board and UBS AM in the fair
valuation of any portfolio securities in the Segment
requiring such fair valuation and, upon request, will use its
reasonable efforts to arrange for the provision of a price or
prices from one or more parties independent of the Sub-
Adviser for each portfolio security for which the custodian
does not obtain prices in the ordinary course of business
from an automated pricing service.

The Sub-Adviser also will provide such information or
perform such additional acts as it typically performs as a
sub-adviser with respect to a registered investment
company or series thereof and that may be necessary for
the Sub-Adviser to provide or perform so that  the Trust or
UBS AM may comply with their respective obligations
under applicable federal securities laws, including, without
limitation, the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1934 Act, the
Securities Act, and any rule or regulation thereunder.

3.	Further Duties.  In all matters relating to the
performance of this Agreement, and to the extent
applicable to the Sub-Adviser, the Sub-Adviser will seek to
act in conformity with the Trust's Trust Instrument, By-
Laws and Registration Statement, the Trust's policies and
procedures for compliance by the Trust with the Federal
Securities Laws (as that term is defined in Rule 38a-1 under
the 1940 Act) provided to the Sub-Adviser (together, the
Trust Compliance Procedures) and with the written
instructions and written directions of the Board and UBS
AM, and will comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act,
and the Advisers Act, and the rules under each, the Code,
and all other federal and state laws and regulations
applicable to the Trust and the Portfolio. UBS AM agrees to
provide to the Sub-Adviser copies of the Trust's Trust
Instrument, By-Laws, Registration Statement, Trust's
Compliance Procedures, written instructions and directions
of the Board and UBS AM, and any amendments or
supplements to any of these materials as soon as
practicable after such materials are made available to the
Sub-Adviser.  UBS AM further agrees to identify to the Sub-
Adviser in writing any broker-dealers that are affiliated with
UBS AM (other than UBS Financial Services Inc. and UBS
Asset Management (US) Inc.).

In order to assist the Trust and the Trust's Chief
Compliance Officer (the Trust CCO) to satisfy the
requirements contained in Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act
with respect to the Portfolio, the Sub-Adviser shall provide
to the Trust CCO:  (i) direct access to the Sub-Adviser's
chief compliance officer and/or other senior compliance
personnel, as reasonably requested by the Trust CCO; (ii)
quarterly reports confirming that the Sub-Adviser has
complied with the Trust Compliance Procedures in
managing the Segment; and (iii) quarterly certifications
that there were no Material Compliance Matters (as that
term is defined by Rule 38a-1(e)(2)) that arose under the
Trust Compliance Procedures that related to the Sub-
Adviser's management of the Segment.

The Sub-Adviser shall promptly provide the Trust CCO with
copies of: (i) the Sub-Adviser's policies and procedures for
compliance by the Sub-Adviser with the Federal Securities
Laws (together, the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures),
and (ii) any material changes to the Sub-Adviser
Compliance Procedures.  The Sub-Adviser shall cooperate
fully with the Trust CCO and respond to requests so as to
facilitate the Trust CCO's performance of the Trust CCO's
responsibilities under Rule 38a-1 to review, evaluate and
report to the Trust's Board on the operation of the Sub-
Adviser Compliance Procedures, and shall promptly report
to the Trust CCO any Material Compliance Matter arising
under the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures involving
the Segment.  The Sub-Adviser shall provide to the Trust
CCO:  (i) quarterly reports confirming the Sub-Adviser's
compliance with the Sub-Adviser Compliance Procedures
in managing the Segment, and (ii) certifications that there
were no Material Compliance Matters involving the Sub-
Adviser that arose under the Sub-Adviser Compliance
Procedures that affected the Segment.  At least annually,
the Sub-Adviser shall provide a certification to the Trust
CCO to the effect that the Sub-Adviser has in place and has
implemented policies and procedures that are reasonably
designed to ensure compliance by the Sub-Adviser with
any applicable Federal Securities Laws.

The Sub-Adviser will promptly provide UBS AM with
information (including information that is required to be
disclosed in the Trust's Registration Statement) with
respect to the portfolio managers responsible for the
Portfolio or Segment and any changes in the portfolio
managers responsible for the Portfolio or Segment.

The Sub-Adviser will promptly notify UBS AM of any
pending investigation, material litigation, administrative
proceeding or any other significant regulatory inquiry
known to the Sub-Adviser and of which the Sub-Adviser is
subject.

The Sub-Adviser will cooperate with UBS AM and/or the
Trust and respond to requests in responding to any
regulatory or compliance examinations or inspections
(including information requests) relating to the Trust, the
Portfolio or UBS AM brought by any governmental or
regulatory authorities having appropriate jurisdiction
(including, but not limited to, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC)).

4.	Expenses.  During the term of this Agreement, the Sub-
Adviser will bear all expenses incurred by it in connection
with its services under this Agreement.  The Sub-Adviser
shall not be responsible for any expenses incurred by the
Trust, the Portfolio or UBS AM, except as otherwise
specifically provided herein.

Upon request by UBS AM, Sub-Adviser agrees to reimburse
UBS AM or the Trust for costs associated with generating
and distributing any Registration Statement (as defined
herein)  for when the Sub-Adviser is given a copy of a draft
of such Registration Statement, is provided an opportunity
to review the disclosures contain therein and provide UBS
AM or the Trust or any of their respective agents with
modifications to such disclosures, and does not notify UBS
AM, the Trust or any of their respective agents of a material
fact known to the Sub-Adviser respecting or relating to the
Sub-Adviser that is not contained in the Registration
Statement, but that is required to be disclosed therein to
avoid such disclosure from being misleading.  The Sub-
Adviser shall bear all reasonable expenses of the Trust, if
any, arising out of and relating primarily to, an assignment
or change in control of the Sub-Adviser.

5.	Compensation.

(a)	For the services provided and the expenses assumed by
the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, UBS AM, not
the Portfolio, will pay to the Sub-Adviser a fee, computed
daily and payable monthly, at an annual rate of   % of the
average daily net assets of the Portfolio or Segment
allocated to its management (computed in the manner
specified in the Management Agreement), and will provide
the Sub-Adviser with a schedule showing the manner in
which the fee was computed.  If the Sub-Adviser is
managing a Segment, its fees will be based on the value of
the assets of the Portfolio within the Sub-Adviser's
Segment.

(b)	The fee shall be accrued daily and payable monthly to
the Sub-Adviser on or before the last business day of the
next succeeding calendar month.

(c)	For those periods in which UBS AM has agreed to waive
all or a portion of its management fee, UBS AM may ask
the Sub-Adviser to waive the same proportion of its fees,
but the Sub-Adviser is under no obligation to do so.

(d)	If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates
before the end of any month, the fee for the period from
the effective date to the end of the month or from the
beginning of such month to the date of termination, as the
case may be, shall be pro-rated according to the proportion
which such period bears to the full month in that such
effectiveness or termination occurs.

6. Limitation of Liability.

(a) 	The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error of
judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the
Portfolio, the Trust or its shareholders or by UBS AM in
connection with the matters to which this Agreement
relates, except a loss resulting from willful misfeasance,
bad faith or negligence on the part of the Sub-Adviser in
the performance of its duties pursuant to this Agreement
or from reckless disregard by the Sub-Adviser of its
obligations and duties under this Agreement.

(b)	In no event will the Sub-Adviser have any responsibility
for any other portfolio of the Trust, for any portion of the
Portfolio not managed by the Sub-Adviser or for the acts or
omissions of any Other Sub-Adviser to the Trust or
Portfolio. In particular, in the event the Sub-Adviser
manages less than 100% of the assets in the Portfolio, and
has managed such Segment in accordance with Section
2(a) of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall have no
responsibility for the Portfolio's being in violation of any
applicable law or regulation, or any investment objective,
investment policy or restriction applicable to the Portfolio
as a whole or for the Portfolio's failing to qualify as a
regulated investment company under the Code, unless
such violation was due to the Sub-Advisers failure to
comply with written guidelines adopted by the Board or
UBS AM and provided to the Sub-Adviser.

Nothing in this section shall be deemed a limitation or
waiver of any obligation or duty that may not by law be
limited or waived.

7.	Representations of Sub-Adviser.  The Sub-Adviser
represents, warrants and agrees as follows:

(a)	The Sub-Adviser (i) is registered as an investment
