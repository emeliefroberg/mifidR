"23029","designated from time to time in such manner and on such basis as the Board"
"23030","of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems fair and equitable, and any"
"23031","General Items so allocated to a particular class shall belong to that"
"23032","class.  Each such allocation by the Board of Directors shall be conclusive"
"23033","and binding for all purposes."
"23034","	(2)	Liabilities Belonging to a"

"23082","distribution upon liquidation of any other series or class.  The assets so"
"23083","distributable to the shareholder of any particular series or class shall"
"23084","be distributed among such shareholders according to their respective"
"23085","rights taking into account the proper allocation of expenses being borne"

"23398","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"23399","The Shareholders and Board of Directors"
"23400","Principal Funds, Inc."
"23401","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of"
"23402","Principal Funds, Inc. as of and for the period ended October 31, 2011,"
"23403","in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"23404","Oversight Board (United States), we considered its internal controls"
"23405","over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"23406","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"23407","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"23408","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"23409","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Principal Funds, Inc.'s"
"23410","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no"
"23411","such opinion."
"23412","The management of Principal Funds, Inc. is responsible for establishing"
"23413","and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"23414","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"23415","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"23416","controls. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"23417","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"23418","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"23419","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"23420","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"23421","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"23422","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"23423","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"23424","company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"23425","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"23426","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that"
"23427","receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in"
"23428","accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the"
"23429","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"23430","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a"
"23431","company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"23432","statements."
"23433","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"23434","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"23435","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"23436","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"23437","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"23438","procedures may deteriorate."
"23439","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"23440","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"23441","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"23442","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"23443","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"23444","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"23445","possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or"
"23446","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"23447","timely basis."
"23448","Our consideration of Principal Funds, Inc.'s internal control over"
"23449","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"23450","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"23451","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"23452","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"23453","States). However, we noted no deficiencies in Principal Funds, Inc.'s"
"23454","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"23455","controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material"
"23456","weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2011."
"23457","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"23458","management and the Board of Directors of Principal Funds, Inc. and the"
"23459","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"23460","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"24743","Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a"
"24744","securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread"
"24745","another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if"
"24746","the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of commission is"
"24747","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research products"
"24748","and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This determination, with"
"24749","respect to brokerage and research products and/or services, may be viewed in"
"24750","terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities"
"24751","which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to each Series as"
"24752","well as to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all"
"24753","such services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the"
"24754","Series.  In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by"

"24761","periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may reasonably request.  In"

"24763","Advisor hereby agrees that all records that it maintains for each Series are"
"24764","the property of the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule"

"25026"," HERNDON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC SUB-ADVISED FUND"
"25027","AGREEMENT executed as of the 27th of June, 2011, by and between PRINCIPAL"
"25028","MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, an Iowa corporation (hereinafter called the
Manager), and HERNDON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC, a Delaware Limited"
"25029","Liability Company (hereinafter called the Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each series
of the Principal  Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the 1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it with
portfolio selection and related research and statistical services in
connection with the investment advisory services for each series
identified in Appendix A (hereinafter called the Series), which the
Manager has agreed to provide to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to
furnish such services; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies properly
certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly
provide the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated of
any amendment or supplement thereto:

 	(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) with the Fund;

 	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC);

 	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services
provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the
Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services
described in Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of the
securities and other assets of the Series, subject to the control
and direction of the Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for
the period and on the terms hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor
accepts such appointment and agrees to furnish the services
hereinafter set forth for the compensation herein provided. The
Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an
independent contractor and shall, except as expressly provided or
authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the Fund or
the Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund
or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited
to research, advice and supervision for the Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund (or any
appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time to
time as economic conditions require, a recommended investment
program for the Series consistent with the Series' investment
objective and policies.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders for
the purchase and sale of securities without prior consultation
with the Manager and without regard to the length of time the
securities have been held, the resulting rate of portfolio
turnover or any tax considerations, subject always to the
provisions of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws,
the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be
from time to time in effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the
officers, in taking such steps as are reasonably necessary or
appropriate to carry out the decisions of its Board of
Directors, and any appropriate committees of such Board,
regarding the general conduct of the investment business of the
Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services provided to the Series, its compliance with
the 1940 Act and the regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder
and the Series' investment strategies and restrictions as stated
in the Fund's Prospectus and Statement of Additional
Information, subject to receipt of such additional information
as may be required from the Manager and provided in accordance
with Section 11(d) of this Agreement. The Sub-Advisor has no
responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except
insofar as is directly related to the services it provides to
the Series.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and
in such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem
appropriate in order to enable it to determine that the
investment policies, procedures and approved investment program
of the Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance in the determination of the
fair value of certain securities that are, or were, held in the
Series portfolio when reliable market quotations are not readily
available for purposes of calculating net asset value in
accordance with procedures and methods established by the Fund's
Board of Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other
personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and
(ii) administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical
personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of
its duties under this Agreement.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission
merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect
all transactions for the Series, place all necessary orders with
broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-dealers),
and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the extent
consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the
Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell
orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event
allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as the
expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the
Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the
most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to
the Fund and to other clients.  The Manager recognizes that, in
some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the position
that may be acquired or sold for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor
will report on such allocations at the request of the Manager,
the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing such
information as the number of aggregated trades to which the
Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades were
directed and the basis for the allocation for the aggregated
trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain
execution of transactions for the Series at prices which are
advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that are
reasonable in relation to the benefits received. However, the
Sub-Advisor may select brokers-dealers on the basis that they
provide brokerage, research or other services or products to the
Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the
Sub-Advisor may pay a broker -dealer an amount of commission for
effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of
commission or dealer spread another broker-dealer would have
charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor
determines in good faith that such amount of commission is
reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and
research products and/or services provided by such broker-
dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and
research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of
either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have
with respect to the Series as well as to other accounts over
which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such services
or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the
Series. In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not
be utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under
any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that
all conditions of such order are complied with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the
Series as are required of an investment advisor of a registered
investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisers Act), and the
rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such
periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may
reasonably request.  In compliance with the requirements of Rule
31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all
records that it maintains for the Series are the property of the
Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the Series
and that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the
1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund
any records that it maintains for the Series upon request by the
Fund or the Manager provided that the Sub-Advisor may retain the
original or copies of such records for its own regulatory or
other proper purposes.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as
the same may be amended from time to time.  The Manager
acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current Code of
Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to the Manager a
copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of
Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request,
furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio transactions
and reports on investments held by the Series, all in such
detail as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably request.  The
Sub-Advisor will make available its officers and employees to
meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal
place of business on due notice to review the investments of the
Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-
advisor and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to
comply with their respective obligations under applicable laws,
including, without limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment
Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and any rule
or regulation thereunder.  Sub-Advisor will advise Manager of
any changes in Sub-Advisor's Senior Management (i.e. Chief
Investment Officer and Chief Executive Officer) within a
reasonable time after any such change.  Manager acknowledges
receipt of Sub-Advisor's Form ADV more than 48 hours prior to
the execution of this Agreement.

(n)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies solicited
by, or with respect to, the issuers of securities held in the
Series.  The Manager shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor
all proxy solicitation materials that it receives and shall
assist Sub-Advisor in its efforts to conduct the proxy voting
process.

     3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-
Advisor will not consult with any other investment advisory firm
that provides investment advisory services to any investment company
sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company regarding transactions
for the Series in securities or other assets.

     4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the Fund, the
Manager shall pay the compensation specified in Appendix A to this
Agreement.

     5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, the
Fund or its shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager, the
Series or the Fund resulting from any error of judgment made in the
good faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's duties under this Agreement
or as a result of the failure by the Manager or any of its
affiliates to comply with the terms of this Agreement except for
losses resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of the
Sub-Advisor or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents
(excluding any broker-dealer selected by the Sub-Advisor), or
affiliates provided that nothing herein stated shall be construed as
denying or limiting from the Manager, the Series or the Fund any
remedies to which it is entitled under applicable federal or state
securities laws.

     6.	Indemnification

The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sub-Advisor
from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities or damages
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and other related expenses),
(Losses) howsoever arising, from or in connection with this
Agreement or the performance by the Sub-Advisor of its duties
hereunder, so long as the Sub-Advisor shall, after receipt of notice
of any claim or commencement of any action, promptly notify the
Manager in writing of the claim or commencement of such action.  The
Manager shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim or
action effected without its written consent.  Nothing contained
herein shall require the Manager to indemnify the Sub-Advisor for
Losses resulting from the Sub-Advisor's willful misfeasance, bad
faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or from
its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this
Agreement.

     7.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons
affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third parties
to better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations under
this Agreement for the provision of certain personnel and facilities
to the Sub- Advisor, subject to written notification to and approval
of the Manager and, where required by applicable law, the Board of
Directors of the Fund. The written notification to and approval of
the Manager or the Board of Directors shall not apply with respect
to arrangements entered into by the Sub-Advisor in the ordinary
conduct of its business as a registered investment advisor.

     8.	Regulation

The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and administrative
bodies having jurisdiction over the services provided pursuant to
this Agreement any information, reports or other material which any
such body may request or require pursuant to applicable laws and
regulations.

     9.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement

This Agreement shall become effective as of the date of its

PRINCIPAL  FUNDS, INC.
AMENDED AND RESTATED SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT
SMALLCAP VALUE FUND II,  MIDCAP VALUE FUND I AND GLOBAL MULTI-STRATEGY
FUND

     AGREEMENT executed as of 24th of October, 2011, by and between
PRINCIPAL MANAGEMENT CORPORATION (hereinafter called the Manager), and
LOS ANGELES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND EQUITY RESEARCH, INC. (LA Capital)
(hereinafter called the Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each
Series of Principal  Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the 1940 Act); and

     WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it
with investment advisory services with respect to assets allocated by
the Manager for management by the Sub-Adviser for a portion of the
portfolios of the SmallCap Value Fund II,  MidCap Value Fund I, and the
Global Multi-Strategy Fund (each hereinafter called the Series), which
the Manager has agreed to provide to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor
desires to furnish such services; and

     WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies
properly certified or authenticated of each of the following and will
promptly provide the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or
authenticated of any amendment or supplement thereto:

	(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) with the
Fund;

	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and
services to be provided by the Sub-Advisor.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the
Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to act as the Manager's
agent and attorney-in-fact with respect to the investment and
reinvestment of assets in the Series with full power and authority
to direct any custodian of the assets of the Series to purchase,
sell or exchange any stocks, bonds, or other securities or such
other assets which are acceptable to the Sub-Advisor
(individually, security and collectively, securities) and to
issue directly to a broker or dealer such orders for the purchase,
sale or exchange of securities or other property, as the Sub-
Advisor may deem appropriate and without prior consultation with
the Manager, subject to the control and direction of the Manager
and the Fund's Board of Directors, for the period and on the terms
hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor accepts such appointment
and agrees to furnish the services hereinafter set forth for the
compensation herein provided. The Sub-Advisor shall for all
purposes herein be deemed to be an independent contractor and
shall, except as expressly provided or authorized, have no
authority to act for or represent the Fund or the Manager in any
way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not
limited to research, advice and supervision for the Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or
any appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time
to time as conditions require, a recommended investment
program for the Series consistent with each Series investment
objective and policies.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders
for the purchase and sale of securities without prior
consultation with the Manager and without regard to the length
of time the securities have been held, the resulting rate of
portfolio turnover or any tax considerations, subject always
to the provisions of the Fund's registration statement,
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and the requirements of
the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be from time to time
in effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by
the officers, in taking such steps as are necessary or
appropriate to carry out the decisions of its Board of
Directors, and any appropriate committees of such Board,
regarding the general conduct of the investment business of
the Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services obligations, compliance with the 1940 Act
and the regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission thereunder and the Series' investment strategies
and restrictions as stated in the Fund's prospectus and
statement of additional information.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and
in such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem
appropriate in order to enable it to determine that the
investment policies, procedures and approved investment
program of the Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance and recommendations for the
determination of the fair value of certain securities when
reliable market quotations are not readily available for
purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance with
procedures and methods established by the Fund's Board of
Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and
other personnel required for it to execute its duties
faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including
bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment necessary for
the efficient conduct of the investment advisory affairs of
the Series. Except for expenses specifically assumed or agreed
to be paid by the Sub-Advisor under this Agreement, the Sub-
Advisor shall not be liable for any expenses of the Manager,
the Fund or the Series including, without limitation, (i)
interest and taxes, (ii) brokerage commissions and other costs
in connection with the purchase or sale of securities or other
investment instruments with respect to the Series, and (iii)
custodian fees and expenses.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission
merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect
all transactions for the Series, place all necessary orders
with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-
dealers), and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the
extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders
for the Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase
or sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such
event allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well
as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by
the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be
the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Fund and to other clients.  The Sub-Advisor
will report on such allocations at the request of the Manager,
the Fund or the Fund's Board of Directors providing such
information as the number of aggregated trades to which the
Series was a party, the broker-dealers to whom such trades
were directed and the basis for the allocation for the
aggregated trades.  The Sub-Advisor shall use its best efforts
to obtain execution of transactions for the Series at prices
which are advantageous to the Series and at commission rates
that are reasonable in relation to the benefits received.
However, the Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the
basis that they provide brokerage, research or other services
or products to the Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with
applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an
amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction in
excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread another
broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that
transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that
such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the
value of the brokerage and research products and/or services
provided by such broker or dealer. This determination, with
respect to brokerage and research products and/or services,
may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction
or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its
affiliates have with respect to the Series as well as to
accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Not
all such services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor
in managing the Series.  In addition, joint repurchase or
other accounts may not be utilized by the Series except to the
extent permitted under any exemptive order obtained by the
Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions of such order are
complied with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the
Series as are required of an investment advisor of a
registered investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisers"
"25031","Act), and the rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the
Manager with such periodic and special reports as the Fund or
Manager may reasonably request.  In compliance with the
requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor
hereby agrees that all records that it maintains for the
Series are the property of the Fund, agrees to preserve for
the periods described by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act any
records that it maintains for the Series and that are required
to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and further
agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any records that it
maintains for a Series upon request by the Fund or the
Manager. The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the
maintenance of Fund records except insofar as is directly
related to the services the Sub-Advisor provides to a Series.


(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as
the same may be amended from time to time.  The Manager
acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current Code
of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to the Manager
a copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of
Ethics along with certification that the Sub-Advisor has
implemented procedures for administering the Sub-Advisor's
Code of Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request,
furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio transactions
and reports on investments held by a Series, all in such
detail as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably request.  The
Sub-Advisor will make available its officers and employees to
meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's
principal place of business on due notice to review the
investments of a Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-
advisor and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to
comply with their respective obligations under applicable
laws, including, without limitation, the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment
Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and any rule
or regulation thereunder.



(n)	Vote proxies received on behalf of the Series in a manner
consistent with Sub-Advisor's proxy voting policies and
procedures and provide a record of votes cast containing all
of the voting information required by Form N-PX in an
electronic format to enable the Series to file Form N-PX as
required by SEC rule.

(o)	Respond to tender offers, rights offerings and other voluntary
corporate action requests affecting securities held by the
Fund and complete and file notices of claims in connection
with class action lawsuits concerning securities owned by the
Fund.

3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-
Advisor will not consult with any other investment advisory firm
that provides investment sub-advisory services to the Fund or a
fund that is under common control with the Fund regarding
transactions for the Fund in the securities or other assets
allocated to the Sub-Advisor pursuant to this Agreement, except as
provided by Rule 12d-3-1 under the 1940 Act.

	4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to the Series,
the Manager shall pay the compensation specified in Appendix A to
this Agreement.

     5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager,
the Fund or its shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager
or the Fund resulting from any error of judgment made in the good
faith exercise of the Sub-Advisor's investment discretion in
connection with selecting investments for a Series or as a result
of the failure by the Manager or any of its affiliates to comply
with the terms of this Agreement and/or insurance laws and rules
except for losses resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or
gross negligence of, or from reckless disregard of, the duties of
the Sub-Advisor or any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents, or affiliates.  The Sub-Advisor shall not have any
responsibilities with respect to any assets of the Fund other than
the Series.  The Manager shall not be responsible for any loss
incurred by reason of any act or omission of any dealer or broker,
or the Manager, or any custodian.

The Sub-Advisor shall be responsible only for managing the Series
in good faith and in accordance with the investment objectives,
fundamental policies and restrictions, and shall have no
responsibility whatsoever for, and shall incur no liability on
account of (i) selection or establishment of such investment
objectives, fundamental policies and restrictions (ii) advice on,
or management of, any other assets for Manager or the Fund, (iii)
filing of any tax or information returns or forms, withholding or
paying any taxes, or seeking any exemption or refund for the
Manager or the Fund, (iv) registration of the Fund or Series with
any government or agency, or (v) administration of the plans and
trusts investing through the Fund, (vi) overall Fund compliance
with the requirements of the 1940 Act, which requirements are
outside of the Sub-Advisor's control, and any requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
which are outside of the Sub-Advisor's control and shall be
indemnified and held harmless by Manager for any loss in carrying
out the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including
reasonable attorney's fees, indemnification to the Fund, or any
shareholder thereof and, brokers and commission merchants, fines,
taxes, penalties and interest.  Sub-Advisor, however, shall be
liable for any liability, damages, or expenses of Manager or the
Fund arising out of the negligence, malfeasance or violation of
applicable law by any of its employees in providing investment
management services under this Agreement; and, in such cases, the
indemnification by Manager, referred to above, shall be
inapplicable, and the Sub-Advisor shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Fund and Manager for any loss arising therefrom.

     6.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons
affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third parties
to better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations under
this Agreement for the provision of certain personnel and

and approval of the Manager and, where required by applicable law,
the Board of Directors of the Fund.

The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and administrative
bodies having jurisdiction over the services provided pursuant to
this Agreement any information, reports or other material which
any such body may request or require pursuant to applicable laws

Agreement; (iv) it has the authority to enter into and perform the
services contemplated by this Agreement, and (v) it will

1940 Act or otherwise.

execution and, unless otherwise terminated, shall continue in
effect thereafter from year to year provided that the continuance

APPENDIX A


     The Sub-Advisor shall serve as investment sub-advisor for each Series
of the Fund identified below. The Manager will pay the Sub-Advisor, as
full compensation for all services provided under this Agreement, a fee
computed at an annual rate as shown below (the Sub-Advisor Fee):


Series	Sub-Advisor Fee (as a Percentage of
	Daily Net Assets)

SmallCap Value Fund II 	First $100,000,000 of assets	0.50%
	Next $200,000,000 of assets	0.45%
	Assets over $300,000,000	0.35%

 MidCap Value Fund I	All Assets.......................................0.30%

Global Multi-Strategy Fund	First $250,000,000 of assets..............1.00%
	Assets over $250,000,000.................0.90%



























	The Sub-Advisor Percentage Fee shall be accrued for each calendar
day and the sum of the daily fee accruals shall be paid monthly to the
Sub-Advisor. The daily fee accruals will be computed by multiplying the
fraction of one over the number of calendar days in the year by the
applicable annual rate described above and multiplying this product by
the net assets of the Series, as determined in accordance with the
Series' Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information as of the
close of business on the previous business day on which the Series was
open for business. With respect to the SmallCap Value Fund II and MidCap
Value Fund I, cash and cash equivalents shall be included in the Series
net assets calculation up to a maximum of 1.00% of the Series net
assets. If the Manager requests the Sub-Advisor to raise cash in the
Series portfolio in excess of 1.00% of the Series net assets for the
purpose of funding redemptions from the Series, such amount requested
shall be included in the Series net assets calculation.


     If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before the end of
any month, the fee (if any) for the period from the effective date to
the end of such month or from the beginning of such month to the date of
termination, as the case may be, shall be prorated according to the
proportion which such period bears to the full month in which such
effectiveness or termination occurs.

PRINCIPAL FUNDS, INC.
AMENDED AND RESTATED SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT
PRINCIPAL GLOBAL INVESTORS SUB-ADVISED SERIES


AGREEMENT effective as of September 12, 2011, by and between PRINCIPAL
MANAGEMENT CORPORATION (hereinafter called the Manager), and PRINCIPAL
GLOBAL INVESTORS, LLC (hereinafter called the Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each Series
of Principal Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the 1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it with
portfolio selection and related research and statistical services in
connection with the investment advisory services for each Series of the
Fund identified in Appendix A hereto (hereinafter called Series), which
the Manager has agreed to provide to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires
to furnish such services; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies properly
certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly
provide the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated of
any amendment or supplement thereto:

 	(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) with the Fund;

 	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

 	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services
to be provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the
Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services
described in Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of the
securities and other assets of each Series, subject to the control
and direction of the Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for
the period and on the terms hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor
accepts such appointment and agrees to furnish the services
hereinafter set forth for the compensation herein provided. The
Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an
independent contractor and shall, except as expressly provided or
authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the Fund or
the Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund
or the Manager.

2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited
to research, advice and supervision for each Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or
any appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time
to time as conditions require, a recommended investment program
for each Series consistent with each Series investment objective
and policies.

(c)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders for
the purchase and sale of securities without prior consultation
with the Manager and without regard to the length of time the
securities have been held, the resulting rate of portfolio
turnover or any tax considerations, subject always to the
provisions of the Fund's registration statement, Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws and the requirements of the 1940 Act,
as each of the same shall be from time to time in effect.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the
officers, in taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate
to carry out the decisions of its Board of Directors, and any
appropriate committees of such Board, regarding the general
conduct of the investment business of each Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services obligations, compliance with the 1940 Act and
the regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission thereunder and the Series' investment strategies and
restrictions as stated in the Fund's prospectus and statement of
additional information.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and
in such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem
appropriate in order to enable it to determine that the
investment policies, procedures and approved investment program
of each Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon request, provide assistance and recommendations for the
determination of the fair value of certain securities when
reliable market quotations are not readily available for
purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance with
procedures and methods established by the Fund's Board of
Directors.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other
personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and
(ii) administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical
personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of
the investment advisory affairs of each Series.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission
merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect
all transactions for each Series, place all necessary orders
with broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-
dealers), and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the
extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders
for each Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase
or sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such
event allocation of securities so sold or purchased, as well as
the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the
Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the
most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to
the Fund and to other clients.  The Sub-Advisor will report on
such allocations at the request of the Manager, the Fund or the
Fund's Board of Directors providing such information as the
number of aggregated trades to which each Series was a party,
the broker-dealers to whom such trades were directed and the
basis for the allocation for the aggregated trades.  The Sub-
Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain execution of
transactions for each Series at prices which are advantageous to
the Series and at commission rates that are reasonable in
relation to the benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor may
select brokers or dealers on the basis that they provide
brokerage, research or other services or products to the Sub-
Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-
Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for
effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of
commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have
charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor
determines in good faith that such amount of commission is
reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and
research products and/or services provided by such broker or
dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and
research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of
either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have
with respect to each Series as well as to accounts over which
they exercise investment discretion. Not all such services or
products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series.
 In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be
utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any
exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all
conditions of such order are complied with.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to each
Series as are required of an investment advisor of a registered
investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisers Act), and the
rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such
periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may
reasonably request.  In compliance with the requirements of Rule
31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all
records that it maintains for each Series are the property of
the Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule
31a-2 under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the
Series and that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1
under the 1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly to
the Fund any records that it maintains for a Series upon request
by the Fund or the Manager.  The Sub-Advisor has no
responsibility for the maintenance of Fund records except
insofar as is directly related to the services the Sub-Advisor
provides to a Series.

(k)	Observe and comply with Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted pursuant to that Rule as
the same may be amended from time to time.  The Manager
acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-Advisor's current Code of
Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly forward to the Manager a
copy of any material amendment to the Sub-Advisor's Code of
Ethics along with certification that the Sub-Advisor has
implemented procedures for administering the Sub-Advisor's Code
of Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request,
furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio transactions
and reports on investments held by a Series, all in such detail
as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably request.  The Sub-
Advisor will make available its officers and employees to meet
with the Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's principal place
of business on due notice to review the investments of a Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-
advisor and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to
comply with their respective obligations under applicable laws,
including, without limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment
Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and any rule
or regulation thereunder.

(n)	Vote proxies received on behalf of the Series in a manner
consistent with Sub-Advisor's proxy voting policies and
procedures and provide a record of votes cast containing all of
the voting information required by Form N-PX in an electronic
format to enable the Series to file Form N-PX as required by SEC
rule.

(o)	Respond to tender offers, rights offerings and other voluntary
corporate action requests affecting securities held by the Fund
and complete and file notices of claims in connection with class
action lawsuits concerning securities owned by the Fund.

     3.	Prohibited Conduct

In providing the services described in this agreement, the Sub-
Advisor will not consult with any other investment advisory firm
that provides investment advisory services to any investment company
sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company regarding transactions
for the Fund in securities or other assets.

     4.	Compensation

As full compensation for all services rendered and obligations
assumed by the Sub-Advisor hereunder with respect to each Series,
the Manager shall pay the compensation specified in Appendix A to
this Agreement.

     5.	Liability of Sub-Advisor

Neither the Sub-Advisor nor any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents or affiliates shall be liable to the Manager, the
Fund or its shareholders for any loss suffered by the Manager or the
Fund resulting from any error of judgment made in the good faith
exercise of the Sub-Advisor's investment discretion in connection
with selecting investments for a Series or as a result of the
failure by the Manager or any of its affiliates to comply with the
terms of this Agreement, except for losses resulting from willful
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of, or from reckless
disregard of, the duties of the Sub-Advisor or any of its directors,
officers, employees, agents, or affiliates.

     6.	Supplemental Arrangements

The Sub-Advisor may enter into arrangements with other persons
affiliated with the Sub-Advisor or with unaffiliated third parties
to better enable the Sub-Advisor to fulfill its obligations under
this Agreement for the provision of certain personnel and facilities
to the Sub- Advisor, subject to written notification to and approval
of the Manager and, where required by applicable law, the Board of
Directors of the Fund.

     7.	Regulation

The Sub-Advisor shall submit to all regulatory and administrative
bodies having jurisdiction over the services provided pursuant to
this Agreement any information, reports or other material which any
such body may request or require pursuant to applicable laws and
regulations.

     8.	Duration and Termination of This Agreement

This Agreement shall become effective on the latest of (i) the date
of its execution, (ii) the date of its approval by a majority of the
Board of Directors of the Fund, including approval by the vote of a

the purpose of voting on such approval or (iii) if required by the

the purpose of voting on such approval.

If the shareholders of a Series fail to approve the Agreement or any

the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor will continue to act as Sub-Advisor
with respect to the Series pending the required approval of the
Agreement or its continuance or of any contract with the Sub-Advisor
or a different manager or sub-advisor or other definitive action;
provided, that the compensation received by the Sub-Advisor in
respect to the Series during such period is in compliance with Rule
15a-4 under the 1940 Act.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time without the payment of

APPENDIX A

PGI shall serve as investment sub-advisor for each Fund identified below.
The Manager will pay PGI, as full compensation for all services provided
under this Agreement, a fee, computed and paid monthly, at an annual rate
as shown below of the Fund's net assets as of the first day of each month
allocated to PGI's management.

In calculating the fee for a fund included in Table A, assets of all other
funds included in Table A as well as assets of any unregistered separate
account of Principal Life Insurance Company and any investment company
sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company to which PGI provides
investment advisory services and which invests primarily in fixed-income
securities (except money market separate accounts or investment companies,
and excluding assets of all such separate accounts or investment companies
for which advisory services are provided directly or indirectly by
employees of Post Advisory Group, LLC), as well as the assets of the
Balanced Account of Principal Variable Contracts Fund, will be combined
with the assets of the fund to arrive at net assets.

In calculating the fee for a fund included in Table B and Table D, assets
of any unregistered separate account of Principal Life Insurance Company
and any investment company sponsored by Principal Life Insurance Company
to which PGI provides investment advisory services and which have the same
investment mandate (e.g. MidCap Value) as the fund for which the fee is
calculated, will be combined with the assets of the fund to arrive at net
assets.

If this Agreement becomes effective or terminates before the end of any
month, the fee (if any) for the period from the effective date to the end
of such month or from the beginning of such month to the date of
termination, as the case may be, shall be prorated according to the
proportion which such period bears to the full month in which such
effectiveness or termination occurs.

AGREEMENT executed as of the 24th of October, 2011, by and between
PRINCIPAL MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, an Iowa corporation (hereinafter called
the Manager), and PACIFIC INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY LLC, a Delaware
Limited Liability Company (hereinafter called the Sub-Advisor).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Manager is the manager and investment adviser to each Fund of
the Principal Funds, Inc., (the Fund), an open-end management investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the 1940 Act); and

WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Sub-Advisor to furnish it with
portfolio selection and related research and statistical services in
connection with the investment advisory services for each series
identified in Appendix A (hereinafter called the Series), which the
Manager has agreed to provide to the Fund, and the Sub-Advisor desires to
furnish such services; and

WHEREAS, The Manager has furnished the Sub-Advisor with copies properly
certified or authenticated of each of the following and will promptly
provide the Sub-Advisor with copies properly certified or authenticated of
any amendment or supplement thereto:

 	(a)	Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) with the Fund;

 	(b)	The Fund's registration statement and financial statements as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

 	(c)	The Fund's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws;

(d)	Policies, procedures or instructions adopted or approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund relating to obligations and services
provided by the Sub-Advisor.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

1.	Appointment of Sub-Advisor

In accordance with and subject to the Management Agreement, the
Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Advisor to perform the services
described in Section 2 below for investment and reinvestment of the
securities and other assets of the Series, subject to the control
and direction of the Manager and the Fund's Board of Directors, for
the period and on the terms hereinafter set forth. The Sub-Advisor
accepts such appointment and agrees to furnish the services
hereinafter set forth for the compensation herein provided. The
Sub-Advisor shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an
independent contractor and shall, except as expressly provided or
authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the Fund or
the Manager in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund
or the Manager.


2.	Obligations of and Services to be Provided by the Sub-Advisor

		The Sub-Advisor will:

(a)	Provide investment advisory services, including but not limited
to research, advice and supervision for the Series.

(b)	Furnish to the Board of Directors of the Fund for approval (or
any appropriate committee of such Board), and revise from time
to time as economic conditions require, a recommended investment
program for the Fund consistent with the Series' investment
objective and policies.

(b)	Implement the approved investment program by placing orders for
the purchase and sale of securities without prior consultation
with the Manager and without regard to the length of time the
securities have been held, the resulting rate of portfolio
turnover or any tax considerations, subject always to the
provisions of the Fund's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws,
the requirements of the 1940 Act, as each of the same shall be
from time to time in effect.
The Sub-Advisor further shall have authority to instruct the
custodian to: (i) pay cash for securities and other property
delivered to the custodian for the Series, (ii) deliver or
accept delivery of, upon receipt of payment or payment upon
receipt of, securities, commodities or other property underlying
any futures or options contracts, and other property purchased
or sold for the Series, and (iii) deposit margin or collateral
necessary to meet the obligations of the Series with respect to
any investments made pursuant to the Series' investment
objectives and guidelines.  The Sub-Advisor shall not have the
authority to case the Manager to deliver securities and other
property, or pay cash to the Sub-Advisor other than payment of
the subadvisory fee provided for in this Agreement.
The Sub-Advisor is authorized on behalf of the Series to (i)
enter into agreements and execute any documents (e.g., any
derivatives documentation such as exchange traded and over-the-
counter, as applicable) required to make investments pursuant to
the Series' investment objectives and guidelines, which shall
include market and/or industry standard documentation and the
standard representations contained therein; and (ii) acknowledge
the receipt of brokers' risk disclosure statements, electronic
trading disclosure statements and similar disclosures.

(d)	Advise and assist the officers of the Fund, as requested by the
officers, in taking such steps as are reasonably necessary or
appropriate to carry out the decisions of its Board of
Directors, and any appropriate committees of such Board,
regarding the general conduct of the investment business of the
Series.

(e)	Maintain, in connection with the Sub-Advisor's investment
advisory services provided to the Series, its compliance with
the 1940 Act and the regulations adopted by the Securities and
Exchange Commission thereunder and the Series' investment
strategies and restrictions as stated in the Fund's prospectus
and statement of additional information, subject to receipt of
such additional information as may be required from the Manager
and provided in accordance with Section 12(d) of this Agreement.
The Sub-Advisor has no responsibility for the maintenance of
Fund records except insofar as is directly related to the
services it provides to the Series.

(f)	Report to the Board of Directors of the Fund at such times and
in such detail as the Board of Directors may reasonably deem
appropriate in order to enable it to determine that the
investment policies, procedures and approved investment program
of the Series are being observed.

(g)	Upon reasonable request, provide reasonable assistance to the
Manager in the Manager's determination of the fair value of
certain securities when reliable market quotations are not
readily available for purposes of calculating net asset value in
accordance with procedures and methods established by the Fund's
Board of Directors.  The Manager acknowledges and agrees that
the Sub-Advisor is not a pricing vendor for the Fund or any
Series and does not have responsibility for determining the
market value of any asset in any Series or for calculating the
net asset value of any Series.

(h)	Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and
management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other
personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and
(ii) administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical
personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of
its duties under this Agreement.

(i)	Open accounts with broker-dealers and futures commission
merchants (broker-dealers), select broker-dealers to effect
all transactions for the Series, place all necessary orders with
broker-dealers or issuers (including affiliated broker-dealers),
and negotiate commissions, if applicable. To the extent
consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the
Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell
orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor. In such event
allocation of securities so sold or


purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction,
will be made by the Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor
considers to be consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the
Fund and to other clients and consistent with the Sub-Advisor's
Trade Allocation Policy.  The Manager recognizes that, in some
cases, this procedure may limit the size of the position that
may be acquired or sold for the Series.  The Sub-Advisor will
report reasonable non-confidential information on such
allocations at the reasonable request of the Manager, the Fund
or the Fund's Board of Directors, providing such information as
the broker-dealers to whom such trades were directed.  The Sub-
Advisor shall use its best efforts to obtain best execution of
transactions for the Series at prices which are advantageous to
the Series and at commission rates that are reasonable in
relation to the benefits received. However, the Sub-Advisor may
select brokers or dealers on the basis that they provide
brokerage, research or other services or products to the Sub-
Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-
Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for
effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of
commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have
charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor
determines in good faith that such amount of commission is
reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and
research products and/or services provided by such broker or
dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and
research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of
either that particular transaction or the overall
responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have
with respect to the Series as well as to accounts over which
they exercise investment discretion. Not all such services or
products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series.

The Sub-Advisor may select any unaffiliated brokerage firm
unaffiliated with the Sub-Advisor consistent with Sub-Advisor's
obligation to seek best execution.  The Sub-Advisor shall not be
liable for any act or omission of any brokerage firm or firms or
counterparties designated by the Manager or chosen with
reasonable care.

(j)	Maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the
Series as are required of a sub-advisor of a registered
investment company pursuant to the 1940 Act and Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (the Investment Advisers Act), and the
rules thereunder, and furnish the Fund and the Manager with such
periodic and special reports as the Fund or Manager may
reasonably request.  In compliance with the requirements of Rule
31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Sub-Advisor hereby agrees that all
records that it maintains for the Series are the property of the
Fund, agrees to preserve for the periods described by Rule 31a-2
under the 1940 Act any records that it maintains for the Fund
and that are required to be maintained by Rule 31a-1 under the
1940 Act, and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund
any records that it maintains for the Series upon request by the
Fund or the Manager.  The Sub-Advisor shall be entitled to
retain originals or copies of records pursuant to the
requirements of applicable laws or regulations.

(k)	Observe and comply in all material respects with Rule 17j-1
under the 1940 Act and the Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics adopted
pursuant to that Rule as the same may be amended from time to
time.  The Manager acknowledges receipt of a copy of Sub-
Advisor's current Code of Ethics.  Sub-Advisor shall promptly
forward to the Manager a copy of any material amendment to the
Sub-Advisor's Code of Ethics.

(l)	From time to time as the Manager or the Fund may request,
furnish the requesting party reports on portfolio transactions
and reports on investments held by the Series, all in such
detail as the Manager or the Fund may reasonably request.  The
Sub-Advisor will make available its account management employees
to meet with the Fund's Board of Directors at the Fund's
principal place of business on due notice to review the
investments of the Series.

(m)	Provide such information as is customarily provided by a sub-
advisor and may be required for the Fund or the Manager to
comply with their respective obligations under applicable laws,
including, without limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code), the 1940 Act, the Investment
Advisers Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
Securities Act), and any state securities laws, and any rule
or regulation thereunder.  Sub-Advisor will advise Manager of
any changes in Sub-Advisor's Managing Directors within a
reasonable time after any such change.  Manager acknowledges
receipt of Sub-Advisor's Form ADV, Part 2 more than 48 hours
prior to the execution of this Agreement.

(n)	Perform quarterly and annual tax compliance tests to monitor the
Series' compliance with Subchapter M of the Code and Section
817(h) of the Code, subject to receipt of such additional
information as may be required from the Manager and provided in
accordance with Section 12(d) of this Agreement.  The
Sub-Advisor shall notify the Manager immediately upon having a
reasonable basis for believing that the Series has ceased to be
in compliance or that it might not be in compliance in the
future.  If it is determined that the Series is not in
compliance with the requirements noted above, the Sub-Advisor,
in consultation with the Manager, will take prompt action to
bring the Series back into compliance (to the extent possible)
within the time permitted under the Code.

(o)	Have the responsibility and authority to vote proxies solicited
by, or with respect to, the issuers of securities held in the
Series including the power to exercise rights, options,
warrants, conversion privileges, and redemption privileges, and
to tender securities pursuant to a tender offer.  The Manager
shall cause to be forwarded to Sub-Advisor all proxy
solicitation materials that it receives and shall assist Sub-
Advisor in its efforts to conduct the proxy voting process.

(p)	Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the Sub-
Advisor shall have no obligation to perform the following
services or to have employees of the Sub-Advisor perform the
following roles, as applicable:  (a) preparing and filing
material for distribution to shareholders of the Series,
including statistical information about the Series and material
regarding the Series' performance or investments;  (b)
providing employees of the Sub-Advisor to serve as officers of
the Fund; or (c)  providing employees of the Sub-Advisor to
serve as the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer and associated
staff.

3.	Representations and Agreements of the Manager
(i)	each Series is a qualified institutional buyer (QIB) as

agreement binding upon the Manager or the Fund;
(iv)	the assets in the Series are free from all liens and charges,
and the Manager undertakes that no liens or charges will

deposit of margin or collateral to the extent necessary to
meet the obligations of the Series with respect to any

described in the following paragraph, and multiplying this product by the
daily net assets of the Series as determined in accordance with the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information as of the close of each

"25145","Sub-Advisor in the manner the Sub-Advisor considers to be the"
"25146","most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to"
"25147","the Fund and to other clients.  The Manager recognizes that, in"
"25148","some cases, this procedure may limit the size of the position"

"25157","advantageous to the Series and at commission rates that are"

"25159","Sub-Advisor may select brokers or dealers on the basis that they"

"25161","Sub-Advisor. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the"
"25162","Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission"
"25163","for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount"
"25164","of commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would"
"25165","have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor"
"25166","determines in good faith that such amount of commission is"
"25167","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and"
"25168","research products and/or services provided by such broker or"
"25169","dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and"
"25170","research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of"
"25171","either that particular transaction or the overall"
"25172","responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have"
"25173","with respect to the Series as well as to accounts over which"
"25174","they exercise investment discretion. Not all such services or"
"25175","products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series."
"25176","In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be"
"25177","utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any"
"25178","exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all"
"25179","conditions of such order are complied with."

"25181","Series as are required of an investment advisor of a registered"

"25197","and regulation. The Manager agrees to cooperate in good faith"
"25198","with the Sub-Advisor with respect to sharing, providing copies"
"25199","or otherwise making available such records as the Sub-Advisor"
