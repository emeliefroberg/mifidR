"484","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"485","To the Board of Trustees of the Mutual Fund Series"
"486","Trust"
"487","and the Shareholders of"
"488","Camelot Premium Return Fund"
"489","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"490"," statements of the Camelot Premium Return Fund"
"491","(the Fund), a series of shares of beneficial interest"
"492"," of the Mutual Fund Series Trust, as of and for the"
"493","year ended September 30, 2012, in accordance with the"
"494"," standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"495","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"496"," Funds internal control over financial reporting,"
"497","including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"498","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"499","the"
"500","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"501","statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"502","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing"
"503","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
"504","internal"
"505","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"506","we express no such opinion."
"507","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"508"," establishing and maintaining effective internal"
"509"," control"
"510","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"511"," responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"512","management are"
"513","required to assess the expected benefits and"
"514","related costs of controls.  A companys"
"515","internal control over"
"516","financial reporting is a process designed"
"517","to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"518","the reliability of"
"519","financial reporting and the preparation of"
"520","financial statements for external purposes"
"521","in accordance with"
"522","accounting principles generally accepted in"
"523","the United States of America (GAAP)."
"524","A companys"
"525","internal control over financial reporting"
"526","includes those policies and procedures that"
"527"," (1) pertain to the"
"528","maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"529"," detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"530","transactions and"
"531","dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"532","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"533"," are"
"534","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"535","the financial statements in accordance with GAAP,"
"536"," and"
"537","that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"538","are being made only in accordance with"
"539","authorizations of"
"540","management and trustees of the company; and"
"541","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"542","prevention or"
"543","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"544","use or disposition of the companys assets"
"545","that could have a"
"546","material effect on the financial statements."
"547","Because of its inherent limitations,"
"548","internal control over financial reporting"
"549"," may not prevent or detect"
"550","misstatements.  Also, projections of any"
"551","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"552","are subject to the"
"553","risk that controls may become inadequate"
"554"," because of changes in conditions or that"
"555","the degree of"
"556","compliance with the policies or procedures"
"557","may deteriorate.  A deficiency in internal"
"558","control over financial"
"559","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"560"," of a control does not allow management or"
"561"," employees, in"
"562","the normal course of performing their"
"563","assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"564"," misstatements on a timely"
"565","basis.  A material weakness is a"
"566","deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,"
"567"," in internal control over"
"568","financial reporting, such that there"
"569","is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"570"," misstatement of the Funds"
"571","annual or interim financial statements"
"572","will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"573","basis."
"574","Our consideration of the Funds internal"
"575"," control over financial reporting was for"
"576"," the limited purpose"
"577","described in the first paragraph and"
"578","would not necessarily disclose all"
"579","deficiencies in internal control that"
"580","might be material weaknesses under"
"581","standards established by the Public"
"582","Company Accounting Oversight"
"583","Board (United States).  However,"
"584","we noted no deficiencies in the internal"
"585"," control over financial reporting"
"586","and its operations, including controls"
"587"," over safeguarding securities that we"
"588","consider to be material"
"589","weaknesses, as defined above, as of"
"590","September 30, 2012."
"591","This report is intended solely for the"
"592","information and use of management, the"
"593","shareholders of the"
"594","Camelot Premium Return Fund, the Board"
"595","of Trustees of the Mutual Fund Series"
"596","Trust, and the"
"597","Securities and Exchange Commission"
"598","and is not intended to be and should"
"599"," not be used by anyone other"
"600","than these specified parties."
