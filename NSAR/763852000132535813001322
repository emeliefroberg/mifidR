"587","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"588","To the Trustees of JPMorgan Trust II and the Shareholders of JPMorgan U.S. Real Estate Fund:"
"589","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of JPMorgan U.S. Real Estate Fund"
"590","(a separate Fund of JPMorgan Trust II) (hereafter referred to as the Trust) as of and for the year"
"591","ended December 31, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"592","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust's internal control over financial reporting,"
"593","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"594","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"595","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness"
"596","of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"597","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"598","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"599","over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"600","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"601","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"602","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"603","generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"604","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"605","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"606","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"607","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"608","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"609","trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"610","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"611","financial statements."
"612","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"613","misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"614","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"615","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"616","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control"
"617","does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"618","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"619","or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"620","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Trust's annual or interim financial statements"
"621","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"622","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"623","described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"624","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"625","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"626","Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"627","securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined above as of December 31, 2012."
"628","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Trustees of"
"629","JPMorgan Trust II and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should"
"630","not be used by anyone other than these specified parties."

"1072","statutory trust (Trust). In the event of any inconsistency between the terms hereof and the terms"
"1073","of the Declaration of Trust, the terms of the Declaration of Trust shall control."
"1074","       Section 2.  Definitions.  Capitalized terms used herein and not herein defined are used as"
"1075","defined in the Declaration of Trust."
"1076","ARTICLE II - OFFICES"
"1077","       Section 1.  Principal Office.  The principal executive office of the Trust shall be 270 Park"
"1078","Avenue, New York, New York until such time as the Trustees may change the location of the"
"1079","principal executive office of the Trust to any other place within or outside the State of Delaware."
"1080","       Section 2.  Delaware Office.  The Trustees shall establish a registered office in the State of"
"1081","Delaware and shall appoint as the Trust's registered agent for service of process in the State of"

"1084","office of such registered agent for service of process shall be identical with the registered Delaware"
"1085","office of the Trust. The Trustees may designate a successor resident agent, provided, however, that"
"1086","such appointment shall not become effective until written notice thereof is delivered to the Office"
"1087","of the Secretary of the State of Delaware."
"1088","       Section 3. Other Offices. The Trustees may at any time establish branch or subordinate"

"1094","held at the principal executive office of the Trust."
"1095","       Section 2.  Call of Meetings.  There shall be no annual Shareholders' meetings except as"
"1096","required by law. Special meetings of the Shareholders of the Trust or of any Series or. Class may be"

"1098","action upon any matter requiring the vote or authority of the Shareholders of the Trust or of any"
"1099","Series or Class as herein provided or provided in the Declaration of Trust or upon any other matter"
"1100","as to which such vote or authority is deemed by the Trustees or the President to be necessary or"
"1101","desirable.  Meetings of the Shareholders of the Trust or of any Series or Class may be called for"
"1102","any purpose deemed necessary or desirable upon the written request of the Shareholders holding at"

"1109","of the Secretary, call the meeting by giving the required notice.)  If the meeting is a meeting of"

"1116","specify (i) the place, date and hour of the meeting, and (ii) the general nature of the business to be"
"1117","transacted."
"1118","       Section 4.  Manner of Giving Notice; Affidavit of Notice.  Notice of any meeting of"

"1214","between the earliest date on which a record date for such meeting could be set in accordance"
"1215","herewith and the date of such meeting. If the Trustees do not so fix a record date or close the"
"1216","register or transfer books of the affected Series or Classes, the record date for determining"
"1217","Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders shall be the close of"
"1218","business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is"
"1219","waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is"

"1227","Trustees, the record date shall be the close of business on the day on which the Trustees adopt the"
"1228","resolution relating to that action."
"1229","       (c) Nothing in this Section shall be construed as precluding the Trustees from setting"
"1230","different record dates for different Series or Classes. Only Shareholders of record on the record"
"1231","date, as herein determined, shall have any right to vote or to act at any meeting or give consent to"
"1232","any action relating to such record date, notwithstanding any transfer of Shares on the books of the"
"1233","Trust after such record date."
"1234","       Section 11. Proxies. Subject to the provisions of the Declaration of Trust, Shareholders"
"1235","entitled to vote for Trustees or on any other matter shall have the right to do so either in person or"

"1241","eleven (11) months before the meeting.  A proxy shall be deemed executed by a Shareholder if the"
"1242","Shareholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic"
"1243","transmission or otherwise) by the Shareholder or the Shareholder's attorney-in-fact. A valid proxy"
"1244","which does not state that it is irrevocable shall continue in full force and effect unless (i) revoked"
"1245","by the Person executing it before the vote pursuant to that proxy is taken, (a) by a writing delivered"
"1246","to the Trust stating that the proxy is revoked, or (b) by a subsequent proxy executed by such"
"1247","Person, or (c) attendance at the meeting and voting in person by the Person executing that proxy, or"
"1248","(d) revocation by such Person using any electronic, telephonic, computerized or other alternative"

"1250","or incapacity of the ,maker of that proxy is received by the Trust before the vote pursuant to that"
"1251","proxy is counted. A proxy with respect to Shares held in the name of two or more Persons shall be"
"1252","valid if executed by any one of them unless at or prior to exercise of the proxy the Trust receives a"
"1253","specific written notice to the contrary from anyone of the two or more Persons. A proxy purporting"
"1254","to be executed by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior"
"1255","to its exercise and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. Unless otherwise"
"1256","specifically limited by their terms, proxies shall entitle the Shareholder to vote at any adjournment"
"1257","or postponement of a Shareholders' meeting. At every meeting of Shareholders, unless the voting is"
"1258","conducted by inspectors, all questions concerning the qualifications of voters, the validity of"
"1259","proxies, and the acceptance or rejection of votes, shall be decided by the chairman of the meeting."
"1260","Subject to the provisions of the Declaration of Trust or these By-Laws, all matters concerning the"
"1261","giving, voting or validity of proxies shall be governed by the General Corporation Law of the State"

"1268","fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the chairman of the meeting may appoint a person to fill the"
"1269","vacancy."
"1270","       These inspectors shall:"
"1271","(a)	Determine the number of Shares outstanding and the voting power of each (and, to the"
"1272","extent that voting power is determined by Net Asset Value, the inspectors shall rely"

"1274","Share), the Shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the"
"1275","authenticity, validity and effect of proxies;"
