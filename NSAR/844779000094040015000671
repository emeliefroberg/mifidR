"8104","accounting services provider and other service providers"
"8105","(collectively, Other Service Providers)) for the Fund and each"
"8106","Portfolio.  Adviser further agrees that it:"
"8107","   a. will comply with (i) the provisions of the 1940 Act and"
"8108","the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and all"
"8109","applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, (ii) any other"
"8110","applicable provision of law and (iii) the provisions of"
"8111","this Agreement, the Declaration of Trust and the Amended"
"8112","and Restated Code of Regulations of the Fund as such are"
"8113","amended from time to time;"
"8114","   b. will place orders either directly with the issuer or"
"8115","with any broker or dealer.  Subject to the other provisions"
"8116","of this paragraph, in placing orders with brokers and"
"8117","dealers, Adviser will attempt to obtain the best price and"
"8118","the most favorable execution of its orders.  In placing"
"8119","orders, Adviser will consider the experience and skill of"
"8120","the firm's securities traders as well as the firm's"
"8121","financial responsibility and administrative efficiency."
"8122","Consistent with this obligation, Adviser may, subject to"
"8123","the approval of the Board, select brokers on the basis of"
"8124","the research, statistical and pricing services they provide"
"8125","to a Portfolio and other clients of Adviser or a sub-"
"8126","adviser.  Information and research received from such"
"8127","brokers will be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the"
"8128","services required to be performed by Adviser hereunder.  A"
"8129","commission paid to such brokers may be higher than that"
"8130","which another qualified broker would have charged for"
"8131","effecting the same transaction, provided that Adviser"
"8132","determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable"
"8133","in terms of either the transaction or the overall"
"8134","responsibility of Adviser and sub-advisers to the"
"8135","Portfolios and their other clients and that the total"
"8136","commissions paid by each Portfolio will be reasonable in"
"8137","relation to the benefits to such Portfolio over the long-"
"8138","term.  In no instance, however, will a Portfolio's"
"8139","securities be purchased from or sold to Adviser, the sub-"
"8140","advisers, the Fund's distributor or any affiliated person"
"8141","thereof, except to the extent permitted by the SEC or by"
"8142","applicable law.  Subject to the foregoing and the"
"8143","provisions of the 1940 Act, the Securities Exchange Act of"
"8144","1934, as amended, and other applicable provisions of law,"
"8145","Adviser may select brokers and dealers with which it or the"
"8146","Fund is affiliated;"
"8147","   c. will maintain books and records with respect to each"
"8148","Portfolio's securities transactions and will furnish the"
"8149","Board such periodic and special reports as the Board may"
"8150","request;"
"8151","   d. will maintain a policy and practice of conducting its"
"8152","investment advisory services hereunder independently of the"
"8153","commercial banking operations of its affiliates.  When"
"8154","Adviser makes investment recommendations for a Portfolio,"
"8155","its investment advisory personnel will not inquire or take"
"8156","into consideration whether the issuer of securities"
"8157","proposed for purchase or sale for the Portfolio's account"
"8158","are customers of the commercial departments of its"
"8159","affiliates.  In dealing with commercial customers of its"
"8160","affiliates, Adviser and the sub-advisers will not inquire"
"8161","or take into consideration whether securities of those"
"8162","customers are held by the Fund;"
"8163","   e. will treat confidentially and as proprietary"
"8164","information of the Fund all records and other information"
"8165","relative to the Fund, any of the Portfolio's and the Fund's"
"8166","prior, current or potential shareholders, and will not use"
"8167","such records, and information for any purpose other than"
"8168","performance of its responsibilities and duties hereunder,"

"8357","      8. Compensation."
"8358","         a. For the services provided and the expenses assumed"

"8374","such excess otherwise payable to it hereunder.  The obligation"
"8375","of Adviser to reimburse the Fund under this Paragraph 8(b) is"
"8376","limited in any fiscal year to the amount of its fees otherwise"
"8377","payable hereunder attributable to the Portfolios for such fiscal"
"8378","year, provided; however, that notwithstanding the foregoing,"
"8379","Adviser shall reimburse the Fund for the full amount of any such"
"8380","excess expenses regardless of the amount of fees otherwise"
"8381","payable to it during such fiscal year to the extent that the"
"8382","securities regulations of any state having jurisdiction over the"
"8383","Fund so require.  Such expense reimbursement, if any, will be"
"8384","estimated, reconciled and paid on a monthly basis."
"8385","         c. For purposes of the fee rates set forth on Appendix A,"
"8386","the net assets of the Portfolios shall be calculated pursuant to"
"8387","the procedures adopted by resolutions of the Board for"
"8388","calculating the value of the Fund's assets or delegating such"
"8389","calculations to third parties."
"8390","      9. Limitation of Liability.  Adviser shall not be liable for"
"8391","any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered"
"8392","by the Fund in connection with the performance of this"
"8393","Agreement, except a loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary"
"8394","duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services or"
"8395","a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross"
"8396","negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or from"
"8397","reckless disregard by it of its obligations or duties under this"
"8398","Agreement."
"8399","      10. Duration and Termination.  This Agreement will become"
"8400","effective as of the date hereof with respect to each Portfolio"
"8401","listed on Appendix A and, with respect to any additional"
"8402","Portfolio, on the date of receipt by the Fund of notice from"
"8403","Adviser in accordance with Section 1(b) hereof that Adviser is"
"8404","willing to serve as investment adviser with respect to such"
"8405","Portfolio, provided that this Agreement (as supplemented by the"
"8406","terms specified in any notice and agreement pursuant to"
"8407","Section 1(b) hereof) shall have been approved in accordance with"
"8408","the requirements of the 1940 Act, and, unless sooner terminated"
"8409","as provided herein, shall continue in effect with respect to"
"8410","each such Portfolio for two years.  Thereafter, if not"

"8413","provided such continuance is specifically approved at least"
"8414","annually (a) by vote of a majority of those members of the Board"
"8415","who are not interested persons of any party to this Agreement,"
"8416","cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on"
"8417","such approval, and (b) by the Board or by vote of a majority of"
"8418","the outstanding voting securities of such Portfolio."
"8419","Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated"
"8420","with respect to any Portfolio at any time, without the payment"
"8421","of any penalty, by the Fund (by vote of the Board or by vote of"
"8422","a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the"
"8423","Portfolio), or by Adviser on sixty days' written notice.  This"
"8424","Agreement will immediately terminate in the event of its"
"8425","assignment.  (As used in this Agreement, the terms majority of
the outstanding voting securities, interested persons and"
"8426","assignment shall have the same meanings as such terms in the"
"8427","1940 Act.)"

"8435","Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated"
"8436","orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party"

"8446","use by the Fund of the name or identifying word BlackRock in"
"8447","the name of the Fund and the Portfolios.  Such consent is"
"8448","conditioned upon the employment of Adviser as the investment"
