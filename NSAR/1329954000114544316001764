"1678","<P style=margin:0px; font-family:Georgia>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of John Hancock Funds III"
"1679","(the &#147;Funds&#148;) as of and for the year ended February 29, 2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1680","considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose"

"1686","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. &nbsp;A fund&#146;s internal"
"1687","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements"
"1688","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. &nbsp;A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"1689","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide"
"1690","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"

"1695","<P style=margin:0px; font-family:Georgia>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. &nbsp;Also,"

"1701","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim"
