"4229","MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT"
"4230","EnTrustPermal Management LLC"
"4231","     This MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (Agreement) is made this      day"
"4232","of             , 2016, by and between Legg Mason Partners Equity Trust (the"
"4233","Trust) and EnTrustPermal Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability"
"4234","company (the Manager)."
"4235","     WHEREAS, the Trust is a Maryland statutory trust registered as a"
"4236","management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as"
"4237","amended (the 1940 Act);"
"4238","     WHEREAS, the Manager is engaged primarily in rendering investment"
"4239","advisory and management services and is registered as an investment adviser"
"4240","under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act);"
"4241","     WHEREAS, the Trust wishes to retain the Manager to provide trading,"
"4242","investment advisory and management services to the Trust with respect to the"
"4243","series of the Trust designated in Schedule A annexed hereto (the Fund); and"
"4244","     WHEREAS, the Manager is willing to furnish such services on the terms and"
"4245","conditions hereinafter set forth;"
"4246","     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual covenants"
"4247","herein contained, it is agreed as follows:"
"4248","     1. The Trust hereby appoints the Manager to act as investment adviser of"
"4249","the Fund for the period and on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The"
"4250","Manager accepts such appointment and agrees to render the services herein set"
"4251","forth, for the compensation herein provided."
"4252","     2. The Fund shall at all times keep the Manager fully informed with"
"4253","regard to the securities, Commodity Interests (as defined in paragraph 3) and"
"4254","other investments owned by it, its funds available, or to become available,"
"4255","for investment, and generally as to the condition of its affairs. It shall"
"4256","furnish the Manager with such other documents and information with regard to"
"4257","its affairs as the Manager may from time to time reasonably request."
"4258","     3. (a) Subject to the supervision of the Trust's Board of Trustees (the"
"4259","Board), the Manager shall regularly provide the Fund with investment"
"4260","research, advice, management and supervision and shall furnish a continuous"
"4261","investment program for the Fund's portfolio of securities, Commodity"
"4262","Interests and other investments consistent with the Fund's investment"
"4263","objectives, policies and restrictions, as stated in the Fund's current"
"4264","Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information. For purposes of this"
"4265","Agreement, Commodity Interests include commodity futures (including futures"
"4266","on broad-based securities indexes or interest rate futures), forward"
"4267","contracts, foreign exchange transactions, options on commodity futures,"
"4268","swaps, swaptions and certain other instruments regulated by the Commodity"
"4269","Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC). The Manager shall determine from"
"4270","time to time what securities, Commodity Interests and other investments will"
"4271","be purchased, retained, sold or exchanged by the Fund and what portion of the"
"4272","assets of the Fund's portfolio will be held in the various securities,"
"4273","Commodity Interests and other investments in which the Fund invests, and"
"4274","shall implement those decisions (including the execution of investment"
"4275","documentation), all subject to the provisions of the Trust's Declaration of"
"4276","Trust and By-Laws (collectively, the Governing Documents), the"
"4277","1940 Act, the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the CEA) and the"
"4278","applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange"
"4279","Commission (the SEC) and the CFTC and interpretive guidance issued by the"
"4280","SEC staff and the CFTC staff, any exemptive orders or other relief issued by"
"4281","the SEC or the CFTC applicable to the Fund, any other applicable federal and"
"4282","state law, the investment objectives, policies and restrictions of the Fund"
"4283","referred to above, and any other specific policies adopted by the Board and"
"4284","disclosed to the Manager. The Manager is authorized as the agent of the Trust"
"4285","to give instructions to the custodian of the Fund (the Custodian) and any"
"4286","Fund sub-custodian or prime broker as to deliveries of securities, Commodity"
"4287","Interests and other investments and payments of cash in respect of"
"4288","transactions or cash margin calls for the account of the Fund. Subject to"
"4289","applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and direction from the Board, the"
"4290","investment program to be provided hereunder may entail the investment of all"
"4291","or substantially all of the assets of the Fund in one or more investment"
"4292","companies. To the extent not delegated to a subadviser, commodity trading"
"4293","advisor (CTA) or commodity pool operator (CPO), the Manager will place"
"4294","orders pursuant to its investment determinations for the Fund either directly"
"4295","with the issuer or with any broker or dealer, foreign currency dealer,"
"4296","futures commission merchant, counterparty or others selected by it. In"
"4297","connection with the selection of such brokers or dealers and the placing of"
"4298","such orders, subject to applicable law, brokers or dealers may be selected"
"4299","who also provide brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined"
"4300","in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the"
"4301","Exchange Act)) to the Fund and/or the other accounts over which the Manager"
"4302","or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The Manager is authorized"
"4303","to pay a broker or dealer who provides such brokerage and research services a"
"4304","commission for executing a portfolio transaction for the Fund, which is in"
"4305","excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have"
"4306","charged for effecting that transaction, if the Manager determines in good"
"4307","faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value"
"4308","of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer."
"4309","This determination may be viewed in terms of either that particular"
"4310","transaction or the overall responsibilities that the Manager and its"
"4311","affiliates have with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment"
"4312","discretion. The Board may adopt policies and procedures that modify and"
"4313","restrict the Manager's authority regarding the execution of the Fund's"
"4314","portfolio transactions provided herein. The Manager shall also provide advice"
"4315","and recommendations with respect to other aspects of the business and affairs"
"4316","of the Fund, shall exercise voting rights, rights to consent to corporate"
"4317","action and any other rights pertaining to the Fund's portfolio securities"
"4318","subject to such direction as the Board may provide, and shall perform such"
"4319","other functions of investment management and supervision as may be directed"
"4320","by the Board. The Manager may execute on behalf of the Fund certain"
"4321","agreements, instruments and documents in connection with the services"
"4322","performed by it under this Agreement. These may include, without limitation,"
"4323","brokerage agreements, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements,"
"4324","clearing agreements, account documentation, futures and option agreements,"
"4325","swap agreements, limited partnership agreements, derivative master"
"4326","agreements, other investment-related agreements, and any other agreements,"
"4327","documents, schedules, annexes, instruments, releases, consents, elections and"
"4328","confirmations the Manager believes are appropriate or desirable in performing"
"4329","its duties under this Agreement."
"4330","     (b) Subject to the direction and control of the Board, the Manager shall"
"4331","perform such management services as may from time to time be reasonably"
"4332","requested by the Fund as necessary for the provision of investment and"
"4333","trading advisory and related services to the Fund, such as (i) oversight of"
"4334","the Fund's subadvisers, CTAs and CPOs; (ii) providing certain"
"4335","2"
"4336","compliance and regulatory reporting services, and (iii) providing assistance"
"4337","with the preparation of Board materials, registration statements, proxy"
"4338","statements and reports and other communications to shareholders."
"4339","Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Manager shall not be deemed to have"
"4340","assumed any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the"
"4341","distribution of the shares of the Fund, nor shall the Manager be deemed to"
"4342","have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions"
"4343","specifically assumed by the Custodian or any transfer agent, fund accounting"
"4344","agent, fund administrator, shareholder servicing agent or other agent, in"
"4345","each case employed by the Fund to perform such functions."
"4346","     (c) The Fund hereby authorizes any entity or person associated with the"
"4347","Manager, which is a member of a national securities exchange, to effect any"
"4348","transaction on the exchange for the account of the Fund which is permitted by"
"4349","Section 11(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder, and the Fund"
"4350","hereby consents to the retention of compensation for such transactions in"
"4351","accordance with Rule 11a2-2(T)(a)(2)(iv). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the"
"4352","Manager agrees that it will not deal with itself, or with members of the"
"4353","Board or any principal underwriter of the Fund, as principals or agents in"
"4354","making purchases or sales of securities or other property for the account of"
"4355","the Fund, nor will it purchase any securities from an underwriting or selling"
"4356","group in which the Manager or its affiliates is participating, or arrange for"
"4357","purchases and sales of securities between the Fund and another account"
"4358","advised by the Manager or its affiliates, except in each case as permitted by"
"4359","the 1940 Act and in accordance with such policies and procedures as may be"
"4360","adopted by the Fund from time to time, and will comply with all other"
"4361","provisions of the Governing Documents and the Fund's then-current Prospectus"
"4362","and Statement of Additional Information relative to the Manager and its"
"4363","directors and officers."
"4364","     (d) The Fund may establish one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries of the"
"4365","Fund through which it may conduct a significant portion of its investments in"
"4366","Commodity Interests."
"4367","     (e) When the Fund adopts policies, procedures or restrictions to the"
"4368","Governing Documents, and amendments or revisions thereto, the Fund will"
"4369","provide the documents to the Manager in advance of their implementation."
"4370","     4. Subject to the Board's approval and consistent with the 1940 Act and"
"4371","any SEC exemptive relief or guidance thereunder, the Manager or the Fund may"
"4372","enter into, or terminate, contracts with one or more subadvisers, CTAs or"
"4373","CPOs, including without limitation, affiliates of the Manager, in which the"
"4374","Manager delegates to such subadvisers, CTAs or CPOs any or all its duties"
"4375","specified hereunder, on such terms as the Manager will determine to be"
"4376","necessary, desirable or appropriate, provided that in each case the Manager"
"4377","shall supervise the activities of each such subadviser, CTA or CPO and"
"4378","further provided that such contracts impose on any subadviser, CTA or CPO"
"4379","bound thereby all the conditions to which the Manager is subject hereunder"
"4380","and that such contracts are entered into in accordance with and meet all"
"4381","applicable requirements of the 1940 Act and the CEA. The Manager shall have"
"4382","the authority to allocate all or a portion of the Fund's assets for portfolio"
"4383","management purposes among subadvisers, CTAs and CPOs."
"4384","     5. (a) The Manager, at its expense, shall supply the Board and officers"
"4385","of the Trust with all information and reports reasonably required by them and"
"4386","reasonably available to the Manager and, to the extent not provided by other"
"4387","parties, shall furnish the Fund with office facilities, including space,"
"4388","furniture and equipment and all personnel reasonably necessary for the"
"4389","3"
"4390","operation of the Fund. With respect to the Fund's transactions in securities,"
"4391","Commodity Interests and other investments, the Manager shall oversee the"
"4392","maintenance of all books and records in accordance with all applicable"
"4393","federal and state laws and regulations, except to the extent arrangements"
"4394","have been made for such books and records to be maintained by any fund"
"4395","administrator or other agent of the Fund. In compliance with the requirements"
"4396","of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, the Manager hereby agrees that any records"
"4397","that it maintains for the Fund are the property of the Fund, and further"
"4398","agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any of such records upon the Fund's"
"4399","request. The Manager further agrees to arrange for the preservation of the"
"4400","records required to be maintained hereunder in accordance with all applicable"
"4401","laws and resolutions, including compliance with the requirements of Rules"
"4402","31a-1 and 31a-2 under the 1940 Act and CFTC Rule 4.23. The Manager shall"
"4403","authorize and permit any of its directors, officers and employees, who may be"

"4405","in which they are elected."
"4406","     (b) The Manager shall bear all expenses, and shall furnish all necessary"
"4407","services, facilities and personnel, in connection with its responsibilities"

"4438","the Fund is a party and the legal obligation which the Fund may have to"
"4439","indemnify the Fund's Board members and officers with respect thereto."
"4440","     6. The Manager may delegate some or all of its duties under this"
"4441","Agreement to affiliated investment advisers or other service providers (each"
"4442","a Manager-Delegatee); provided, however, that (i) the Manager provides"
"4443","prior written notice to the Fund and the Fund consents in writing, (ii) any"
"4444","delegation of advisory duties is subject to and conditioned on the approval"
"4445","of the"
"4446","4"
"4447","Board and/or the Fund's shareholders as may be required pursuant to Section"
"4448","15 of the 1940 Act, (iii) any such delegation complies with applicable"
"4449","exemptive relief, rule or no-action position on which the Fund relies; (iv)"
"4450","no additional charges, fees or other compensation will be paid by the Fund"
"4451","for such services, (v) the Manager hereby agrees to advise the Fund of any"
"4452","changes required to be made to the disclosure in the Fund's registration"
"4453","statement relating to the Fund's portfolio managers provided by the Manager"
"4454","or any Manager-Delegatee, and (vi) the Manager at all times remains liable to"
"4455","the Fund for its obligations hereunder regardless of whether services"
"4456","hereunder are provided by the Manager or any Manager-Delegatee. To the extent"
"4457","that such delegation occurs, references to the Manager herein also shall be"
"4458","deemed to include reference to any Manager-Delegatee, as the context may"
"4459","require."
"4460","     7. No member of the Board, officer or employee of the Trust or Fund shall"
"4461","receive from the Trust or Fund any salary or other compensation as such"
"4462","member of the Board, officer or employee while he is at the same time a"
"4463","director, officer, or employee of the Manager or any affiliated company of"
"4464","the Manager, except as the Board may decide. This paragraph shall not apply"
"4465","to Board members, executive committee members, consultants and other persons"
"4466","who are not regular members of the Manager's or any affiliated company's"
"4467","staff."
"4468","     8. As compensation for the services performed and the expenses assumed by"
"4469","the Manager, the Fund shall pay the Manager, within five (5) days after the"
"4470","last day of each month, a fee, computed daily at an annual rate set forth on"
"4471","Schedule A annexed hereto. The first payment of the fee shall be made within"
"4472","five (5) days after the end of the month succeeding the effective date of"
"4473","this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated as of any date not the last"
"4474","day of a month, such fee shall be paid within five (5) days after the end of"
"4475","the month of termination and shall be pro rated based upon the number of days"
"4476","in such month for which this Agreement was effective bears to the total"
"4477","number of days in such month; provided, however, that if the Fund invests all"
"4478","or substantially all of its assets in another registered investment company"
"4479","for which the Manager or an affiliate of the Manager serves as investment"
"4480","adviser or investment manager, the annual fee computed as set forth on such"
"4481","Schedule A shall be reduced by the aggregate management fees allocated to"
"4482","that Fund for the Fund's then-current fiscal year from such other registered"
"4483","investment company. The average daily net assets of the Fund shall in all"
"4484","cases be based only on business days and be computed as of the time of the"
"4485","regular close of business of the New York Stock Exchange, or such other time"

"4709","managing any collateral and margin requirements required by applicable"
"4710","counterparties and associated with investments made for the Allocated"
"4711","Portion, if any, and will perform reconciliation procedures on such custodial"
"4712","accounts with respect to the Allocated Portion in accordance with the"
"4713","Custodian's standard practices, and provide information regarding such"
"4714","reconciliations to the Manager upon request in a form to be agreed between"

"4718","the Manager except as expressly authorized in this Agreement or another"
"4719","writing by the Trust, the Manager and the Trader. The Trust may, from time to"
"4720","time, provide Board resolutions to the Trader related to the foregoing."

"4724","entities, it will use its best efforts to achieve an equitable treatment of"
"4725","all accounts and will use a fair and reasonable system of order entry for all"
"4726","accounts, taking into consideration any legal and regulatory limitations"
"4727","applicable to the Fund, in addition to the Trader's policies and procedures"
"4728","and the Fund's or Manager's policies, procedures and instructions. The Trader"
"4729","further agrees to be aware of the position limits imposed on certain"
"4730","Commodity Interest contracts by the CFTC or applicable contract market. If,"
"4731","at any time during the term of this Agreement, the Trader is required to"
"4732","aggregate the Fund's Commodity Interest positions with the positions of any"
"4733","other person for the purposes of applying the CFTC or exchange imposed"
"4734","speculative position limits, the Trader will promptly notify the Manager if"
"4735","the Allocated Portion positions are included in an aggregate amount which"
"4736","exceeds the applicable speculative position limit. If the speculative"
"4737","position limits are reached in any Commodity Interest contract, the Trader"
"4738","will modify the trading instructions to the Fund's account and its other"
"4739","accounts in a reasonable and good faith effort to achieve an equitable"
"4740","treatment of all accounts."
"4741","          (c) The Trader acknowledges that the Fund may establish one or more"
"4742","wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Fund through which it may conduct all or a"
"4743","significant portion of its commodities investing activities or for other"
"4744","investment purposes."
"4745","          (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is"
"4746","agreed that the Trader shall have no responsibility for: (a) monitoring any"
"4747","limitations or restrictions in respect of the Fund as a whole (it being"
"4748","agreed that all such monitoring shall be the responsibility of the Manager);"
"4749","or (b) the segregation requirement of the 1940 Act or other applicable law of"

"4752","Portion only, the Trader shall (i) conduct its trading activities in a manner"
"4753","consistent with the segregation and coverage requirements of the 1940 Act and"
"4754","the CEA or any instructions, restrictions or policies of the Manager in"
"4755","relation thereto (as described above) and (ii) share with the Manager, upon"
"4756","request, such information as the Manager shall require to demonstrate"
"4757","compliance with item (i) above and shall provide assistance upon request to"
"4758","the Manager in identifying assets to address segregation requirements. For"
"4759","the avoidance of doubt, the Trader shall not be required to provide"
"4760","instructions for any physical segregation of assets related to Section 18 of"
"4761","the 1940 Act to the Custodian."
"4762","          (e) When the Manager provides policies, procedures, restrictions or"
"4763","Governing Documents, or amendments or revisions thereto, to the Trader that"
