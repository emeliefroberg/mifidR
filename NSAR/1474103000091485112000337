"523","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"524","Accounting Firm"
"525","To the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Global"
"526","Asset Management Trust and Shareholders of"
"527","Legg Mason BW Diversified Large Cap Value"
"528","Fund:"
"529","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"530","financial statements of Legg Mason BW"
"531","Diversified Large Cap Value Fund (one of the"
"532","funds comprising Legg Mason Global Asset"
"533","Management Trust, the Company) as of and"
"534","for the year ended September 30, 2012, in"
"535","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"536","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"537","States), we considered the Company?s internal"
"538","control over financial reporting, including"
"539","controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"540","basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"541","the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"542","financial statements and to comply with the"
"543","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"544","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"545","effectiveness of the Company?s internal control"
"546","over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not"
"547","express an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"548","Company's internal control over financial"
"549","reporting."
"550","The management of the Company is"
"551","responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"552","effective internal control over financial reporting."
"553","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"554","judgments by management are required to"
"555","assess the expected benefits and related"
"556","costs of controls.  A company?s internal control"
"557","over financial reporting is a process designed"
"558","to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"559","reliability of financial reporting and the"
"560","preparation of financial statements for external"
"561","purposes in accordance with generally"
"562","accepted accounting principles.  A company's"
"563","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"564","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"565","to the maintenance of records that, in"
"566","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"567","the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"568","of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"569","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"570","necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"571","statements in accordance with generally"
"572","accepted accounting principles, and that"
"573","receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"574","being made only in accordance with"
"575","authorizations of management and trustees of"
"576","the company; and (3)  provide reasonable"
"577","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"578","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"579","disposition of a company?s assets that could"
"580","have a material effect on the financial"
"581","statements."
"582","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"583","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"584","or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"585","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"586","are subject to the risk that controls may"
"587","become inadequate because of changes in"
"588","conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"589","with the policies or procedures may"
"590","deteriorate."
"591","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"592","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"593","a control does not allow management or"
"594","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"595","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"596","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"597","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"598","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"599","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"600","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"601","Company's annual or interim financial"
"602","statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"603","a timely basis."
"604","Our consideration of the Company?s internal"
"605","control over financial reporting was for the"
"606","limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"607","and would not necessarily disclose all"
"608","deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"609","reporting that might be material weaknesses"
"610","under standards established by the Public"
"611","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"612","States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in"
"613","the Company?s internal control over financial"
"614","reporting and its operation, including controls"
"615","over safeguarding securities that we consider"
"616","to be material weaknesses as defined above as"
"617","of September 30, 2012."
"618","This report is intended solely for the information"
"619","and use of management and the Board of"
"620","Trustees of Legg Mason Global Asset"
"621","Management Trust and the Securities and"
"622","Exchange Commission and is not intended to"
"623","be and should not be used by anyone other"
"624","than these specified parties."

"658","speaking, the larger the size of your investment"
"659","and the longer your investment horizon, the more"
"660","likely it will be that Class C shares will not be as"
"661","advantageous as Class A shares. The annual"
"662","distribution and/or service fees on Class C shares"
"663","may cost you more over the longer term than the"
"664","front-end sales charge and service fees you would"
"665","have paid for larger purchases of Class A shares."
"666","If you are eligible to purchase Class I shares, you"
"667","should be aware that Class I shares are not"

"739","Certain retirement plan programs with exchange"
"740","features in effect prior to November 20, 2006"
"741","(collectively, the ?Grandfathered Retirement"
"742","Program?), that are authorized by the distributor"
"743","to offer eligible retirement plan investors the"
"744","opportunity to exchange all of their Class C"
"745","shares for Class A shares of an applicable fund"
"746","sold by the distributor, are permitted to maintain"
"747","such share class exchange feature for current"
"748","and prospective retirement plan investors. Under"
"749","the Grandfathered Retirement Program, Class C"
"750","shares of a fund may be purchased by plans"
"751","investing less than $3 million. Class C shares are"
"752","eligible for exchange into Class A shares not later"
"753","than eight years after the plan joins the program."
"754","They are eligible for exchange in the following"
"755","circumstances:"
"756","If a participating plan?s total Class C holdings in"
"757","all non-money market funds sold by the"
"758","distributor equal at least $3,000,000 at the end of"
"759","the fifth year after the date the participating plan"
"760","enrolled in the Grandfathered Retirement"
"761","Program, the participating plan will be offered the"
"762","opportunity to exchange all of its Class C shares"
"763","for Class A shares of the fund. Such participating"
"764","plans will be notified of the pending exchange in"
"765","writing within 30 days after the fifth anniversary of"
"766","the enrollment date and, unless the exchange"
"767","offer has been rejected in writing, the exchange"
"768","will occur on or about the 90th day after the fifth"
"769","anniversary date. If the participating plan does not"
"770","qualify for the five-year exchange to Class A"
"771","shares, a review of the participating plan?s"
"772","holdings will be performed each quarter until"
"773","either the participating plan qualifies or the end of"
"774","the eighth year."
"775","Any participating plan that has not previously"
"776","qualified for an exchange into Class A shares will"
"777","be offered the opportunity to exchange all of its"
"778","Class C shares for Class A shares of the same"
"779","fund regardless of asset size at the end of the"
"780","eighth year after the date the participating plan"
"781","enrolled in the Grandfathered Retirement"
"782","Program. Such plans will be notified of the"
"783","pending exchange in writing approximately 60"
"784","days before the eighth anniversary of the"
"785","enrollment date and, unless the exchange has"
"786","been rejected in writing, the exchange will occur"
"787","on or about the eighth anniversary date. Once an"
"788","exchange has occurred, a participating plan will"
"789","not be eligible to acquire additional Class C"
"790","shares, but instead may acquire Class A shares"
"791","of the same fund. Any Class C shares not"
"792","converted will continue to be subject to the"
