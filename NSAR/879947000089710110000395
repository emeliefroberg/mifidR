"2045","<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;'><font face=Arial,sans-serif lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;'>The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessar"
"2046","y to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</font></p>"

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</font></p>"

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,&#160; in internal control over financial reporting, such that&#160; there is a&#160; reasonable&#160; possibility&#160; that a material&#160; misstatement&#160; of the Trust&#8217;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</font></p>"
