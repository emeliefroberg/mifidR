"5960","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"5961","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees"
"5962","of Touchstone Funds Group Trust"
"5963","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"5964","statements of Touchstone Funds Group Trust (the Trust)"
"5965","as of and for the year ended September 30, 2012, in"
"5966","accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"5967","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"5968","the company's internal control over financial reporting,"
"5969","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"5970","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"5971","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"5972","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"
"5973","SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"5974","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over"
"5975","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"5976","opinion."
"5977","The management of the Trust is responsible for"
"5978","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"5979","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"5980","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"5981","required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"5982","costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"5983","financial reporting is a process designed to provide"
"5984","reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"5985","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"5986","statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"5987","generally accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"5988","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"5989","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"5990","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"5991","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"
"5992","dispositions of the assets of the trust; (2) provide"
"5993","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"5994","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements"
"5995","in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"5996","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"5997","company are being made only in accordance with"
"5998","authorizations of management and trustees of the trust;"
"5999","and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"6000","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"6001","disposition of the company's assets that could have a"
"6002","material effect on the financial statements."
"6003","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control"
"6004","over financial reporting may not prevent or detect"
"6005","misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"6006","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"6007","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"6008","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the"
"6009","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"6010","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"6011","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"6012","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"6013","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"6014","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"6015","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"6016","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"6017","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of"
"6018","the company's annual or interim financial statements will"
"6019","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"6020","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over"
"6021","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described"
"6022","in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose"
"6023","all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"6024","material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"6025","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"6026","States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"6027","company's internal control over financial reporting and"
"6028","its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"6029","securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as"
"6030","defined above as of September 30, 2012."
"6031","This report is intended solely for the information and"
"6032","use of management and the Board of Trustees of the Trust"
"6033","and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"6034","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other"
"6035","than these specified parties."

"6047","On April 16, 2012, the Registrant acquired substantially all"
"6048","of the assets and liabilities of the OM Barrow Hanley Core"
"6049","Bond Portfolio and OM Dwight Short Term Bond Portfolio, each"
"6050","an investment portfolio of Old Mutual Funds II (the OM
Funds), another registered open-end investment company,"
"6051","pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated"
"6052","October 4, 2011 (the Agreement)  and approved by the"
"6053","shareholders of the OM Funds  (the Reorganizations).  The"
"6054","Reorganizations were accomplished through a tax-free exchange"
"6055","of an equal aggregate value of newly-issued common shares of"
"6056","the Registrant.   The Boards of Trustees of each of the"
"6057","Registrant and the OM Funds approved its respective"
"6058","Reorganization."

Touchstone to the extent indicated above, intending to be

ARTICLE I

THE REORGANIZATION

      1.1                                 The Reorganization In
accordance with the Amended and Restated Agreement and
Declaration of Trust and the Amended and Restated By-laws, as
they may be amended from time to time, of the Acquired Trust
(the Old Mutual Governing Documents), at the Effective Time
(as defined below), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, and on the basis of the
representations and warranties contained herein, the Acquired
Fund shall assign, deliver and otherwise transfer all Fund
Assets, subject to all of the liabilities of the Acquired Fund
as set forth on the statement of assets and liabilities to be
provided pursuant to paragraph 5.6 (the Liabilities), to the
Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the
Liabilities of the Acquired Fund.  In consideration of the
foregoing, the Acquiring Fund, at the Effective Time shall
deliver to the Acquired Fund full and fractional (to the third
decimal place) shares of the Acquiring Fund.  The aggregate
number of shares of the Acquiring Fund shall be determined as
set forth in paragraph 2.3 by dividing (a) the value of the
Fund Assets attributable to the Acquired Fund, net of the
Acquired Fund's Liabilities (computed as of the Valuation Time
(as defined below) in the manner set forth in paragraph 2.1),
by (b) the net asset value of one share of the corresponding
class of the Acquiring Fund shares (computed as of the
Valuation Time in the manner set forth in paragraph 2.2).
Holders of each class of shares of the Acquired Fund will
receive shares of the Corresponding Class, as set forth in
Section E of the Recitals and Exhibit A to this Agreement, of
the Acquiring Fund, as set forth in Section A of the Recitals.
At and after the Effective Time, all of the Fund Assets of the
Acquired Fund shall become and be included in the Fund Assets
of the Acquiring Fund and the Liabilities of the Acquired Fund
shall

2



become and be the Liabilities of and shall attach to the
Acquiring Fund.  At and after the Effective Time, the
Liabilities of the Acquired Fund may be enforced only against
the Acquiring Fund to the same extent as if such Liabilities
had been incurred by the Acquiring Fund subject to any defense
and/or set off that the Acquired Fund was entitled to assert
immediately prior to the Effective Time and further subject to
any defense and/or setoff that the Acquiring Trust or the
Acquiring Fund may from time to time be entitled to assert.

      1.2                                 The Acquired Fund
Assets.

            (a)                                  At least ten
Business Days prior to the Valuation Time, the Acquired Fund
will provide the Acquiring Fund with a schedule of the
securities and other assets and Liabilities of the Acquired
Fund.  Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Acquiring
Fund has provided the Acquired Fund with a copy of its current
investment objective, investment policies, principal
investment strategies, and restrictions and will provide the
Acquired Fund with a written notice of any changes thereto
through the Valuation Time.  The Acquired Fund reserves the
right to sell any of the securities or other assets shown on
the schedule it provides to the Acquiring Fund pursuant to
this paragraph 1.2(a) in the ordinary course as necessary to
meet distribution and redemption requirements prior to the
Valuation Time but will not, without the prior approval of the
Acquiring Fund, acquire any additional securities other than
securities which the Acquiring Fund may purchase in accordance
with its stated investment objective and policies.

            (b)                                 At least five
Business Days prior to the Valuation Time, the Acquiring Fund
will advise the Acquired Fund of any investments of the
Acquired Fund shown on the Acquired Fund's schedule provided
pursuant to paragraph 1.2(a) which the Acquiring Fund would
not be permitted to hold (i) under its investment objective,
principal investment strategies or investment restrictions;
(ii) under applicable Law; or (iii) because the transfer of
such investments would result in material operational or
administrative difficulties to the Acquiring Fund in
connection with facilitating the orderly transition of the
Acquired Fund's Fund Assets.  Under such circumstances, to the
extent practicable, the Acquired Fund will, if requested by
the Acquiring Fund and, to the extent permissible and
consistent with its own investment objectives and policies and
the fiduciary duties of the investment adviser or sub-adviser
responsible for the portfolio management of the Acquired Fund,
dispose of such investments prior to the Valuation Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein will require the
Acquired Fund to dispose of any portfolio securities or other
investments of the Acquired Fund, if, in the reasonable
judgment of the Old Mutual Board or the Acquired Fund's
investment adviser or sub-adviser, such disposition would
adversely affect the tax-free nature of the Reorganization for
federal income tax purposes or would otherwise not be in the
best interests of the Acquired Fund and its shareholders.

      1.3                                 Assumption of
Liabilities.  The Acquired Fund will, to the extent
permissible and consistent with its own investment objectives
and policies, use its best efforts to discharge all of the
Liabilities of the Acquired Fund prior to or at the Effective
Time.  The Acquiring Fund will assume all of the Liabilities
of the Acquired Fund.  If prior to the Effective Time either
Party identifies a Liability that the Parties mutually agree
should not be assumed by the Acquiring Fund, such Liability
shall be excluded from the definition of Liabilities hereunder
and shall be listed on a Schedule of Excluded Liabilities to
be signed by the Parties at the Closing (the Excluded"
"6103","Liabilities).  The Acquiring Fund shall not assume any
Liability for any obligation of the Acquired Fund to file
reports with the SEC, Internal Revenue Service or other
regulatory or tax authority covering any reporting period
ending prior to or at the Effective Time with respect to the
Acquired Fund.

3



      1.4                                 Distribution of
Acquiring Fund Shares.  Immediately upon receipt, the Acquired
Fund will distribute the Corresponding Class shares of the
Acquiring Fund received by the Acquired Fund from the
Acquiring Fund pursuant to paragraph 1.1  pro rata to the
record holders of shares of the Acquired Fund.  Such
distribution will be accomplished by transferring the
Acquiring Fund Shares then credited to the Acquired Fund's
account on the Books and Records of the Acquiring Fund to open
accounts on the Books and Records of the Acquiring Fund
established and maintained by the Acquiring Fund's transfer
agent in the names of record holders of the Acquired Fund and
representing the respective pro rata number of the Acquiring
Fund Shares due to such record holder.  All issued and
outstanding shares of the Acquired Fund will, without further
notice, be cancelled promptly by the Acquired Fund on the
Acquired Fund's Books and Records.  Any such shares issued and
outstanding prior to such cancellation shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Acquiring Fund Shares
issued to the Acquired Fund in accordance with paragraph 1.1
above.  In addition, each record holder of the Acquired Fund
shall have the right to receive any unpaid dividends or other
distributions which were declared with respect to his/her or
its shares of the Acquired Fund at or before the Valuation
Time.

      1.5                                 Liquidation of the
Acquired Fund.  As soon as conveniently practicable after the
distribution of the Acquiring Fund Shares pursuant to
paragraph 1.4 has been made, the Acquired Fund shall take, in
accordance with Delaware law, the 1940 Act and the Old Mutual
Governing Documents, all such other steps as may be necessary
or appropriate to effect a complete liquidation and
termination of the Acquired Fund.

      1.6                                 Transfer Taxes.  Any
transfer taxes payable on issuance of the Acquiring Fund
Shares in a name other than that of the record holder of the
Acquired Fund shares on the Acquired Fund's Books and Records
shall be paid by the Person to whom such Acquiring Fund Shares
are issued and transferred, as a condition of that transfer.

ARTICLE II

VALUATION

      2.1                                 Net Asset Value of
the Acquired Fund.  The net asset value of a share of each
class of the Acquired Fund shall be the net asset value
computed as of the Valuation Time, after the declaration and
payment of any dividends and/or other distributions on the
date thereof, using the valuation procedures described in the
then-current prospectus and statement of additional
information of the Acquired Fund as supplemented from time to
time, or such other valuation procedures as shall be mutually
agreed upon by the parties.

      2.2                                 Net Asset Value of

class of the Acquiring Fund shall be the net asset value
computed as of the Valuation Time, after the declaration and
payment of any dividends and/or other distributions on the
date thereof, using the valuation procedures described in the
then-current prospectus and statement of additional
information of the Acquiring Fund as supplemented from time to
time, or such other valuation procedures as shall be mutually
agreed upon by the parties.

      2.3                                 Calculation of Number
of Acquiring Fund Shares.  The number of Acquiring Fund Shares
to be issued (including fractional shares (to the third
decimal place), if any) in connection with the Reorganization
shall be determined by dividing the value of (i) the net
assets of the Acquired Fund participating therein attributable
to the Corresponding Class share, determined in accordance
with the valuation procedures referred to in paragraph 2.1 by
the net

4



asset value per share of the Acquiring Fund's corresponding
share class determined in accordance with the valuation
procedures referred to in paragraph 2.2.

      2.4                                 Determination of Net

"6104","Mellon), sub-administrator for the Acquired Fund, in
accordance with its regular practice and the requirements of
the 1940 Act.

      2.5                                 Valuation Time.

ARTICLE III

      3.1                                 Effective Time and
Closing.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Reorganization shall occur immediately prior to
the opening of business on April 16, 2012, or on such other
date as may be mutually agreed in writing by an authorized
officer of each Party (the Effective Time).  To the extent
any Fund Assets are, for any reason, not transferred at the
Effective Time, the Acquired Fund shall cause such Fund Assets
to be transferred in accordance with this Agreement at the
earliest practical date thereafter.  The closing of the
Reorganization shall be held in person, by facsimile, by e-
mail or by such other communication means as may be mutually
agreed by the Parties, at the Effective Time (the Closing).

      3.2                                 Transfer and Delivery
of Fund Assets.  The Acquired Fund shall direct The Bank of
New York Mellon (Acquired Fund Custodian), as custodian for
the Acquired Fund, to deliver to the Acquiring Fund at  the
Closing, or promptly thereafter, consistent with commercially
reasonable standards, a certificate of an authorized officer
certifying that: (a) Acquired Fund Custodian delivered the
Fund Assets of the Acquired Fund to the Acquiring Fund at the
Effective Time; and (b) all necessary taxes in connection with
the delivery of such Fund Assets, including all applicable

reasonably estimated) for payment has been made.

market for portfolio securities of the Acquiring Fund or the
Acquired Fund is closed to trading, or trading thereupon is
restricted, or (b) trading or the reporting of trading on such
market is disrupted so that, in the judgment of an appropriate
officer of the Acquired Fund or the Acquiring Fund, accurate
appraisal of the value of the net assets of the Acquiring Fund
or the Acquired Fund is impracticable, the Valuation Time and
Effective Time shall be postponed until the first Business Day
that is a Friday after the day when trading shall have been

Trust is a statutory trust duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware
and is duly qualified, licensed or admitted to do business and
is in good standing as a foreign association under the Laws of
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification, licensing or
admission necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified, licensed or admitted and in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on its properties or assets or the

the properties and assets it now owns.  The Acquired Fund has
all necessary authorizations, licenses and approvals from any
applicable Governmental or Regulatory Body necessary to carry

Reorganization and has resolved to recommend the
Reorganization to the shareholders of the Acquired Fund and to

contemplated hereby.  Other than the approval by the requisite
vote of the shareholders of the outstanding shares of the
Acquired Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Old
Mutual Governing Documents, applicable Delaware Law and the
1940 Act, no other action on the part of the Acquired Fund or

delivered by the Acquired Trust on behalf of the Acquired Fund
and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof

consents, approvals, or waivers to be received prior to the
Effective Time, including shareholder approval by the Acquired
Fund, and upon the effectiveness of the Registration Statement

standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on its properties or assets or the
properties or assets of the Acquiring Fund.  The Acquiring

are no liabilities against, relating to or affecting the
Acquiring Fund or any of its properties and assets, other than
those incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, which, individually or in the aggregate,
would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquiring Fund or

Adverse Effect on the Acquiring Fund or its properties or
assets, and all such calculations have been made in accordance

Effect on the Acquiring Fund or its properties or assets other
than changes occurring in the ordinary course of business.

Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
the Acquiring Trust on behalf of the Acquiring Fund and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Acquired Trust on behalf of the Acquired Fund, constitutes a
valid and legally binding obligation of the Acquiring Trust,
on behalf of the Acquiring Fund, enforceable against the
Acquiring Trust in accordance with its terms, subject, as to
enforcement, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other Laws relating to or
affecting creditors' rights generally, fraudulent conveyance,
receivership, and to general equity principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and to an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing;

                  (vi)                              the

the transactions herein contemplated will not conflict with or
result in a material breach of the terms or provisions of, or
constitute a material default under, the Touchstone Governing
Documents or any material agreement or instrument pertaining

            (c)                                  The Acquiring
Fund shall have furnished to the Acquired Fund a certificate
of the Acquiring Fund, signed by the President or Vice
President and Treasurer of the Acquiring Trust, dated as of

shall not be true and correct in all material respects to cure
such condition.

            (b)                                 The Acquired

of shareholders exist with respect to any such shares or the
issue or delivery thereof;

                  (iv)                              except as
disclosed in writing to the Acquiring Fund, such counsel knows
of no material legal proceedings pending or threatened in
writing against the Acquired Trust;

                  (v)                                 this
Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
the Acquired Trust on behalf of the Acquired Fund and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Acquiring Trust on behalf of the Acquiring Fund, constitutes a
valid and legally binding obligation of the Acquired Trust, on
behalf of the Acquired Fund, enforceable against the Acquired
Trust in accordance with its terms, subject, as to

                  (vi)                              to the
knowledge of such counsel, as of the date of its mailing, the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and as of the date of its filing,
the Registration Statement (other than the financial
statements and other financial and statistical information
contained therein, as to which such counsel need express no
opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, 1934 Act and the 1940
Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder;

                  (vii)                           the execution
and delivery of this Agreement did not and the consummation of
the transactions herein contemplated will not result in a
material breach of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a
material default under, the Old Mutual Governing Documents or
any material agreement or instrument pertaining to the
Acquired Fund identified as an Exhibit in Part C of the
registration statement on Form N-1A last filed by the Acquired
Trust;

                  (viii)                        the execution and
delivery of this Agreement did not and the consummation of the
transactions herein contemplated will not result in a material
violation by the Acquired Fund of any terms, conditions, or
provisions of any federal securities Law or the Delaware
Statutory Trust Act; and

                  (ix)                                to the
knowledge of such counsel, no consent, approval, authorization
or other action by or filing with any Governmental or
Regulatory Body is required in connection with the
consummation of the transactions herein contemplated, except
such as have been obtained or made under the 1933 Act, 1934
Act and the 1940 Act and the applicable

21



rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder and Delaware Law
and such authorizations and filings as are necessary to
terminate the Acquired Funds as series of a Delaware statutory
trust.

      In rendering such opinion, Stradley Ronon Stevens &
Young, LLP may rely upon certificates of officers of the
Acquired Trust and of public officials as to matters of fact.

            (c)                                  The Acquired
Fund shall have furnished to the Acquiring Fund the unaudited
statements required by paragraph 5.6.

            (d)                                 The Acquired
Fund shall have furnished to the Acquiring Fund a certificate
of the Acquired Fund, signed by the President or Vice
President and Treasurer of the Acquired Trust, dated as of the
Effective Time, to the effect that they have examined the

any supplement thereto) and this Agreement and that:

                  (i)                                     to the

the Acquired Trust in this Agreement are true and correct in
all material respects on and as of the Effective Time and the
Acquired Trust has complied with all the agreements and
satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or

                  (ii)                                  since the
date of the most recent financial statements of the Acquired
Fund included in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any
supplement thereto), there has been no Material Adverse Effect
on the business of the Acquired Fund (other than changes in
the ordinary course of business, including, without
limitation, dividends and other distributions in the ordinary
course and changes in net asset value per share), except as
set forth in or contemplated in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
(or any supplement thereto).

Fund shall have duly executed and delivered to the Acquiring
Trust such bills of sale, assignments, certificates and other
instruments of transfer, including transfer instructions to

Acquiring Trust may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
evidence the transfer to the Acquiring Fund of all of the
right, title and interest of the Acquired Fund in and to the
respective Fund Assets of the Acquired Fund.  In each case,
the Fund Assets of the Acquired Fund shall be accompanied by
all necessary state stock transfer stamps or cash for the
appropriate purchase price therefor.

            (f)                                    The Acquiring

number and percentage (to three decimal places) of ownership
of each series of the Acquired Fund shares owned by each such
holder as of the close of business at the Valuation Time.

            (g)                                 At the Valuation
Time and Effective Time, except as previously disclosed to the
Acquiring Fund in writing, and except as have been corrected
as required by applicable Law, there shall have been no
material miscalculations of the net asset value of the
Acquired Fund during the twelve-month period preceding the
Valuation Time and Effective Time, and all such calculations
shall have been made in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the 1940

22




Act.  At the Valuation Time and Effective Time, all
Liabilities chargeable to the Acquired Fund which are required
to be reflected in the net asset value per share of a share
class of the Acquired Fund in accordance with applicable Law
will be reflected in the net asset value per share of the
Acquired Fund.

            (h)                                 Except for those

agreements with each of its service contractors shall have
terminated at the Effective Time, and each Party has received
assurance that no claims for damages (liquidated or otherwise)
will arise as a result of such termination.

      6.3                                 Other Conditions
Precedent.  Unless waived in writing by the Parties with the
consent of their respective boards of trustees, the
consummation of the Reorganization is subject to the
fulfillment, prior to or at the Effective Time, of each of the
following conditions:

            (a)                                  This Agreement
and the transactions contemplated herein shall have been
approved by the requisite vote of the holders of the
outstanding shares of the Acquired Fund in accordance with the
provisions of the Old Mutual Governing Documents, applicable
Delaware Law and the 1940 Act.  Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, neither the Acquired Trust nor the
Acquiring Trust may waive the conditions set forth in this
paragraph 6.3(a).

            (b)                                 The Registration
Statement shall have become effective under the 1933 Act, and
no stop order suspending effectiveness of the Registration
Statement shall have been issued and no proceedings for that
purpose shall have been pending or threatened in writing.

            (c)                                  Each of the
Acquiring Fund and the Acquired Fund shall have received a
favorable opinion of Pepper Hamilton LLP substantially to the
effect that, for federal income tax purposes:

                  (i)                                     The
acquisition by the Acquiring Fund of substantially all of the
assets of the Acquired Fund solely in exchange for the
Acquiring Fund's assumption of certain of the liabilities of
the Acquired Fund and issuance of the Acquiring Fund Shares,
followed by the distribution of such Acquiring Fund Shares by
the Acquired Fund in liquidation to the Acquired Fund
shareholders in exchange for their Acquired Fund shares, all
as provided in this Agreement, will constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and the Acquired Fund and the Acquiring Fund each will
be a party to a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(b) of the Code;

                  (ii)                                  Under Code
Section 361, no gain or loss will be recognized by the
Acquired Fund (i) upon the transfer of substantially all of
its assets to the Acquiring Fund solely in exchange for the
Acquiring Fund Shares and the assumption by the Acquiring Fund
of certain of the liabilities of the Acquired Fund or (ii)
upon the distribution of the Acquiring Fund Shares by the
Acquired Fund to the Acquired Fund shareholders in
liquidation, as contemplated in this Agreement

                  (iii)                               Under Code
Section 1032, no gain or loss will be recognized by the
Acquiring Fund upon the receipt of the assets of the Acquired
Fund solely in exchange for the assumption of certain of the
liabilities of the Acquired Fund and issuance of the Acquiring
Fund Shares as contemplated in this Agreement;

                  (iv)                              Under Code
Section 362(b), the tax basis of the assets of the Acquired
Fund acquired by the Acquiring Fund will be the same as the
tax basis of such assets in the hands of the Acquired Fund
immediately prior to the Reorganization;

23



                  (v)                                 Under Code
Section 1223(2), the holding periods of the assets of the
Acquired Fund in the hands of the Acquiring Fund will include
the periods during which such assets were held by the Acquired
Fund;

                  (vi)                              Under Code
Section 354, no gain or loss will be recognized by the
Acquired Fund shareholders upon the exchange of all of their
Acquired Fund shares solely for the Acquiring Fund Shares in
the Reorganization;

                  (vii)                           Under Code
Section 358, the aggregate tax basis of the Acquiring Fund
Shares to be received by each Acquired Fund shareholder
pursuant to the Reorganization will be the same as the
aggregate tax basis of the Acquired Fund shares exchanged
therefore;

                  (viii)                        Under Code Section
1223(1), an Acquired Fund shareholder's holding period for the
Acquiring Fund Shares to be received will include the period
during which the Acquired Fund shares exchanged therefor were
held, provided that the Acquired Fund shareholder held the
Acquired Fund shares as a capital asset on the date of the
Reorganization.

No opinion will be expressed as to (1) the effect of the
Reorganization on (A) the Acquired Fund or the Acquiring Fund
with respect to any asset as to which any unrealized gain or
loss is required to be recognized for U.S. federal income tax
purposes at the end of a taxable year (or on the termination
or transfer thereof) under a mark-to-market system of
accounting and (B) any Acquired Fund shareholder or Acquiring
Fund shareholder that is required to recognize unrealized
gains and losses for U.S. federal income tax purposes under a
mark-to-market system of accounting, or (C) the Acquired Fund
or the Acquiring Fund with respect to any stock held in a
passive foreign investment company as defined in Section
1297(a) of the Code or (2) any other federal tax issues
(except those set forth above) and all state, local or foreign
tax issues of any kind.

Such opinion shall be based on customary assumptions,
limitations and such representations as Pepper Hamilton LLP
may reasonably request, and the Acquired Fund and Acquiring
Fund will cooperate to make and certify the accuracy of such
representations.  Such opinion may contain such assumptions
and limitations as shall be in the opinion of such counsel
appropriate to render the opinions expressed therein.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the
Acquiring Fund nor the Acquired Fund may waive the conditions
set forth in this paragraph 6.3(c).

            (d)                                 At the Effective
Time, the SEC shall not have issued an unfavorable report
under Section 25(b) of the 1940 Act, and there shall be no
proceedings pending that would seek to enjoin the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
Section 25(c) of the 1940 Act.  No Action or Proceeding
against the Acquired Fund or the Acquiring Trust or their
respective officers or trustees shall be threatened in writing
or pending before any court or other Governmental or
Regulatory Body in which it will seek, or seeks to restrain or
prohibit any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or to obtain damages or other relief in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

            (e)                                  Closing of the
purchase agreement by and among Touchstone Advisors, Inc., Old

Acquired Fund's shareholders of record (the Acquired Fund"

Date (as defined below), the Acquiring Fund Shares received by the
Acquired Fund pursuant to paragraph 1.1; and (b) the Acquired Fund will
thereupon proceed to terminate as set forth in paragraph 1.8 below. Such

on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the share records
of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the Acquired Fund Shareholders and
representing the respective pro rata number of the Acquiring Fund Shares
due such shareholders. All issued and outstanding shares of the Acquired

asset value computed as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time on the Business Day

Pepper Hamilton LLP addressed to the Acquiring Fund and the Acquired
Fund substantially to the effect that, for federal income tax purposes:

                  (a)          The acquisition by the Acquiring Fund of all
of the assets of the Acquired Fund solely in exchange for the Acquiring
Fund's assumption of all of the liabilities of the Acquired Fund and
issuance of the Acquiring Fund Shares, followed by the distribution of
such Acquiring Fund Shares by the Acquired Fund in complete liquidation
to the Acquired Fund shareholders in exchange for their Acquired Fund
shares, all as provided in this Agreement, will constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the
Acquired Fund and the Acquiring Fund each will be a party to a"
"6109","reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code;

                  (b)          Under Code Section 361, no gain or loss will
be recognized by the Acquired Fund (i) upon the transfer of its assets
to the Acquiring Fund solely in exchange for the Acquiring Fund Shares
and the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of all of the liabilities of
the Acquired Fund or (ii) upon the distribution of the Acquiring Fund
Shares by the Acquired Fund to the Acquired Fund Shareholders in
complete liquidation, as contemplated in this Agreement;

                  (c)          Under Code Section 1032, no gain or loss

liabilities of the Acquired Fund and issuance of the Acquiring Fund
Shares as contemplated in this Agreement;

                  (d)          Under Code Section 362(b), the tax basis of
the assets of the Acquired Fund received by the Acquiring Fund will be
the same as the tax basis of such assets in the hands of the Acquired
Fund immediately prior to the Reorganization;

                  (e)          Under Code Section 1223(2), the holding
periods of the assets of the Acquired Fund in the hands of the Acquiring
Fund will include the periods during which such assets were held by the
Acquired Fund;

                  (f)          Under Code Section 354, no gain or loss will
be recognized by the Acquired Fund Shareholders upon the exchange of all
of their Acquired Fund shares solely for the Acquiring Fund Shares in
the Reorganization;

                  (g)          Under Code Section 358, the aggregate tax

aggregate tax basis of the Acquired Fund shares exchanged therefor; and

                  (h)          Under Code Section 1223(1), an Acquired Fund
Shareholder's holding period for the Acquiring Fund Shares to be
received will include the period during which the Acquired Fund shares
exchanged therefor were held by such shareholder, provided that the
Acquired Fund Shareholder held the Acquired Fund shares as a capital
asset at the time of the Reorganization.

            No opinion will be expressed as to (1) the effect of the
Reorganization on (A) the Acquired Fund or the Acquiring Fund with
respect to any asset as to which any unrealized gain or loss is required
to be recognized for U.S. federal income tax purposes at the end of a
taxable year (or on the termination or transfer thereof) under a mark-
to-market system of accounting, (B) any Acquired Fund shareholder or
Acquiring Fund shareholder that is required to recognize unrealized
gains and losses for U.S. federal income tax purposes under a mark-to-
market system of accounting, or (C) the Acquired Fund or the Acquiring
Fund with respect to any stock held in a passive foreign investment
company as defined in Section 1297(a) of the Code or (2) any other
federal tax issues (except those set forth above) and all state, local
or foreign tax issues of any kind.

            Such opinion shall be based on customary assumptions,
limitations and such representations as Pepper Hamilton LLP may
reasonably request, and the Acquired Fund and Acquiring Fund will
cooperate to make and certify the accuracy of such representations. Such
opinion may contain such assumptions and limitations as shall be in the
opinion of such counsel appropriate to render the opinions expressed
therein. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the
Acquiring Fund nor the Acquired Fund may waive the conditions set forth
in this paragraph 8.5.

hereinafter contained, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the Parties, and
FTAM and Touchstone Advisors to the extent indicated above, intending to
be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

TRANSFER OF ASSETS OF THE ACQUIRED FUND IN EXCHANGE FOR ACQUIRING FUND
SHARES AND LIQUIDATION AND DISSOLUTION OF THE ACQUIRED FUND

      1.1           THE EXCHANGE.  Subject to the terms and conditions
contained herein and on the basis of the representations and warranties
contained herein, the Acquired Fund agrees to transfer all Fund Assets,
as defined in paragraph 1.2, to the Acquiring Fund.  In exchange, the
Acquiring Fund agrees to assume the liabilities of the Acquired Fund, as
set forth in paragraph 1.3, and deliver to the Acquired Fund full and
fractional shares of the Acquiring Fund (Acquiring Fund Shares).  The
number of full and fractional shares of each Corresponding Class of
Acquiring Fund Shares (to the third decimal place) shall be determined
by dividing (a) the value of the Fund Assets attributable to the
corresponding class of the Acquired Fund, net of the Acquired Fund's
Liabilities attributed to that class of the Acquired Fund (computed as
of the Valuation Time (as defined in paragraph 2.5) in the manner set
forth in paragraph 2.1), by (b) the net asset value of one share of such
Corresponding Class of the Acquiring Fund Shares (computed as of the
Valuation Time in the manner set forth in paragraph 2.2).  Holders of
each class of shares of the Acquired Fund will receive shares of the
Corresponding Class of the Acquiring Fund, as set forth in Exhibit A to
this Agreement.  Such transactions shall take place at the closing on
the Effective Time provided for in paragraph 3.1.

      1.2           ASSETS TO BE ACQUIRED. The assets of the Acquired
Fund to be acquired by the Acquiring Fund shall consist of all Fund
Assets.  Fund Assets shall mean all properties and assets of every
kind and description whatsoever, including, without limitation, all
cash, cash equivalents, securities, claims (whether absolute or
contingent, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued and including, but
not limited to, any claims that the Acquired Fund may have against any
Person), litigation proceeds of any type (including, without limitation,
proceeds resulting from litigation involving portfolio securities as
well as market timing/late trading actions or settlements) and
receivables (including dividend and interest receivable), goodwill and
other intangible property, Books and Records, and all interests, rights,
privileges and powers, owned by the Acquired Fund, and any prepaid
expenses shown on the Acquired Fund's books at the Valuation Time.

      (a) The Acquired Fund has provided the Acquiring Fund with its most
recent audited financial statements, which contain a list of all of the
Acquired Fund's assets as of the date of such statements.  The Acquired
Fund hereby represents that as of the date of the execution of this
Agreement and as of the Effective Time (as defined below), there have
been no changes in its financial position as reflected in such financial
statements other than those occurring in the ordinary course of business
in connection with the purchase and sale of securities, the issuance and
redemption of Acquired Fund shares and the payment of normal operating
expenses, dividends and capital gains distributions.

      (b)           At least ten Business Days prior to the Valuation
Time, the Acquired Fund will provide the Acquiring Fund with a complete
schedule of the securities and other assets of the Acquired Fund.  At
least five Business Days prior to the Valuation Time, the Acquiring Fund
will advise the Acquired Fund in writing of any investments of the
Acquired Fund shown on the Acquired Fund's schedule provided above which
the Acquiring Fund would not be permitted to hold (a) under its
investment goal, principal investment strategies or investment
restrictions; or (b) under applicable Law.  Under such circumstances
and, to the extent practicable, the Acquired Fund will, if requested by
the Acquiring Fund in writing and, to the extent permissible and
consistent with its own investment objectives and policies, dispose of
such investments prior to the Valuation Time.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein will require the Acquired Fund to dispose of
any portfolio securities or other investments, if, in the reasonable
judgment of
the Fifth Third Board or FTAM, such disposition would adversely affect
the tax-free nature of the Reorganization for federal income tax
purposes or would otherwise not be in the best interests of the Acquired
Fund.  The Acquired Fund shall promptly notify the Acquiring Fund of any
such determination.

      1.3           LIABILITIES TO BE ASSUMED OR DISCHARGED.  The
Acquired Fund will, to the extent permissible and consistent with its
own investment objectives and policies, use its best efforts to
discharge all of the liabilities of the Acquired Fund prior to the
Effective Time. The liabilities of the Acquired Fund to be assumed by
the Acquiring Fund shall consist of all of the liabilities set forth on
the unaudited statement of assets and liabilities to be provided
pursuant to paragraph 5.6 (Liabilities).

      1.4           DISTRIBUTION OF ACQUIRING FUND SHARES.  Immediately
upon receipt, the Acquired Fund will distribute the Corresponding Class
of Acquiring Fund Shares received by the Acquired Fund from the
Acquiring Fund pursuant to paragraph 1.1 pro rata to the record holders
of shares of the corresponding class of the Acquired Fund.  Such
distribution will be accomplished by transferring the Acquiring Fund
Shares then credited to the Acquired Fund's account on the Books and
Records of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the Books and Records
of the Acquiring Fund established and maintained by the Acquiring Fund's
transfer agent in the names of the record holders of shares of the
Acquired Fund and representing the respective pro rata number of the
Acquiring Fund Shares due to such record holders.  All issued and
outstanding shares of the Acquired Fund will, without further notice, be
cancelled promptly by the Acquired Fund on the Acquired Fund's Books and
Records.  Any such shares issued and outstanding prior to such
cancellation shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Acquiring Fund Shares issued to the Acquired Fund in accordance with

Registrant on behalf of the Acquired Fund, and assuming due

the 1940 Act) of the Acquiring Fund's investment adviser or the Acquired
Fund's investment adviser; (b) no unfair burden (as that term is
defined in Section 15(f)(2)(B) of the 1940 Act) shall be imposed on the
Acquired Fund; and (c) each vacancy among the trustees of the Acquiring

the 1940 Act, as if such Section were applicable, shall be filled in the
manner specified by Section 16(b) of the 1940 Act.  The Acquiring Fund

Fund Registrant, on behalf of the Acquired Fund, enforceable against the
Acquired Fund Registrant in accordance with its terms;

                  (v)          the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Acquired Fund Registrant did not and the consummation of the
transactions herein contemplated by the Acquired Fund Registrant will
not result in a material breach of the terms or provisions of, or
constitute a material default under, the Fifth Third Governing Documents
(assuming that approval of shareholders of the Acquired Fund has been
obtained);

                  (vi)          the execution and delivery of this
Agreement did not and the consummation of the transactions herein
contemplated will not result in a material violation by the Acquired
Fund Registrant or the Acquired Fund of any provisions of any statutory
federal securities Law or the statutory laws of the Commonwealth of

      7.4         The Registration Statement shall have become effective

                  (i)           The acquisition by the Acquiring Fund of
all of the assets of the Acquired Fund solely in exchange for the
Acquiring Fund's assumption of the Liabilities of the Acquired Fund and
issuance of the Acquiring Fund Shares, followed by the distribution of
such Acquiring Fund Shares by the Acquired Fund in complete liquidation
to the Acquired Fund shareholders in exchange for their Acquired Fund
shares, all as provided in this Agreement, will constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the
Acquired Fund and the Acquiring Fund each will be a party to a"
"6116","reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code;

                  (ii)          Under Code Section 361, no gain or loss

the same as the tax basis of such assets in the hands of the Acquired
Fund immediately prior to the Reorganization;

                  (v)          Under Code Section 1223(2), the holding

asset at the time of the Reorganization.

No opinion will be expressed as to (1) the effect of the Reorganization
on (A) the Acquired Fund or the Acquiring Fund with respect to any asset

U.S. federal income tax purposes at the end of a taxable year (or on the
termination or transfer thereof) under a mark-to-market system of
accounting and (B) any Acquired Fund shareholder or Acquiring Fund

such representations as Pepper Hamilton LLP may reasonably request, and
the Acquired Fund and Acquiring Fund will cooperate to make and certify
the accuracy of such representations.  Such opinion may contain such
assumptions and limitations as shall be in the opinion of such counsel
