"599","<TEXT>"
"600","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"601","To the Board of Trustees of Credit Suisse Trust"
"602","and Shareholders of Credit Suisse Trust Commodity Return Strategy Portfolio:"
"603","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"604","Credit Suisse Trust Commodity Return Strategy Portfolio and its"
"605","Subsidiary (which comprise Credit Suisse Trust, hereafter referred"
"606","to as the Trust) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, in"
"607","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"608","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust's internal"
"609","control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"610","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"611","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"612","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose"
"613","of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal"
"614","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an"
"615","opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over"
"616","financial reporting."
"617","The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and"
"618","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"619","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"620","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"621","controls.  A trust's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"622","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"623","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"624","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"625","accounting principles.  A trust's internal control over financial"
"626","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"627","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"628","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the"
"629","trust; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"630","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance"
"631","with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"632","expenditures of the trust are being made only in accordance with"
"633","authorizations of management and trustees of the trust; and (3)  provide"
"634","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"635","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a trust's assets"
"636","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"637","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"638","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"639","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk"
"640","that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or"
"641","that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"642","deteriorate."
"643","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"644","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"645","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"646","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"647","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"648","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"649","possibility that a material misstatement of the Trust's annual or"
"650","interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"651","timely basis."
"652","Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial"
"653","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"654","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"655","over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under"
"656","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"657","United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trust's"
"658","internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including"
"659","controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"660","weaknesses as defined above as of December 31, 2012."
"661","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"662","and the Board of Trustees of Credit Suisse Trust and the Securities and"
"663","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"664","anyone other than these specified parties."

"680","Dear Trustees:"
"681","We are providing this letter to you for inclusion as an exhibit to"
"682","your Form N-SAR filing pursuant to Item 77L."
"683","We have audited the consolidated financial statements included in"
"684","the Fund's Annual Report on Form N-CSR for the year ended"
"685","December 31, 2012 and issued our report thereon dated February 20, 2013."
"686","Note 2 to the financial statements describes a change in the Fund's"
"687","basis of presentation relating to the Fund's investment in a"
"688","wholly-owned subsidiary of the Fund (the Subsidiary).  The Fund"
"689","previously presented its financial statements as a portfolio"
"690","investment in which the Fund's investment in the Subsidiary is"
"691","presented as a single line item within the Fund's statement of"
"692","assets and liabilities and the financial statements of the"
"693","Subsidiaries accompanied the audited financial statements of"
"694","the Fund."
"695","The Fund has changed its methodology to currently consolidate"
"696","the financial statements of the Subsidiaries.  It should be"
"697","understood that the preferability of one acceptable method of"
"698","accounting over another for determining whether to consolidate"
"699","or utilize a portfolio investment presentation has not been"
"700","addressed in any authoritative accounting literature, and in"
"701","expressing our concurrence below we have relied on management's"
"702","determination that this change in accounting principle is preferable."
"703","Based on our reading of management's stated reasons and justification"
"704","for this change in accounting principle in Form N-CSR, and our"
"705","discussions with management as to their judgment about the relevant"
"706","business planning factors relating to the change, we concur with"
"707","management that such change represents, in the Funds' circumstances,"
"708","the adoption of a preferable accounting principle in conformity"
"709","with Accounting Standards Codification 250, Accounting Changes and"
"710","Error Corrections."
