"473","<TEXT>"
"474","Report of Independent"
"475","Registered Public Accounting"
"476","Firm"
"477","To the Board of Trustees of The"
"478","Glenmede Portfolios and"
"479","Shareholders of the Muni"
"480","Intermediate Portfolio:"
"481","In our opinion, the accompanying"
"482","statement of assets and liabilities,"
"483","including the schedule of portfolio"
"484","investments, and the related"
"485","statements of operations and of"
"486","changes in net assets and the"
"487","financial highlights present fairly,"
"488","in all material respects, the"
"489","financial position of the Muni"
"490","Intermediate Portfolio (the sole"
"491","portfolio constituting The"
"492","Glenmede Portfolios, hereafter"
"493","referred to as the Fund) at"
"494","October 31, 2015, the results of its"
"495","operations for the year then"
"496","ended, the changes in its net"
"497","assets for each of the two years in"
"498","the period then ended and the"
"499","financial highlights for each of the"
"500","five years in the period then"
"501","ended, in conformity with"
"502","accounting principles generally"
"503","accepted in the United States of"
"504","America.  These financial"
"505","statements and financial"
"506","highlights (hereafter referred to as"
"507","financial statements) are the"
"508","responsibility of the Fund's"
"509","management.  Our responsibility"
"510","is to express an opinion on these"
"511","financial statements based on our"
"512","audits. We conducted our audits"
"513","of these financial statements in"
"514","accordance with the standards of"
"515","the Public Company Accounting"
"516","Oversight Board (United States)."
"517","Those standards require that we"
"518","plan and perform the audit to"
"519","obtain reasonable assurance about"
"520","whether the financial statements"
"521","are free of material misstatement."
"522","An audit includes examining, on a"
"523","test basis, evidence supporting the"
"524","amounts and disclosures in the"
"525","financial statements, assessing the"
"526","accounting principles used and"
"527","significant estimates made by"
"528","management, and evaluating the"
"529","overall financial statement"
"530","presentation.  We believe that our"
"531","audits, which included"
"532","confirmation of securities at"
"533","October 31, 2015 by"
"534","correspondence with the"
"535","custodian and brokers, and the"
"536","application of alternative auditing"
"537","procedures where securities"
"538","purchased had not been received,"
"539","provide a reasonable basis for our"
"540","opinion."
