"1446","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1447","To the Trustees of Putnam Asset Allocation Funds and"
"1448","Shareholders of Putnam Dynamic Asset Allocation Growth Fund:"
"1449","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"1450","statements of Putnam Dynamic Asset Allocation Growth Fund (the"
"1451","Fund) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2014, in"
"1452","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1453","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds"
"1454","internal control over financial reporting, including controls"
"1455","over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our"
"1456","auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"1457","on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"1458","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"1459","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
"1460","internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do"
"1461","not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
"1462","internal control over financial reporting."
"1463","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1464","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"1465","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1466","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"1467","benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds internal"
"1468","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1469","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"1470","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"1471","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1472","accepted accounting principles.  A funds internal control over"
"1473","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"1474","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1475","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1476","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1477","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1478","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1479","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1480","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"1481","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"1482","of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1483","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1484","use or disposition of a funds assets that could have a"
"1485","material effect on the financial statements."
"1486","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1487","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1488","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1489","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1490","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"1491","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1492","deteriorate."
"1493","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"1494","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"1495","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"1496","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1497","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"1498","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"1499","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1500","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1501","Funds annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"1502","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1503","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"1504","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1505","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"1506","in internal control over financial reporting that might be"
"1507","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"1508","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"1509","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal control over"
"1510","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"1511","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"1512","weaknesses as defined above as of September 30, 2014."
"1513","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1514","management and the Board of Trustees of Putnam Dynamic Asset"
"1515","Allocation Growth Fund and the Securities and Exchange"
"1516","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"1517","anyone other than these specified parties."

"1587","ARTICLE 2"
"1588","Meetings of Trustees"
"1589","      2.1  Regular Meetings.  Regular meetings of the Trustees may"
"1590","be held without call or notice at such places and at such times"
"1591","as the Trustees may from time to time determine, provided that"
"1592","notice of the first regular meeting following any such"
"1593","determination shall be given to absent Trustees."
"1594","      2.2  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Trustees may"

"1599","each Trustee by the Clerk or an Assistant Clerk or by the officer"
"1600","or the Trustees calling the meeting."
"1601","      2.3  Notice of Special Meetings.  It shall be sufficient"
"1602","notice to a Trustee of a special meeting: (a) to send notice (i)"
"1603","by mail at least forty-eight hours before the meeting, (ii) by"

"1638","or more written consents thereto are signed by a majority of the"
"1639","Trustees.  Any written consent may be given by mail, courier, e-"

"1651","ARTICLE 3"
"1652","Officers"
"1653","      3.1  Enumeration; Qualification.  The officers of the Trust"
"1654","shall be a President, a Treasurer, a Clerk and such other"
"1655","officers (including Vice President, which shall include the"

"1657","time to time may in their discretion elect.  The Trust may also"
"1658","have such agents as the Trustees from time to time may in their"
"1659","discretion appoint.  In addition, there shall be a Chair of the"
"1660","Trustees, who will be considered an officer of the Trustees and"
"1661","not of the Trust.  The Chair of the Trustees shall be a Trustee"
"1662","and may but need not be a Shareholder; and any other officer may"
"1663","but need not be a Trustee or a Shareholder.  Any two or more"

"1678","affiliates shall automatically terminate contemporaneously with"
"1679","the termination of such persons employment with, or service as"

"1682","      3.4  Powers.  Subject to the other provisions of these"
"1683","Bylaws, each officer shall have, in addition to the duties and"

"1703","meeting."

"2592","of such class held by each of them.  Such distributions shall be"
"2593","made in cash, Shares or other property, or a combination thereof,"
"2594","as determined by the Trustees.  Any such distribution paid in"
"2595","Shares will be paid at the net asset value thereof as determined"
"2596","in accordance with the Bylaws."
"2597","Redemptions and Repurchases"
"2598","      Section 2.	The Trust shall purchase such Shares as are offered"
"2599","by any Shareholder for redemption, upon the presentation of any"

"2602","designated by the Trust that the Trust purchase such Shares, or"
"2603","in accordance with such other procedures for redemption as the"
"2604","Trustees may from time to time authorize; and the Trust will pay"

"2606","accordance with the Bylaws, less any redemption charge fixed by"
"2607","the Trustees.  Payment for said Shares shall be made by the Trust"
"2608","to the Shareholder within seven days after the date on which the"
"2609","request is made.  The obligation set forth in this Section 2 is"
"2610","subject to the provision that in the event that at any time the"
"2611","New York Stock Exchange is closed for other than customary"
"2612","weekends or holidays, or, if permitted by rules of the Securities"

"2616","determine fairly the value of its net assets, or during any other"
"2617","period permitted by order of the Securities and Exchange"
"2618","Commission for the protection of investors, such obligation may"
"2619","be suspended or postponed by the Trustees.  The Trust may also"
"2620","purchase or repurchase Shares at a price not exceeding the net"
"2621","asset value of such Shares in effect when the purchase or"
"2622","repurchase or any contract to purchase or repurchase is made."

"2624","cash or, except to the extent prohibited by the laws of any"
"2625","jurisdiction in which Shares are registered for sale, in other"
"2626","property, or any combination thereof.  The composition of any"
"2627","such payment shall be determined by the Trust in its sole"
"2628","discretion, and the Trust shall have no obligation to effect a"
"2629","pro rata division of cash or other property in making any such"
"2630","payment.  In no event shall the Trust be liable for any delay of"
"2631","any other person in transferring securities or other property"

"2636","value thereof as determined in accordance with the Bylaws: (i) if"
"2637","at such time such Shareholder owns fewer Shares than, or Shares"
"2638","having an aggregate net asset value of less than, an amount"
"2639","determined from time to time by the Trustees, in which case the"
"2640","Trust may redeem all Shares owned by such Shareholder or only so"
"2641","many of such Shares as may be required to compensate the Trust"
"2642","for any fee fixed from time to time by the Trustees for the"
"2643","maintenance of small accounts; (ii) to the extent that such"
"2644","Shareholder owns Shares of a particular series of Shares equal to"
"2645","or in excess of a percentage of the outstanding Shares of that"
"2646","series determined from time to time by the Trustees; (iii) to the"
"2647","extent that such Shareholder owns Shares of the Trust"
"2648","representing a percentage equal to or in excess of such"
"2649","percentage of the aggregate number of outstanding Shares of the"
"2650","Trust or the aggregate net asset value of the Trust determined"
"2651","from time to time by the Trustees; (iv) if such Shareholder fails"
"2652","to supply appropriate personal and tax identification information"
"2653","requested by the Trust; (v) if such Shareholder fails to meet or"
"2654","maintain the qualifications for ownership of a particular series"
"2655","or class; or (vi) if the Trustees determine for any other reason,"
"2656","in their sole discretion, that the ownership of Shares by a"
"2657","Shareholder is not in the best interests of the remaining"
"2658","Shareholders of the Trust or of the applicable series or class."

"2708","proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative,"
"2709","or investigative and whether formal or informal before any court"
"2710","or administrative or legislative or other body, in which such"
"2711","Covered Person may be or may have been involved as a party or"
"2712","otherwise or with which such Covered Person may be or may have"
"2713","been threatened, while in office or thereafter, by reason of"
"2714","being or having been such a Covered Person except with respect to"
"2715","any matter as to which such Covered Person shall have been"
"2716","finally adjudicated in any such action, suit or other proceeding"
"2717","(a) not to have acted in good faith, (b) not to have acted in the"

"2721","proceeding, to have had reasonable cause to believe his or her"
"2722","action was unlawful or (d) to be liable to the Trust or its"
"2723","Shareholders by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross"
"2724","negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the"
"2725","conduct of such Covered Persons office (each of such exceptions"
"2726","being referred to hereinafter as  Disabling Conduct ).  Expenses,"

"2728","(but excluding amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in"
"2729","compromise or as fines or penalties), shall be paid from time to"

"2731","action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or"
"2732","on behalf of such Covered Person to repay amounts so paid to the"
"2733","Trust if it is ultimately determined that indemnification of such"
"2734","expenses is not authorized under this Article, provided, however,"
"2735","that either (a) such Covered Person shall have provided"
"2736","appropriate security for such undertaking, (b) the Trust shall be"
"2737","insured against losses arising from any such advance payments or"
"2738","(c) either a majority of the disinterested Trustees acting on the"
"2739","matter (provided that a majority of the disinterested Trustees"

"2742","of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial type"
"2743","inquiry) that there is reason to believe that such Covered Person"
"2744","will be found entitled to indemnification under this Article. In"
"2745","making any such determination, the disinterested Trustees or such"
"2746","counsel, as the case may be, shall afford the Covered Person a"
"2747","rebuttable presumption that the Covered Person did not engage in"
"2748","Disabling Conduct."
"2749","Compromise Payment"
"2750","      Section 2.	As to any matter disposed of (whether by a"
"2751","compromise payment, pursuant to a consent decree or otherwise)"
"2752","without an adjudication by a court, or by any other body before"
"2753","which the action, suit, or proceeding was brought, that such"
"2754","Covered Person engaged in Disabling Conduct, indemnification"
"2755","shall be provided if (a) approved as in the best interests of the"
"2756","Trust, after notice that it involves such indemnification, by at"
"2757","least a majority of the disinterested Trustees acting on the"
"2758","matter (provided that a majority of the disinterested Trustees"
"2759","then in office act on the matter) upon a determination, based"
"2760","upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full"
"2761","trial type inquiry) that such Covered Person did not engage in"
"2762","Disabling Conduct, or (b) there has been obtained an opinion in"
"2763","writing of independent legal counsel, based upon a review of"
"2764","readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial type inquiry)"
"2765","to the effect that such Covered Person did not engage in"
"2766","Disabling Conduct.  Any approval pursuant to this Section shall"
"2767","not prevent the recovery from any Covered Person of any amount"
"2768","paid to such Covered Person in accordance with this Section as"
"2769","indemnification if such Covered Person is subsequently"
"2770","adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction not to have"
"2771","engaged in Disabling Conduct."
"2772","Right Not Exclusive"
"2773","      Section 3.	The right of indemnification hereby provided shall"

"2787","be entitled by contract or otherwise under law, nor the power of"
"2788","the Trust to purchase and maintain liability insurance on behalf"

"3064","SUB-MANAGEMENT CONTRACT"
"3065","      This Sub-Management Contract is dated as of February 27,"
"3066","2014 between PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC, a Delaware"
"3067","limited liability company (the  Manager ) and PUTNAM INVESTMENTS"
"3068","LIMITED, a company organized under the laws of England and Wales"
"3069","(the  Sub-Manager )."
"3070","      WHEREAS, the Manager is the investment manager of each of"
"3071","the investment companies registered under the United States"
"3072","Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, that are identified"
"3073","on Schedule A hereto, as it may from time to time be amended by"
"3074","the Manager (the  Funds ), and a registered investment adviser"
"3075","under the United States Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as"
"3076","amended;"
"3077","      WHEREAS, the Sub-Manager is licensed as an investment"
"3078","manager by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom"
"3079","(the  FCA ); and"
"3080","      WHEREAS, the Manager desires to engage the Sub-Manager from"
"3081","time to time to manage a portion of certain of the Funds:"
"3082","      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants"
"3083","herein contained, it is agreed as follows:"
"3084","1.	SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY SUB-MANAGER."
"3085","      (a)	The Sub-Manager, at its expense, will furnish"
"3086","continuously an investment program for that portion of any Fund"
"3087","the management of which is allocated from time to time by the"
"3088","Manager to the Sub-Manager (an  Allocated Sleeve ). The Manager"
"3089","shall, in its sole discretion, determine which Funds will have an"
"3090","Allocated Sleeve and the amount of assets allocated from time to"
"3091","time to each such Allocated Sleeve; provided that, with respect"
"3092","to any Fund, the Trustees of such Fund must have approved the use"
"3093","of the Sub-Manager prior to the creation of an Allocated Sleeve"
"3094","for such Fund. The Sub-Manager will determine what investments"
"3095","shall be purchased, held, sold or exchanged by any Allocated"
"3096","Sleeve and what portion, if any, of the assets of the Allocated"
"3097","Sleeve shall be held uninvested and shall, on behalf of the Fund,"
"3098","make changes in the Funds investments held in such Allocated"
"3099","Sleeve."
"3100","      (b)	The Manager may also, at its discretion, request the"
"3101","Sub-Manager to provide assistance with purchasing and selling"
"3102","securities for any Fund, including the placement of orders with"
"3103","broker-dealers selected in accordance with Section 1(d), even if"
"3104","the Manager has not established an Allocated Sleeve for such"
"3105","Fund."
"3106","      (c)	The Sub-Manager at its expense will furnish all"
"3107","necessary investment and management facilities, including"
"3108","salaries of personnel, required for it to execute its duties"
"3109","faithfully."
"3110","      (d)	The Sub-Manager shall place all orders for the purchase"
"3111","and sale of portfolio investments for any Allocated Sleeve with"
"3112","brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Manager. In the selection"
"3113","of such brokers or dealers and the placing of such orders, the"
"3114","Sub-Manager shall use its best efforts to obtain for the related"
"3115","Fund the most favorable price and execution available, except to"
"3116","the extent it may be permitted to pay higher brokerage"
"3117","commissions for brokerage and research services as described"
"3118","below. In using its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the most"
"3119","favorable price and execution available, the Sub-Manager, bearing"
"3120","in mind the Funds best interests at all times, shall consider all"
"3121","factors it deems relevant, including by way of illustration,"
"3122","price, the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for"
"3123","the security, the amount of the commission, the timing of the"
"3124","transaction taking into account market prices and trends, the"
"3125","reputation, experience and financial stability of the broker or"
"3126","dealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the broker"
"3127","or dealer in other transactions. Subject to such policies as the"
"3128","Trustees of the Funds may determine, the Sub-Manager shall not be"
"3129","deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty"
"3130","created by this Contract or otherwise solely by reason of its"
"3131","having caused a Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides"
"3132","brokerage and research services to the Manager or the Sub-Manager"
"3133","an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"3134","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker"
"3135","or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if"
"3136","the Sub-Manager determines in good faith that such amount of"
"3137","commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"3138","brokerage and research services provided by such broker or"
"3139","dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"3140","its overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to"
"3141","other clients of the Manager or the Sub-Manager as to which the"
"3142","Manager or the Sub-Manager exercises investment discretion. The"
"3143","Sub-Manager agrees that in connection with purchases or sales of"
"3144","portfolio investments for any Fund, neither the Sub-Manager nor"
"3145","any officer, director, employee or agent of the Sub-Manager shall"
"3146","act as a principal or receive any commission other than as"
"3147","provided in Section 3."
"3148","      (e)	The Sub-Manager shall not be obligated to pay any"
"3149","expenses of or for the Manager or any Fund not expressly assumed"
"3150","by the Sub-Manager pursuant to this Section 1."
"3151","      (f)	In the performance of its duties, the Sub-Manager will"
"3152","comply with the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of"
"3153","Trust and By-Laws of each applicable Fund and such Funds stated"
"3154","investment objectives, policies and restrictions, and will use"
"3155","its best efforts to safeguard and promote the welfare of such"
"3156","Fund and to comply with other policies which the Manager or the"
"3157","Trustees may from time to time determine and shall exercise the"
"3158","same care and diligence expected of the Manager."
"3159","2.	OTHER AGREEMENTS, ETC."
"3160","      It is understood that any of the shareholders, Trustees,"
"3161","officers and employees of a Fund may be a shareholder, director,"
"3162","officer or employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the Sub-"
"3163","Manager, and in any person controlled by or under common control"
"3164","with the Sub-Manager, and that the Sub-Manager and any person"
"3165","controlled by or under common control with the Sub-Manager may"
"3166","have an interest in such Fund. It is also understood that the"
"3167","Sub-Manager and any person controlled by or under common control"
"3168","with the Sub-Manager have and may have advisory, management,"
"3169","service or other contracts with other organizations and persons,"
"3170","and may have other interests and business."
"3171","3.	COMPENSATION."
"3172","      Except as provided below, the Manager will pay to the Sub-"
"3173","Manager as compensation for the Sub-Managers services rendered, a"
"3174","fee, computed and paid quarterly at the annual rate of 0.35% per"
"3175","annum of average aggregate net asset value of the assets in"
"3176","equity and asset allocation Allocated Sleeves and 0.40% per annum"
"3177","of average aggregate net asset value of the assets in fixed"
"3178","income Allocated Sleeves, except for fixed income Allocated"
"3179","Sleeves in certain fixed income Funds enumerated as follows (with"
"3180","the per annum fee provided in parentheses): Putnam Money Market"
"3181","Liquidity Fund (0.20%), Putnam Short Term Investment Fund"
"3182","(0.20%), Putnam Money Market Fund (0.25%), Putnam Tax Exempt"
"3183","Money Market Fund (0.25%), Putnam VT Money Market Fund (0.25%),"
"3184","Putnam Short Duration Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam Short-Term"
"3185","Municipal Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam American Government Income"
"3186","Fund (0.25%), Putnam Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam U.S. Government"
"3187","Income Trust (0.25%), Putnam VT American Government Income Fund"
"3188","(0.25%), and Putnam VT Income Fund (0.25%)."
"3189","      Such average net asset value shall be determined by taking"
"3190","an average of all of the determinations of such net asset value"
"3191","during a quarter at the close of business on each business day"
"3192","during such quarter while this Contract is in effect. Such fee"
"3193","shall be payable for each quarter within 30 days after the close"
"3194","of such quarter. The Sub-Manager shall look only to the Manager"
"3195","for payment of its fees. No Fund shall have any responsibility"
"3196","for paying any fees due the Sub-Manager."
"3197","      With respect to each of Putnam High Income Securities Fund,"
"3198","Putnam Master Intermediate Income Trust and Putnam Premier Income"
"3199","Trust, the Manager will pay to the Sub-Manager as compensation"
"3200","for the Sub-Managers services rendered, a fee, computed and paid"
"3201","quarterly at the annual rate of 0.40% of Average Weekly Assets in"
"3202","Allocated Sleeves.  Average Weekly Assets  means the average of"
"3203","the weekly determinations of the difference between the total"
"3204","assets of the Fund (including any assets attributable to leverage"
"3205","for investment purposes) attributable to an Allocated Sleeve and"
"3206","the total liabilities of the Fund (excluding liabilities incurred"
"3207","in connection with leverage for investment purposes) attributable"
"3208","to such Allocated Sleeve, determined at the close of the last"
"3209","business day of each week, for each week which ends during the"
"3210","quarter. Such fee shall be payable for each quarter within 30"
"3211","days after the close of such quarter. As used in this Section 3,"
"3212","leverage for investment purposes  means any incurrence of"
"3213","indebtedness the proceeds of which are to be invested in"
"3214","accordance with the Funds investment objective. For purposes of"
"3215","calculating Average Weekly Assets, liabilities associated with"
"3216","any instruments or transactions used to leverage the Funds"
"3217","portfolio for investment purposes (whether or not such"
"3218","instruments or transactions are  covered  within the meaning of"
"3219","the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and regulations"
"3220","thereunder, giving effect to any interpretations of the"
"3221","Securities and Exchange Commission and its staff) are not"
"3222","considered liabilities. For purposes of calculating Average"
"3223","Weekly Assets, the total assets of the Fund will be deemed to"
"3224","include (a) any proceeds from the sale or transfer of an asset"
"3225","(the  Underlying Asset ) of the Fund to a counterparty in a"
"3226","reverse repurchase or dollar roll transaction and (b) the value"
"3227","of such Underlying Asset as of the relevant measuring date."
"3228","      In the event that the Managers management fee from any of"
"3229","Putnam High Income Securities Fund, Putnam Master Intermediate"
"3230","Income Trust or Putnam Premier Income Trust is reduced pursuant"
"3231","to the investment management contract between such Fund and the"
"3232","Manager because during any Measurement Period (as defined below)"
"3233","the amount of interest payments and fees with respect to"
"3234","indebtedness or other obligation of the Fund incurred for"
"3235","investment leverage purposes, plus additional expenses"
"3236","attributable to any such leverage for investment purposes,"
"3237","exceeds the portion of the Funds net income and net short-term"
"3238","capital gains (but not long-term capital gains) accruing during"
"3239","such Measurement Period as a result of the fact that such"
"3240","indebtedness or other obligation was outstanding during the"
"3241","Measurement Period, the fee payable to  the Sub-Manager with"
"3242","respect to such Fund shall be reduced in the same proportion as"
"3243","the fee paid to the Manager with respect to such Fund is so"
"3244","reduced.  Measurement Period  shall be any period for which"
"3245","payments of interest or fees (whether designated as such or"
"3246","implied) are payable in connection with any indebtedness or other"
"3247","obligation of the Fund incurred for investment purposes."
"3248","      If the Sub-Manager shall serve for less than the whole of a"
"3249","quarter, the foregoing compensation shall be prorated."
"3250","4.	ASSIGNMENT TERMINATES THIS CONTRACT; AMENDMENTS OF THIS"
"3251","CONTRACT."
"3252","      This Contract shall automatically terminate without the"
"3253","payment of any penalty, in the event of its assignment; and this"
"3254","Contract shall not be amended with respect to any Allocated"

"3256","vote, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of"
"3257","voting on such approval, of a majority of the Trustees of the"
"3258","related Fund who are not interested persons of such Fund or of"
"3259","the Manager."
"3260","5.	EFFECTIVE PERIOD AND TERMINATION OF THIS CONTRACT."
"3261","      This Contract shall become effective upon its execution, and"
"3262","shall remain in full force and effect continuously thereafter"
"3263","(unless terminated automatically as set forth in Section 4) until"
"3264","terminated as follows:"

"3270","      (b)	With respect to any Allocated Sleeve, if (i) the"
"3271","Trustees of the related Fund or the shareholders by the"

"3275","cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on"
"3276","such approval, do not specifically approve at least annually the"
"3277","continuance of this Contract, then this Contract shall"

"3279","anniversary of its execution, or upon the expiration of one year"
"3280","from the effective date of the last such continuance, whichever"
"3281","is later, or"
"3282","      (c)	With respect to any Allocated Sleeve, automatically"
"3283","upon termination of the Managers investment management contract"

"3537","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3538","To the Trustees of Putnam Asset Allocation Funds and Shareholders"
"3539","of Putnam Dynamic Asset Allocation Balanced Fund:"
"3540","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"3541","of Putnam Dynamic Asset Allocation Balanced Fund (the Fund) as of"
"3542","and for the year ended September 30, 2014, in accordance with the"
"3543","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"3544","States), we considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"3545","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"3546","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"3547","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"3548","with the requirements of Form N SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"3549","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal"
"3550","control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express"
"3551","an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"3552","financial reporting."
"3553","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"3554","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"3555","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3556","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"3557","related costs of controls.  A funds internal control over"
"3558","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"3559","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"3560","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"3561","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A funds"
"3562","internal control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"3563","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records"
"3564","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"3565","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"3566","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"3567","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3568","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that"
"3569","receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"3570","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"3571","fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"3572","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"3573","of a funds assets that could have a material effect on the"
"3574","financial statements."
"3575","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"3576","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"3577","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"3578","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3579","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"3580","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3581","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"3582","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"3583","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"3584","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely"
"3585","basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"3586","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"3587","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"3588","misstatement of the Funds annual or interim financial statements"
"3589","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3590","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"3591","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"3592","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"3593","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"3594","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"3595","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"3596","deficiencies in the Funds internal control over financial"
"3597","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"3598","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"3599","above as of September 30, 2014."

"3734","(including Vice President, which shall include the office of Executive"
"3735","Vice President), if any, as the Trustees from time to time may in"
"3736","their discretion elect.  The Trust may also have such agents as the"
"3737","Trustees from time to time may in their discretion appoint.  In"
"3738","addition, there shall be a Chair of the Trustees, who will be"
"3739","considered an officer of the Trustees and not of the Trust.  The Chair"
"3740","of the Trustees shall be a Trustee and may but need not be a"
"3741","Shareholder; and any other officer may but need not be a Trustee or a"
"3742","Shareholder.  Any two or more offices may be held by the same person."
"3743","       3.2  Election.  The Chair of the Trustees, the President, the"

"3749","Treasurer and the Clerk shall hold office in each case until he or she"
"3750","dies, resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified.  Each other officer"
"3751","shall hold office, and each agent shall retain authority, at the"
"3752","pleasure of the Trustees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the tenure of"
"3753","any officer of the Trust who is an employee or officer of the Trusts"
"3754","investment adviser or its affiliates shall automatically terminate"
"3755","contemporaneously with the termination of such persons employment"
"3756","with, or service as officer of, the Trusts investment adviser and all"
"3757","of its affiliates."
"3758","       3.4  Powers.  Subject to the other provisions of these Bylaws,"
"3759","each officer shall have, in addition to the duties and powers set"
"3760","forth in these Bylaws and in the Declaration of Trust, such duties and"
"3761","powers as are commonly incident to the office occupied by him or her"
"3762","as if the Trust were organized as a Massachusetts business corporation"
"3763","and such other duties and powers as the Trustees may from time to time"
"3764","designate."
"3765","       3.5  Chair.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide, the Chair of"

"3767","of the Trustees shall have such other duties and powers relating to"
"3768","the operations of the Trustees as the Trustees may from time to time"
"3769","designate, but shall have no individual authority to act for the Trust"
"3770","as an officer of the Trust.  The Trustees, including a majority of the"
"3771","Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust, as that term is"
"3772","defined in the 1940 Act, may appoint one or more persons to perform"
"3773","the duties of the Chair of the Trustees in the event of his or her"
"3774","absence at any meeting or in the event of his or her disability.  The"
"3775","Chair of the Trustees shall also have the power to appoint one or more"
"3776","persons to perform the duties of the Chair of the Trustees in the"
"3777","event of his or her absence at any meeting."
"3778","       3.6  President.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by vote or"
"3779","otherwise, the President shall be the principal executive officer of"
"3780","the Trust."
"3781","       3.7  Treasurer.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide by vote or"
"3782","otherwise, the Treasurer shall be the principal financial and"
"3783","accounting officer of the Trust, and shall, subject to the provisions"
"3784","of the Declaration of Trust and to any arrangement made by the"
"3785","Trustees with a custodian, investment adviser, subadviser or manager,"
"3786","or transfer, Shareholder servicing or similar agent, be in charge of"
"3787","the valuable papers, books of account and accounting records of the"
"3788","Trust, and shall have such other duties and powers as may be"
"3789","designated from time to time by the Trustees or by the principal"
"3790","executive officer of the Trust."
"3791","       3.8  Clerk.  The Clerk shall record all proceedings of the"
"3792","Shareholders and the Trustees in books to be kept therefor, which"
"3793","books or a copy thereof shall be kept at the principal office of the"
"3794","Trust.  In the absence of the Clerk from any meeting of the"
"3795","Shareholders or Trustees (or a Committee thereof), an Assistant Clerk,"
"3796","or if there be none or if he or she is absent, a temporary Clerk"
"3797","chosen at such meeting by the chair of such meeting, shall record the"
"3798","proceedings thereof in the aforesaid books."
"3799","       3.9  Resignations and Removals.  Any Trustee or officer may"
"3800","resign at any time by written instrument signed by him or her and"
"3801","delivered to the Chair of the Trustees, the President or the Clerk or"
"3802","to a meeting of the Trustees.  Such resignation shall be effective"
"3803","upon receipt unless specified to be effective at some other time.  The"
"3804","Trustees may remove any officer elected or appointed by them with or"

"4198","ARTICLE III"
"4199","Shares"
"4200","Division of Beneficial Interest"
"4201","       Section 1.	The number of Shares authorized shall be unlimited. The"
"4202","Shares of the Trust shall be issued in one or more series as the"
"4203","Trustees may, without shareholder approval, authorize.  Each series"
"4204","shall be preferred over all other series in respect of the assets"
"4205","allocated to that series within the meaning of the 1940 Act and shall"
"4206","represent a separate investment portfolio of the Trust.  The"
"4207","beneficial interest in each series shall at all times be divided into"
"4208","Shares, without par value unless otherwise determined by the Trustees,"
"4209","each of which shall, except as provided in the following sentence,"
"4210","represent an equal proportionate interest in the series with each"
"4211","other Share of the same series, none having priority or preference"
"4212","over another.  The Trustees may, without Shareholder approval, divide"
"4213","the Shares of any series into two or more classes, Shares of each such"
"4214","class having such preferences and special or relative rights and"
"4215","privileges (including conversion rights, if any) as the Trustees may"
"4216","determine and as shall be set forth in the Bylaws.  The Trustees may,"

"4218","Shares of any series or class into a greater or lesser number without"
"4219","thereby changing the proportionate beneficial interest in the series"
"4220","or class. The Trustees may also, without shareholder approval, from"
"4221","time to time combine the Shares or two or more classes of any series"
"4222","into a single class."
"4223","Ownership of Shares"
"4224","       Section 2.	The ownership of Shares shall be recorded on the books of"
"4225","the Trust or a transfer or similar agent.  No certificates certifying"
"4226","the ownership of Shares shall be issued except as the Trustees may"
"4227","otherwise determine from time to time.  The Trustees may make such"
"4228","rules as they consider appropriate for the issuance of Share"
"4229","certificates, the retirement of Share certificates, the transfer of"
"4230","Shares and similar matters.  The record books of the Trust as kept by"
"4231","the Trust or any transfer or similar agent, as the case may be, shall"
"4232","be conclusive as to who are the Shareholders of each series and class"
"4233","and as to the number of Shares of each series and class held from time"
"4234","to time by each Shareholder."
"4235","Investment in the Trust"

"4243","exchange or liquidation thereof, and any funds or payments derived"
"4244","from any reinvestment of such proceeds in whatever form the same may"
"4245","be, shall irrevocably belong to the series of Shares with respect to"
"4246","which the same were received by the Trust for all purposes, subject"
"4247","only to the rights of creditors, and shall be so handled upon the"
"4248","books of account of the Trust and are herein referred to as assets of"
"4249","such series."
"4250","No Preemptive Rights"
"4251","       Section 4.	Shareholders shall have no preemptive or other right to"
"4252","subscribe to any additional Shares or other securities issued by the"
"4253","Trust."

"4265","of Shares shall not entitle the Shareholder to any title in or to the"
"4266","whole or any part of the Trust property or right to call for a"
"4267","partition or division of the same or for an accounting, nor shall the"
"4268","ownership of Shares constitute the Shareholders partners.  Neither the"
"4269","Trust nor the Trustees, nor any officer, employee or agent of the"
"4270","Trust shall have any power to bind personally any Shareholder, nor"
"4271","except as specifically provided herein to call upon any Shareholder"

"4276","maintain any court action, proceeding or claim on behalf of the Trust"
"4277","without first making demand on the Trustees requesting the Trustees to"

"4567","series or class entitled to vote shall be necessary to constitute a"
"4568","quorum for the transaction of business by that series or class.  Any"
"4569","lesser number shall be sufficient for adjournments.  Any adjourned"
"4570","session or sessions may be held, within a reasonable time after the"
"4571","date set for the original meeting, without the necessity of further"
"4572","notice.  Except when a larger vote is required by any provision of law"
"4573","or of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws, a majority of the"
"4574","Shares voted shall decide any questions and a plurality shall elect a"
"4575","Trustee, provided that where any provision of law or of this"
"4576","Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws requires that the holders of any"
"4577","series or class shall vote as an individual series or class then a"
"4578","majority of the Shares of that series or class voted on the matter (or"
"4579","a plurality with respect to the election of a Trustee) shall decide"
"4580","that matter insofar as that series or class is concerned."
"4581","Action by Written Consent"
"4582","       Section 4.	Any action taken by Shareholders may be taken without a"
"4583","meeting if a majority of Shareholders entitled to vote on the matter"
"4584","(or such larger proportion thereof as shall be required by any express"
"4585","provision of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws) consent to the"
"4586","action in writing and such written consents are filed with the records"
"4587","of the meetings of Shareholders.  Such consent shall be treated for"
"4588","all purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of Shareholders."
"4589","Additional Provisions"
"4590","       Section 5.	The Bylaws may include further provisions, not"
"4591","inconsistent with this Declaration of Trust, regarding Shareholders"
"4592","voting powers, the conduct of meetings and related matters."
"4593","ARTICLE VI"
"4594","Distributions, Redemptions and Repurchases"
"4595","Distributions"
"4596","       Section 1.	The Trustees may each year, or more frequently if they so"
"4597","determine, distribute to the Shareholders of each series out of the"
"4598","assets of such series such amounts as the Trustees may determine.  Any"
"4599","such distribution to the Shareholders of a particular series shall be"
"4600","made to said Shareholders pro rata in proportion to the number of"
"4601","Shares of such series held by each of them, except to the extent"
"4602","otherwise required or permitted by the preferences and special or"
"4603","relative rights and privileges of any classes of Shares of that"
"4604","Series, and any distribution to the Shareholders of a particular class"
"4605","of Shares shall be made to such Shareholders pro rata in proportion to"
"4606","the number of Shares of such class held by each of them.  Such"
"4607","distributions shall be made in cash, Shares or other property, or a"
"4608","combination thereof, as determined by the Trustees.  Any such"
"4609","distribution paid in Shares will be paid at the net asset value"
"4610","thereof as determined in accordance with the Bylaws."
"4611","Redemptions and Repurchases"
"4612","       Section 2.	The Trust shall purchase such Shares as are offered by"
"4613","any Shareholder for redemption, upon the presentation of any"
"4614","certificate for the Shares to be purchased, a proper instrument of"
"4615","transfer and a request directed to the Trust or a person designated by"
"4616","the Trust that the Trust purchase such Shares, or in accordance with"
"4617","such other procedures for redemption as the Trustees may from time to"
"4618","time authorize; and the Trust will pay therefor the net asset value"
"4619","thereof, as next determined in accordance with the Bylaws, less any"
"4620","redemption charge fixed by the Trustees.  Payment for said Shares"
"4621","shall be made by the Trust to the Shareholder within seven days after"
"4622","the date on which the request is made.  The obligation set forth in"
"4623","this Section 2 is subject to the provision that in the event that at"
"4624","any time the New York Stock Exchange is closed for other than"
"4625","customary weekends or holidays, or, if permitted by rules of the"
"4626","Securities and Exchange Commission, during periods when trading on the"
"4627","Exchange is restricted or during any emergency which makes it"
"4628","impractical for the Trust to dispose of its investments or to"
"4629","determine fairly the value of its net assets, or during any other"
"4630","period permitted by order of the Securities and Exchange Commission"
"4631","for the protection of investors, such obligation may be suspended or"
"4632","postponed by the Trustees.  The Trust may also purchase or repurchase"
"4633","Shares at a price not exceeding the net asset value of such Shares in"
"4634","effect when the purchase or repurchase or any contract to purchase or"
"4635","repurchase is made.  Payment for any redemption, purchase or"
"4636","repurchase may be made in cash or, except to the extent prohibited by"
"4637","the laws of any jurisdiction in which Shares are registered for sale,"
"4638","in other property, or any combination thereof.  The composition of any"
"4639","such payment shall be determined by the Trust in its sole discretion,"
"4640","and the Trust shall have no obligation to effect a pro rata division"
"4641","of cash or other property in making any such payment.  In no event"
"4642","shall the Trust be liable for any delay of any other person in"
"4643","transferring securities or other property selected for delivery as all"
"4644","or part of any such payment."
"4645","Redemption at the Option of the Trust"
"4646","       Section 3.	The Trust shall have the right at its option and at any"
"4647","time to redeem Shares of any Shareholder at the net asset value"
"4648","thereof as determined in accordance with the Bylaws: (i) if at such"
"4649","time such Shareholder owns fewer Shares than, or Shares having an"
"4650","aggregate net asset value of less than, an amount determined from time"
"4651","to time by the Trustees, in which case the Trust may redeem all Shares"
"4652","owned by such Shareholder or only so many of such Shares as may be"
"4653","required to compensate the Trust for any fee fixed from time to time"
"4654","by the Trustees for the maintenance of small accounts; (ii) to the"
"4655","extent that such Shareholder owns Shares of a particular series of"
"4656","Shares equal to or in excess of a percentage of the outstanding Shares"
"4657","of that series determined from time to time by the Trustees; (iii) to"
"4658","the extent that such Shareholder owns Shares of the Trust representing"
"4659","a percentage equal to or in excess of such percentage of the aggregate"
"4660","number of outstanding Shares of the Trust or the aggregate net asset"
"4661","value of the Trust determined from time to time by the Trustees; (iv)"
"4662","if such Shareholder fails to supply appropriate personal and tax"
"4663","identification information requested by the Trust; (v) if such"
"4664","Shareholder fails to meet or maintain the qualifications for ownership"
"4665","of a particular series or class; or (vi) if the Trustees determine for"
"4666","any other reason, in their sole discretion, that the ownership of"
"4667","Shares by a Shareholder is not in the best interests of the remaining"
"4668","Shareholders of the Trust or of the applicable series or class."
"4669","ARTICLE VII"
"4670","Compensation and Limitation of Liability of Trustees"
"4671","Compensation"
"4672","       Section 1.	The Trustees as such shall be entitled to reasonable"
"4673","compensation from the Trust; they may fix the amount of their"
"4674","compensation.  Nothing herein shall in any way prevent the employment"
"4675","of any Trustee for advisory, management, legal, accounting, investment"
"4676","banking or other services and payment for the same by the Trust."
"4677","Limitation of Liability"
"4678","       Section 2.	A Trustee shall be liable for his or her own willful"
"4679","misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the"
"4680","duties involved in the conduct of the office of Trustee, and for"
"4681","nothing else.  The Trustees shall not be responsible or liable in any"
"4682","event for any neglect or wrongdoing of any officer, agent, employee,"
"4683","manager or principal underwriter of the Trust, nor shall any Trustee"
"4684","be responsible for the act or omission of any other Trustee. The"
"4685","appointment, designation or identification of a Trustee as an officer"
"4686","of the Trustees or of any committee of the Trustees, or as an expert"
"4687","with respect to certain matters (including without limitation"
"4688","identification of a Trustee as an audit committee financial expert)"
"4689","shall not impose on that person any duty, obligation or liability that"
"4690","is greater than the duties, obligations and liabilities imposed on"
"4691","that person as a Trustee in the absence of such appointment,"
"4692","designation or identification, and no Trustee who has special skills"
"4693","or expertise or who is appointed, designated of identified as"
"4694","aforesaid, shall be held to a higher standard of care by virtue"
"4695","thereof or be limited in any way with respect to any right or"
"4696","privilege to which such person would otherwise be entitled as a"
"4697","Trustee hereunder, including without limitation the right of"
"4698","indemnification. Nothing herein contained shall protect any Trustee"
"4699","against any liability to which he or she would otherwise be subject by"
"4700","reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless"
"4701","disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office."
"4702","ARTICLE VIII"
"4703","Indemnification"
"4704","Trustees, Officers, etc."
"4705","       Section 1.	The Trust shall indemnify each of its Trustees and"
"4706","officers (including persons who serve at the Trusts request as"
"4707","directors, officers or trustees of another organization in which the"
"4708","Trust has any interest as a shareholder, creditor or otherwise)"
"4709","(hereinafter referred to as a Covered Person) against all liabilities"
"4710","and expenses, including but not limited to amounts paid in"
"4711","satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as fines and penalties,"
"4712","and counsel fees reasonably incurred by any Covered Person in"
"4713","connection with the defense or disposition of any threatened, pending,"
"4714","or contemplated action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,"
"4715","administrative, arbitrative, or investigative and whether formal or"
"4716","informal before any court or administrative or legislative or other"
"4717","body, in which such Covered Person may be or may have been involved as"
"4718","a party or otherwise or with which such Covered Person may be or may"
"4719","have been threatened, while in office or thereafter, by reason of"
"4720","being or having been such a Covered Person except with respect to any"
"4721","matter as to which such Covered Person shall have been finally"
"4722","adjudicated in any such action, suit or other proceeding (a) not to"
"4723","have acted in good faith, (b) not to have acted in the reasonable"
"4724","belief that such Covered Persons action was in the best interests of"
"4725","the Trust or at least was not opposed to the best interests of the"
"4726","Trust, (c) in the case of a criminal proceeding, to have had"
"4727","reasonable cause to believe his or her action was unlawful or (d) to"
"4728","be liable to the Trust or its Shareholders by reason of willful"
"4729","misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the"
"4730","duties involved in the conduct of such Covered Persons office (each of"
"4731","such exceptions being referred to hereinafter as Disabling Conduct)."
"4732","Expenses, including counsel fees so incurred by any such Covered"
"4733","Person (but excluding amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in"
"4734","compromise or as fines or penalties), shall be paid from time to time"
"4735","by the Trust in advance of the final disposition of any such action,"
"4736","suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of"
"4737","such Covered Person to repay amounts so paid to the Trust if it is"
"4738","ultimately determined that indemnification of such expenses is not"
"4739","authorized under this Article, provided, however, that either (a) such"
"4740","Covered Person shall have provided appropriate security for such"
"4741","undertaking, (b) the Trust shall be insured against losses arising"
"4742","from any such advance payments or (c) either a majority of the"
"4743","disinterested Trustees acting on the matter (provided that a majority"
"4744","of the disinterested Trustees then in office act on the matter), or"
"4745","independent legal counsel in a written opinion, shall have determined,"
"4746","based upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full"
"4747","trial type inquiry) that there is reason to believe that such Covered"
"4748","Person will be found entitled to indemnification under this Article."
"4749","In making any such determination, the disinterested Trustees or such"
"4750","counsel, as the case may be, shall afford the Covered Person a"
"4751","rebuttable presumption that the Covered Person did not engage in"
"4752","Disabling Conduct."
"4753","Compromise Payment"
"4754","       Section 2.	As to any matter disposed of (whether by a compromise"
"4755","payment, pursuant to a consent decree or otherwise) without an"
"4756","adjudication by a court, or by any other body before which the action,"
"4757","suit, or proceeding was brought, that such Covered Person engaged in"
"4758","Disabling Conduct, indemnification shall be provided if (a) approved"
"4759","as in the best interests of the Trust, after notice that it involves"
"4760","such indemnification, by at least a majority of the disinterested"
"4761","Trustees acting on the matter (provided that a majority of the"
"4762","disinterested Trustees then in office act on the matter) upon a"
"4763","determination, based upon a review of readily available facts (as"
"4764","opposed to a full trial type inquiry) that such Covered Person did not"
"4765","engage in Disabling Conduct, or (b) there has been obtained an opinion"
"4766","in writing of independent legal counsel, based upon a review of"
"4767","readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial type inquiry) to"
"4768","the effect that such Covered Person did not engage in Disabling"
"4769","Conduct.  Any approval pursuant to this Section shall not prevent the"
"4770","recovery from any Covered Person of any amount paid to such Covered"
"4771","Person in accordance with this Section as indemnification if such"
"4772","Covered Person is subsequently adjudicated by a court of competent"
"4773","jurisdiction not to have engaged in Disabling Conduct."
"4774","Right Not Exclusive"
"4775","       Section 3.	The right of indemnification hereby provided shall not be"
"4776","exclusive of or affect any other rights to which such Covered Person"
"4777","may be entitled.  As used in this Article VIII, the term Covered"
"4778","Person shall include such persons heirs, executors and administrators"
"4779","and a disinterested Trustee is a Trustee who is not an interested"
"4780","person of the Trust as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (or"
"4781","who has been exempted from being an interested person by any rule,"
"4782","regulation or order of the Securities and Exchange Commission) and"
"4783","against whom none of such actions, suits or other proceedings or"
"4784","another action, suit or other proceeding on the same or similar"
"4785","grounds is then or has been pending.  Nothing contained in this"
"4786","Article shall affect any rights to indemnification to which personnel"
"4787","of the Trust, other than Trustees or officers, and other persons may"
"4788","be entitled by contract or otherwise under law, nor the power of the"
"4789","Trust to purchase and maintain liability insurance on behalf of any"
"4790","such person."
"4791","Shareholders"
"4792","       Section 4.	In case any Shareholder or former Shareholder shall be"
"4793","held to be personally liable solely by reason of his or her being or"
"4794","having been a Shareholder and not because of his or her acts or"
"4795","omissions or for some other reason, the Shareholder or former"
"4796","Shareholder (or his or her heirs, executors, administrators or other"
"4797","legal representative or in the case of a corporation or other entity,"
"4798","its corporate or other general successor) shall be entitled to be held"
"4799","harmless from and indemnified against all loss and expense arising"
"4800","from such liability, but only out of the assets of the particular"
"4801","series of Shares of which he or she is or was a Shareholder."

"4809","particular series of Shares for payment under such credit, contract or"
"4810","claim, and neither the Shareholders nor the Trustees, nor any of the"
"4811","Trusts officers, employees or agents, whether past, present or future,"
"4812","shall be personally liable therefor."
"4813","       Every note, bond, contract, instrument, certificate or"
"4814","undertaking and every other act or thing whatsoever executed or done"
"4815","by any Trustee, officer, employee or agent on behalf of the Trust or"
"4816","the Trustees or any of them in connection with the Trust shall be"
"4817","conclusively deemed to have been executed or done only in or with"
"4818","respect to such persons capacity as a Trustee, officer, employee or"
"4819","agent, and such person shall not be personally liable thereon."
"4820","       Every note, bond, contract, instrument, certificate or"

"4832","officer, employee or agent or the Shareholders individually."
"4833","Trustees Faith Actions Binding; Expert Advice; No Bond or Surety"
"4834","       Section 2. The exercise by the Trustees of their powers and"
"4835","discretions hereunder shall be binding upon everyone interested. The"
"4836","Trustees may take advice of counsel or other experts with respect to"
"4837","the meaning and operation of this Declaration of Trust, and shall be"
"4838","under no liability for any act or omission taken in accordance with"
"4839","such advice or for failing to follow such advice. The Trustees shall"
"4840","not be required to give any bond as such, nor any surety if a bond is"
"4841","required."
"4842","Liability of Third Persons Dealing with Trustee"
"4843","       Section 3. No person dealing with the Trustees shall be bound to"
"4844","make any inquiry concerning the validity of any transaction made or to"

"5052","SUB MANAGEMENT CONTRACT"
"5053","       This Sub Management Contract is dated as of February 27, 2014"
"5054","between PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC, a Delaware limited liability"
"5055","company (the Manager) and PUTNAM INVESTMENTS LIMITED, a company organized"
"5056","under the laws of England and Wales (the Sub Manager)."
"5057","       WHEREAS, the Manager is the investment manager of each of the"
"5058","investment companies registered under the United States Investment"
"5059","Company Act of 1940, as amended, that are identified on Schedule A"
"5060","hereto, as it may from time to time be amended by the Manager (the"
"5061","Funds), and a registered investment adviser under the United States"
"5062","Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended;"
"5063","       WHEREAS, the Sub Manager is licensed as an investment manager by"
"5064","the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (the FCA); and"
"5065","       WHEREAS, the Manager desires to engage the Sub Manager from time to"
"5066","time to manage a portion of certain of the Funds:"
"5067","       NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein"
"5068","contained, it is agreed as follows:"
"5069","1.	SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY SUB MANAGER."
"5070","       (a)	The Sub Manager, at its expense, will furnish continuously an"
"5071","investment program for that portion of any Fund the management of which"
"5072","is allocated from time to time by the Manager to the Sub Manager (an"
"5073","Allocated Sleeve). The Manager shall, in its sole discretion, determine"
"5074","which Funds will have an Allocated Sleeve and the amount of assets"
"5075","allocated from time to time to each such Allocated Sleeve; provided that,"
"5076","with respect to any Fund, the Trustees of such Fund must have approved"
"5077","the use of the Sub Manager prior to the creation of an Allocated Sleeve"
"5078","for such Fund. The Sub Manager will determine what investments shall be"
"5079","purchased, held, sold or exchanged by any Allocated Sleeve and what"
"5080","portion, if any, of the assets of the Allocated Sleeve shall be held"
"5081","uninvested and shall, on behalf of the Fund, make changes in the Funds"
"5082","investments held in such Allocated Sleeve."
"5083","       (b)	The Manager may also, at its discretion, request the Sub"
"5084","Manager to provide assistance with purchasing and selling securities for"
"5085","any Fund, including the placement of orders with broker dealers selected"
"5086","in accordance with Section 1(d), even if the Manager has not established"
"5087","an Allocated Sleeve for such Fund."
"5088","       (c)	The Sub Manager at its expense will furnish all necessary"
"5089","investment and management facilities, including salaries of personnel,"
"5090","required for it to execute its duties faithfully."
"5091","       (d)	The Sub Manager shall place all orders for the purchase and"
"5092","sale of portfolio investments for any Allocated Sleeve with brokers or"
"5093","dealers selected by the Sub Manager. In the selection of such brokers or"
"5094","dealers and the placing of such orders, the Sub Manager shall use its"
"5095","best efforts to obtain for the related Fund the most favorable price and"
"5096","execution available, except to the extent it may be permitted to pay"
"5097","higher brokerage commissions for brokerage and research services as"
"5098","described below. In using its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the"
"5099","most favorable price and execution available, the Sub Manager, bearing in"
"5100","mind the Funds best interests at all times, shall consider all factors it"
"5101","deems relevant, including by way of illustration, price, the size of the"
"5102","transaction, the nature of the market for the security, the amount of the"
"5103","commission, the timing of the transaction taking into account market"
"5104","prices and trends, the reputation, experience and financial stability of"
"5105","the broker or dealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the"
"5106","broker or dealer in other transactions. Subject to such policies as the"
"5107","Trustees of the Funds may determine, the Sub Manager shall not be deemed"
"5108","to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this"
"5109","Contract or otherwise solely by reason of its having caused a Fund to pay"
"5110","a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to the"
"5111","Manager or the Sub Manager an amount of commission for effecting a"
"5112","portfolio investment transaction in excess of the amount of commission"
"5113","another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that"
"5114","transaction, if the Sub Manager determines in good faith that such amount"
"5115","of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage"
"5116","and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in terms"
"5117","of either that particular transaction or its overall responsibilities"
"5118","with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the Manager or the Sub"
"5119","Manager as to which the Manager or the Sub Manager exercises investment"
"5120","discretion. The Sub Manager agrees that in connection with purchases or"
"5121","sales of portfolio investments for any Fund, neither the Sub Manager nor"
"5122","any officer, director, employee or agent of the Sub Manager shall act as"
"5123","a principal or receive any commission other than as provided in Section"
"5124","3."
"5125","       (e)	The Sub Manager shall not be obligated to pay any expenses of"
"5126","or for the Manager or any Fund not expressly assumed by the Sub Manager"
"5127","pursuant to this Section 1."
"5128","       (f)	In the performance of its duties, the Sub Manager will comply"
"5129","with the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust and By Laws"
"5130","of each applicable Fund and such Funds stated investment objectives,"
"5131","policies and restrictions, and will use its best efforts to safeguard and"
"5132","promote the welfare of such Fund and to comply with other policies which"
"5133","the Manager or the Trustees may from time to time determine and shall"
"5134","exercise the same care and diligence expected of the Manager."
"5135","2.	OTHER AGREEMENTS, ETC."
"5136","       It is understood that any of the shareholders, Trustees, officers"
"5137","and employees of a Fund may be a shareholder, director, officer or"
"5138","employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the Sub Manager, and in any"
"5139","person controlled by or under common control with the Sub Manager, and"
"5140","that the Sub Manager and any person controlled by or under common control"
"5141","with the Sub Manager may have an interest in such Fund. It is also"
"5142","understood that the Sub Manager and any person controlled by or under"
"5143","common control with the Sub Manager have and may have advisory,"
"5144","management, service or other contracts with other organizations and"
"5145","persons, and may have other interests and business."
"5146","3.	COMPENSATION."
"5147","       Except as provided below, the Manager will pay to the Sub Manager"
"5148","as compensation for the Sub Managers services rendered, a fee, computed"
"5149","and paid quarterly at the annual rate of 0.35% per annum of average"
"5150","aggregate net asset value of the assets in equity and asset allocation"
"5151","Allocated Sleeves and 0.40% per annum of average aggregate net asset"
"5152","value of the assets in fixed income Allocated Sleeves, except for fixed"
"5153","income Allocated Sleeves in certain fixed income Funds enumerated as"
"5154","follows (with the per annum fee provided in parentheses): Putnam Money"
"5155","Market Liquidity Fund (0.20%), Putnam Short Term Investment Fund (0.20%),"
"5156","Putnam Money Market Fund (0.25%), Putnam Tax Exempt Money Market Fund"
"5157","(0.25%), Putnam VT Money Market Fund (0.25%), Putnam Short Duration"
"5158","Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam Short Term Municipal Income Fund (0.25%),"
"5159","Putnam American Government Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam Income Fund"
"5160","(0.25%), Putnam U.S. Government Income Trust (0.25%), Putnam VT American"
"5161","Government Income Fund (0.25%), and Putnam VT Income Fund (0.25%)."
"5162","       Such average net asset value shall be determined by taking an"
"5163","average of all of the determinations of such net asset value during a"
"5164","quarter at the close of business on each business day during such quarter"
"5165","while this Contract is in effect. Such fee shall be payable for each"
"5166","quarter within 30 days after the close of such quarter. The Sub Manager"
"5167","shall look only to the Manager for payment of its fees. No Fund shall"
"5168","have any responsibility for paying any fees due the Sub Manager."
"5169","       With respect to each of Putnam High Income Securities Fund, Putnam"
"5170","Master Intermediate Income Trust and Putnam Premier Income Trust, the"
"5171","Manager will pay to the Sub Manager as compensation for the Sub Managers"
"5172","services rendered, a fee, computed and paid quarterly at the annual rate"
"5173","of 0.40% of Average Weekly Assets in Allocated Sleeves. Average Weekly"
"5174","Assets means the average of the weekly determinations of the difference"
"5175","between the total assets of the Fund (including any assets attributable"
"5176","to leverage for investment purposes) attributable to an Allocated Sleeve"
"5177","and the total liabilities of the Fund (excluding liabilities incurred in"
"5178","connection with leverage for investment purposes) attributable to such"
"5179","Allocated Sleeve, determined at the close of the last business day of"
"5180","each week, for each week which ends during the quarter. Such fee shall be"
"5181","payable for each quarter within 30 days after the close of such quarter."
"5182","As used in this Section 3, leverage for investment purposes means any"
"5183","incurrence of indebtedness the proceeds of which are to be invested in"
"5184","accordance with the Funds investment objective. For purposes of"
"5185","calculating Average Weekly Assets, liabilities associated with any"
"5186","instruments or transactions used to leverage the Funds portfolio for"
"5187","investment purposes (whether or not such instruments or transactions are"
"5188","covered within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the"
"5189","rules and regulations thereunder, giving effect to any interpretations of"
"5190","the Securities and Exchange Commission and its staff) are not considered"
"5191","liabilities. For purposes of calculating Average Weekly Assets, the total"
"5192","assets of the Fund will be deemed to include (a) any proceeds from the"
"5193","sale or transfer of an asset (the Underlying Asset) of the Fund to a"
"5194","counterparty in a reverse repurchase or dollar roll transaction and (b)"
"5195","the value of such Underlying Asset as of the relevant measuring date."
"5196","       In the event that the Managers management fee from any of Putnam"
"5197","High Income Securities Fund, Putnam Master Intermediate Income Trust or"
"5198","Putnam Premier Income Trust is reduced pursuant to the investment"
"5199","management contract between such Fund and the Manager because during any"
"5200","Measurement Period (as defined below) the amount of interest payments and"
"5201","fees with respect to indebtedness or other obligation of the Fund"
"5202","incurred for investment leverage purposes, plus additional expenses"
"5203","attributable to any such leverage for investment purposes, exceeds the"
"5204","portion of the Funds net income and net short term capital gains (but not"
"5205","long term capital gains) accruing during such Measurement Period as a"
"5206","result of the fact that such indebtedness or other obligation was"
"5207","outstanding during the Measurement Period, the fee payable to  the Sub"
"5208","Manager with respect to such Fund shall be reduced in the same proportion"
"5209","as the fee paid to the Manager with respect to such Fund is so reduced."
"5210","Measurement Period shall be any period for which payments of interest or"
"5211","fees (whether designated as such or implied) are payable in connection"
"5212","with any indebtedness or other obligation of the Fund incurred for"
"5213","investment purposes."
"5214","       If the Sub Manager shall serve for less than the whole of a"
"5215","quarter, the foregoing compensation shall be prorated."
"5216","4.	ASSIGNMENT TERMINATES THIS CONTRACT; AMENDMENTS OF THIS CONTRACT."
"5217","       This Contract shall automatically terminate without the payment of"
"5218","any penalty, in the event of its assignment; and this Contract shall not"
"5219","be amended with respect to any Allocated Sleeve unless such amendment be"
"5220","approved at a meeting by the vote, cast in person at a meeting called for"
"5221","the purpose of voting on such approval, of a majority of the Trustees of"
"5222","the related Fund who are not interested persons of such Fund or of the"
"5223","Manager."
"5224","5.	EFFECTIVE PERIOD AND TERMINATION OF THIS CONTRACT."
"5225","       This Contract shall become effective upon its execution, and shall"
"5226","remain in full force and effect continuously thereafter (unless"
"5227","terminated automatically as set forth in Section 4) until terminated as"
"5228","follows:"
"5229","       (a)	Either party hereto or, with respect to any Allocated Sleeve,"
"5230","the related Fund may at any time terminate this Contract by not more than"
"5231","sixty days nor less than thirty days written notice delivered or mailed"
"5232","by registered mail, postage prepaid, to the other party, or"
"5233","       (b)	With respect to any Allocated Sleeve, if (i) the Trustees of"
"5234","the related Fund or the shareholders by the affirmative vote of a"
"5235","majority of the outstanding shares of such Fund, and (ii) a majority of"
"5236","the Trustees of such Fund who are not interested persons of such Fund or"
"5237","of the Manager, by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the"
"5238","purpose of voting on such approval, do not specifically approve at least"
"5239","annually the continuance of this Contract, then this Contract shall"
"5240","automatically terminate at the close of business on the anniversary of"
"5241","its execution, or upon the expiration of one year from the effective date"
"5242","of the last such continuance, whichever is later, or"
"5243","       (c)	With respect to any Allocated Sleeve, automatically upon"
"5244","termination of the Managers investment management contract with the"
"5245","related Fund."
"5246","       Action by a Fund under (a) above may be taken either (i) by vote of"
"5247","a majority of its Trustees, or (ii) by the affirmative vote of a majority"
"5248","of the outstanding shares of such Fund."
"5249","       Termination of this Contract pursuant to this Section 5 will be"
"5250","without the payment of any penalty."
"5251","6.	CERTAIN DEFINITIONS."
"5252","       For the purposes of this Contract, the affirmative vote of a"
"5253","majority of the outstanding shares of a Fund means the affirmative vote,"
"5254","at a duly called and held meeting of shareholders of such Fund, (a) of"
"5255","the holders of 67% or more of the shares of such Fund present (in person"
"5256","or by proxy) and entitled to vote at such meeting, if the holders of more"
"5257","than 50% of the outstanding shares of such Fund entitled to vote at such"
"5258","meeting are present in person or by proxy, or (b) of the holders of more"
"5259","than 50% of the outstanding shares of such Fund entitled to vote at such"
"5260","meeting, whichever is less."
"5261","       For the purposes of this Contract, the terms affiliated person,"
"5262","control, interested person and assignment shall have their respective"
"5263","meanings defined in the United States Investment Company Act of 1940 and"
"5264","the Rules and Regulations thereunder (the 1940 Act), subject, however, to"
"5265","such exemptions as may be granted by the Securities and Exchange"

"5269","services shall have the meaning given in the United States Securities"
"5270","Exchange Act of 1934 and the Rules and Regulations thereunder."

"5491","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"5492","To the Trustees of Putnam Asset Allocation Funds and"
"5493","Shareholders of Putnam Dynamic Asset Allocation Conservative"
"5494","Fund:"
"5495","In planning and performing our audit of the financial"
"5496","statements of Putnam Dynamic Asset Allocation Conservative"
"5497","Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year ended September 30,"
"5498","2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"5499","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the"
"5500","Funds internal control over financial reporting, including"
"5501","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"5502","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"5503","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"5504","comply with the requirements of Form N SAR, but not for the"
"5505","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"5506","Funds internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly,"
"5507","we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
"5508","internal control over financial reporting."
"5509","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"5510","maintaining effective internal control over financial"
"5511","reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"5512","judgments by management are required to assess the expected"
"5513","benefits and related costs of controls.  A funds internal"
"5514","control over financial reporting is a process designed to"
"5515","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"5516","financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"5517","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"5518","accepted accounting principles.  A funds internal control over"
"5519","financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"5520","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"5521","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"5522","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"5523","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"5524","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"5525","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"5526","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"5527","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees"
"5528","of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"5529","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"5530","use or disposition of a funds assets that could have a"
"5531","material effect on the financial statements."
"5532","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"5533","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"5534","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"5535","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"5536","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"5537","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"5538","deteriorate."
"5539","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"5540","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"5541","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"5542","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"5543","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a"
"5544","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"5545","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"5546","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"5547","Funds annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"5548","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"5549","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial"
"5550","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"5551","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"5552","in internal control over financial reporting that might be"
"5553","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public"
"5554","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"5555","we noted no deficiencies in the Funds internal control over"
"5556","financial reporting and its operation, including controls over"
"5557","safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material"
"5558","weaknesses as defined above as of September 30, 2014."

"5680","of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each"
"5681","other at the same time and participation by such means shall"

"5697","ARTICLE 3"
"5698","Officers"

"5701","officers (including Vice President, which shall include the"

"5735","      3.5  Chair.  Unless the Trustees otherwise provide, the"

"6624","Distributions, Redemptions and Repurchases"
"6625","Distributions"
"6626","      Section 1.	The Trustees may each year, or more frequently if"
"6627","they so determine, distribute to the Shareholders of each series"
"6628","out of the assets of such series such amounts as the Trustees may"
"6629","determine.  Any such distribution to the Shareholders of a"
"6630","particular series shall be made to said Shareholders pro rata in"
"6631","proportion to the number of Shares of such series held by each of"
"6632","them, except to the extent otherwise required or permitted by the"
"6633","preferences and special or relative rights and privileges of any"
"6634","classes of Shares of that Series, and any distribution to the"
"6635","Shareholders of a particular class of Shares shall be made to"
"6636","such Shareholders pro rata in proportion to the number of Shares"
"6637","of such class held by each of them.  Such distributions shall be"
"6638","made in cash, Shares or other property, or a combination thereof,"
"6639","as determined by the Trustees.  Any such distribution paid in"
"6640","Shares will be paid at the net asset value thereof as determined"
"6641","in accordance with the Bylaws."
"6642","Redemptions and Repurchases"
"6643","      Section 2.	The Trust shall purchase such Shares as are offered"
"6644","by any Shareholder for redemption, upon the presentation of any"

"6647","designated by the Trust that the Trust purchase such Shares, or"
"6648","in accordance with such other procedures for redemption as the"
"6649","Trustees may from time to time authorize; and the Trust will pay"
"6650","therefor the net asset value thereof, as next determined in"
"6651","accordance with the Bylaws, less any redemption charge fixed by"
"6652","the Trustees.  Payment for said Shares shall be made by the Trust"
"6653","to the Shareholder within seven days after the date on which the"
"6654","request is made.  The obligation set forth in this Section 2 is"
"6655","subject to the provision that in the event that at any time the"
"6656","New York Stock Exchange is closed for other than customary"
"6657","weekends or holidays, or, if permitted by rules of the Securities"
"6658","and Exchange Commission, during periods when trading on the"
"6659","Exchange is restricted or during any emergency which makes it"
"6660","impractical for the Trust to dispose of its investments or to"
"6661","determine fairly the value of its net assets, or during any other"
"6662","period permitted by order of the Securities and Exchange"
"6663","Commission for the protection of investors, such obligation may"
"6664","be suspended or postponed by the Trustees.  The Trust may also"
"6665","purchase or repurchase Shares at a price not exceeding the net"
"6666","asset value of such Shares in effect when the purchase or"
"6667","repurchase or any contract to purchase or repurchase is made."
"6668","Payment for any redemption, purchase or repurchase may be made in"
"6669","cash or, except to the extent prohibited by the laws of any"
"6670","jurisdiction in which Shares are registered for sale, in other"
"6671","property, or any combination thereof.  The composition of any"
"6672","such payment shall be determined by the Trust in its sole"
"6673","discretion, and the Trust shall have no obligation to effect a"
"6674","pro rata division of cash or other property in making any such"
"6675","payment.  In no event shall the Trust be liable for any delay of"
"6676","any other person in transferring securities or other property"
"6677","selected for delivery as all or part of any such payment."
"6678","Redemption at the Option of the Trust"
"6679","      Section 3.	The Trust shall have the right at its option and at"
"6680","any time to redeem Shares of any Shareholder at the net asset"
"6681","value thereof as determined in accordance with the Bylaws: (i) if"
"6682","at such time such Shareholder owns fewer Shares than, or Shares"
"6683","having an aggregate net asset value of less than, an amount"
"6684","determined from time to time by the Trustees, in which case the"
"6685","Trust may redeem all Shares owned by such Shareholder or only so"
"6686","many of such Shares as may be required to compensate the Trust"
"6687","for any fee fixed from time to time by the Trustees for the"
"6688","maintenance of small accounts; (ii) to the extent that such"
"6689","Shareholder owns Shares of a particular series of Shares equal to"
"6690","or in excess of a percentage of the outstanding Shares of that"
"6691","series determined from time to time by the Trustees; (iii) to the"
"6692","extent that such Shareholder owns Shares of the Trust"
"6693","representing a percentage equal to or in excess of such"
"6694","percentage of the aggregate number of outstanding Shares of the"
"6695","Trust or the aggregate net asset value of the Trust determined"
"6696","from time to time by the Trustees; (iv) if such Shareholder fails"
"6697","to supply appropriate personal and tax identification information"
"6698","requested by the Trust; (v) if such Shareholder fails to meet or"
"6699","maintain the qualifications for ownership of a particular series"
"6700","or class; or (vi) if the Trustees determine for any other reason,"
"6701","in their sole discretion, that the ownership of Shares by a"
"6702","Shareholder is not in the best interests of the remaining"
"6703","Shareholders of the Trust or of the applicable series or class."

"6715","misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of"

"6724","(including without limitation identification of a Trustee as an"
"6725","audit committee financial expert) shall not impose on that person"
"6726","any duty, obligation or liability that is greater than the"

"6728","Trustee in the absence of such appointment, designation or"
"6729","identification, and no Trustee who has special skills or"
"6730","expertise or who is appointed, designated of identified as"

"6736","Trustee against any liability to which he or she would otherwise"
"6737","be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross"
"6738","negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the"

"6749","amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as"
"6750","fines and penalties, and counsel fees reasonably incurred by any"
"6751","Covered Person in connection with the defense or disposition of"
"6752","any threatened, pending, or contemplated action, suit, or"
"6753","proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative,"
"6754","or investigative and whether formal or informal before any court"
"6755","or administrative or legislative or other body, in which such"
"6756","Covered Person may be or may have been involved as a party or"
"6757","otherwise or with which such Covered Person may be or may have"
"6758","been threatened, while in office or thereafter, by reason of"
"6759","being or having been such a Covered Person except with respect to"
"6760","any matter as to which such Covered Person shall have been"
"6761","finally adjudicated in any such action, suit or other proceeding"
"6762","(a) not to have acted in good faith, (b) not to have acted in the"
"6763","reasonable belief that such Covered Persons action was in the"
"6764","best interests of the Trust or at least was not opposed to the"
"6765","best interests of the Trust, (c) in the case of a criminal"
"6766","proceeding, to have had reasonable cause to believe his or her"
"6767","action was unlawful or (d) to be liable to the Trust or its"
"6768","Shareholders by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross"
"6769","negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the"
"6770","conduct of such Covered Persons office (each of such exceptions"
"6771","being referred to hereinafter as Disabling Conduct).  Expenses,"
"6772","including counsel fees so incurred by any such Covered Person"
"6773","(but excluding amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in"
"6774","compromise or as fines or penalties), shall be paid from time to"
"6775","time by the Trust in advance of the final disposition of any such"
"6776","action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or"
"6777","on behalf of such Covered Person to repay amounts so paid to the"
"6778","Trust if it is ultimately determined that indemnification of such"
"6779","expenses is not authorized under this Article, provided, however,"
"6780","that either (a) such Covered Person shall have provided"
"6781","appropriate security for such undertaking, (b) the Trust shall be"
"6782","insured against losses arising from any such advance payments or"
"6783","(c) either a majority of the disinterested Trustees acting on the"
"6784","matter (provided that a majority of the disinterested Trustees"
"6785","then in office act on the matter), or independent legal counsel"
"6786","in a written opinion, shall have determined, based upon a review"
"6787","of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial type"
"6788","inquiry) that there is reason to believe that such Covered Person"
"6789","will be found entitled to indemnification under this Article. In"
"6790","making any such determination, the disinterested Trustees or such"
"6791","counsel, as the case may be, shall afford the Covered Person a"
"6792","rebuttable presumption that the Covered Person did not engage in"
"6793","Disabling Conduct."
"6794","Compromise Payment"
"6795","      Section 2.	As to any matter disposed of (whether by a"
"6796","compromise payment, pursuant to a consent decree or otherwise)"
"6797","without an adjudication by a court, or by any other body before"
"6798","which the action, suit, or proceeding was brought, that such"
"6799","Covered Person engaged in Disabling Conduct, indemnification"
"6800","shall be provided if (a) approved as in the best interests of the"
"6801","Trust, after notice that it involves such indemnification, by at"
"6802","least a majority of the disinterested Trustees acting on the"
"6803","matter (provided that a majority of the disinterested Trustees"
"6804","then in office act on the matter) upon a determination, based"
"6805","upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full"
"6806","trial type inquiry) that such Covered Person did not engage in"
"6807","Disabling Conduct, or (b) there has been obtained an opinion in"
"6808","writing of independent legal counsel, based upon a review of"
"6809","readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial type inquiry)"
"6810","to the effect that such Covered Person did not engage in"
"6811","Disabling Conduct.  Any approval pursuant to this Section shall"
"6812","not prevent the recovery from any Covered Person of any amount"
"6813","paid to such Covered Person in accordance with this Section as"
"6814","indemnification if such Covered Person is subsequently"
"6815","adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction not to have"
"6816","engaged in Disabling Conduct."
"6817","Right Not Exclusive"
"6818","      Section 3.	The right of indemnification hereby provided shall"
"6819","not be exclusive of or affect any other rights to which such"
"6820","Covered Person may be entitled.  As used in this Article VIII,"
"6821","the term Covered Person shall include such persons heirs,"
"6822","executors and administrators and a disinterested Trustee is a"
"6823","Trustee who is not an interested person of the Trust as defined"
"6824","in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (or who has been exempted"
"6825","from being an interested person by any rule, regulation or order"

"6827","of such actions, suits or other proceedings or another action,"
"6828","suit or other proceeding on the same or similar grounds is then"
"6829","or has been pending.  Nothing contained in this Article shall"
"6830","affect any rights to indemnification to which personnel of the"
"6831","Trust, other than Trustees or officers, and other persons may be"
"6832","entitled by contract or otherwise under law, nor the power of the"
"6833","Trust to purchase and maintain liability insurance on behalf of"
"6834","any such person."
"6835","Shareholders"
"6836","      Section 4.	In case any Shareholder or former Shareholder shall"
"6837","be held to be personally liable solely by reason of his or her"
"6838","being or having been a Shareholder and not because of his or her"
"6839","acts or omissions or for some other reason, the Shareholder or"
"6840","former Shareholder (or his or her heirs, executors,"

"6842","corporation or other entity, its corporate or other general"
"6843","successor) shall be entitled to be held harmless from and"
"6844","indemnified against all loss and expense arising from such"

"7109","SUB MANAGEMENT CONTRACT"
"7110","      This Sub Management Contract is dated as of February 27,"
"7111","2014 between PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC, a Delaware"
"7112","limited liability company (the Manager) and PUTNAM INVESTMENTS"
"7113","LIMITED, a company organized under the laws of England and Wales"
"7114","(the Sub Manager)."
"7115","      WHEREAS, the Manager is the investment manager of each of"
"7116","the investment companies registered under the United States"
"7117","Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, that are identified"
"7118","on Schedule A hereto, as it may from time to time be amended by"
"7119","the Manager (the Funds), and a registered investment adviser"
"7120","under the United States Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as"
"7121","amended;"
"7122","      WHEREAS, the Sub Manager is licensed as an investment"
"7123","manager by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom"
"7124","(the FCA); and"
"7125","      WHEREAS, the Manager desires to engage the Sub Manager from"
"7126","time to time to manage a portion of certain of the Funds:"
"7127","      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants"
"7128","herein contained, it is agreed as follows:"
"7129","1.	SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY SUB MANAGER."
"7130","      (a)	The Sub Manager, at its expense, will furnish"
"7131","continuously an investment program for that portion of any Fund"
"7132","the management of which is allocated from time to time by the"
"7133","Manager to the Sub Manager (an Allocated Sleeve). The Manager"
"7134","shall, in its sole discretion, determine which Funds will have an"
"7135","Allocated Sleeve and the amount of assets allocated from time to"
"7136","time to each such Allocated Sleeve; provided that, with respect"
"7137","to any Fund, the Trustees of such Fund must have approved the use"
"7138","of the Sub Manager prior to the creation of an Allocated Sleeve"
"7139","for such Fund. The Sub Manager will determine what investments"
"7140","shall be purchased, held, sold or exchanged by any Allocated"
"7141","Sleeve and what portion, if any, of the assets of the Allocated"
"7142","Sleeve shall be held uninvested and shall, on behalf of the Fund,"
"7143","make changes in the Funds investments held in such Allocated"
"7144","Sleeve."
"7145","      (b)	The Manager may also, at its discretion, request the"
"7146","Sub Manager to provide assistance with purchasing and selling"
"7147","securities for any Fund, including the placement of orders with"
"7148","broker dealers selected in accordance with Section 1(d), even if"
"7149","the Manager has not established an Allocated Sleeve for such"
"7150","Fund."
"7151","      (c)	The Sub Manager at its expense will furnish all"
"7152","necessary investment and management facilities, including"
"7153","salaries of personnel, required for it to execute its duties"
"7154","faithfully."
"7155","      (d)	The Sub Manager shall place all orders for the purchase"
"7156","and sale of portfolio investments for any Allocated Sleeve with"
"7157","brokers or dealers selected by the Sub Manager. In the selection"
"7158","of such brokers or dealers and the placing of such orders, the"
"7159","Sub Manager shall use its best efforts to obtain for the related"
"7160","Fund the most favorable price and execution available, except to"
"7161","the extent it may be permitted to pay higher brokerage"
"7162","commissions for brokerage and research services as described"
"7163","below. In using its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the most"
"7164","favorable price and execution available, the Sub Manager, bearing"
"7165","in mind the Funds best interests at all times, shall consider all"
"7166","factors it deems relevant, including by way of illustration,"
"7167","price, the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for"
"7168","the security, the amount of the commission, the timing of the"
"7169","transaction taking into account market prices and trends, the"
"7170","reputation, experience and financial stability of the broker or"
"7171","dealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the broker"
"7172","or dealer in other transactions. Subject to such policies as the"
"7173","Trustees of the Funds may determine, the Sub Manager shall not be"
"7174","deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty"
"7175","created by this Contract or otherwise solely by reason of its"
"7176","having caused a Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides"
"7177","brokerage and research services to the Manager or the Sub Manager"
"7178","an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment"
"7179","transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker"
"7180","or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if"
"7181","the Sub Manager determines in good faith that such amount of"
"7182","commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the"
"7183","brokerage and research services provided by such broker or"
"7184","dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or"
"7185","its overall responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to"
"7186","other clients of the Manager or the Sub Manager as to which the"
"7187","Manager or the Sub Manager exercises investment discretion. The"
"7188","Sub Manager agrees that in connection with purchases or sales of"
"7189","portfolio investments for any Fund, neither the Sub Manager nor"
"7190","any officer, director, employee or agent of the Sub Manager shall"
"7191","act as a principal or receive any commission other than as"
"7192","provided in Section 3."
"7193","      (e)	The Sub Manager shall not be obligated to pay any"
"7194","expenses of or for the Manager or any Fund not expressly assumed"
"7195","by the Sub Manager pursuant to this Section 1."
"7196","      (f)	In the performance of its duties, the Sub Manager will"
"7197","comply with the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of"
"7198","Trust and By Laws of each applicable Fund and such Funds stated"
"7199","investment objectives, policies and restrictions, and will use"
"7200","its best efforts to safeguard and promote the welfare of such"
"7201","Fund and to comply with other policies which the Manager or the"
"7202","Trustees may from time to time determine and shall exercise the"
"7203","same care and diligence expected of the Manager."
"7204","2.	OTHER AGREEMENTS, ETC."
"7205","      It is understood that any of the shareholders, Trustees,"
"7206","officers and employees of a Fund may be a shareholder, director,"
"7207","officer or employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the Sub"
"7208","Manager, and in any person controlled by or under common control"
"7209","with the Sub Manager, and that the Sub Manager and any person"
"7210","controlled by or under common control with the Sub Manager may"
"7211","have an interest in such Fund. It is also understood that the Sub"
"7212","Manager and any person controlled by or under common control with"
"7213","the Sub Manager have and may have advisory, management, service"
"7214","or other contracts with other organizations and persons, and may"
"7215","have other interests and business."
"7216","3.	COMPENSATION."
"7217","      Except as provided below, the Manager will pay to the Sub"
"7218","Manager as compensation for the Sub Managers services rendered, a"
"7219","fee, computed and paid quarterly at the annual rate of 0.35% per"
"7220","annum of average aggregate net asset value of the assets in"
"7221","equity and asset allocation Allocated Sleeves and 0.40% per annum"
"7222","of average aggregate net asset value of the assets in fixed"
"7223","income Allocated Sleeves, except for fixed income Allocated"
"7224","Sleeves in certain fixed income Funds enumerated as follows (with"
"7225","the per annum fee provided in parentheses): Putnam Money Market"
"7226","Liquidity Fund (0.20%), Putnam Short Term Investment Fund"
"7227","(0.20%), Putnam Money Market Fund (0.25%), Putnam Tax Exempt"
"7228","Money Market Fund (0.25%), Putnam VT Money Market Fund (0.25%),"
"7229","Putnam Short Duration Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam Short Term"
"7230","Municipal Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam American Government Income"
"7231","Fund (0.25%), Putnam Income Fund (0.25%), Putnam U.S. Government"
"7232","Income Trust (0.25%), Putnam VT American Government Income Fund"
"7233","(0.25%), and Putnam VT Income Fund (0.25%)."
"7234","      Such average net asset value shall be determined by taking"
"7235","an average of all of the determinations of such net asset value"
"7236","during a quarter at the close of business on each business day"
"7237","during such quarter while this Contract is in effect. Such fee"
"7238","shall be payable for each quarter within 30 days after the close"
"7239","of such quarter. The Sub Manager shall look only to the Manager"
"7240","for payment of its fees. No Fund shall have any responsibility"
"7241","for paying any fees due the Sub Manager."
"7242","      With respect to each of Putnam High Income Securities Fund,"
"7243","Putnam Master Intermediate Income Trust and Putnam Premier Income"
"7244","Trust, the Manager will pay to the Sub Manager as compensation"
"7245","for the Sub Managers services rendered, a fee, computed and paid"
"7246","quarterly at the annual rate of 0.40% of Average Weekly Assets in"
"7247","Allocated Sleeves. Average Weekly Assets means the average of the"
"7248","weekly determinations of the difference between the total assets"
"7249","of the Fund (including any assets attributable to leverage for"
"7250","investment purposes) attributable to an Allocated Sleeve and the"
"7251","total liabilities of the Fund (excluding liabilities incurred in"
"7252","connection with leverage for investment purposes) attributable to"
"7253","such Allocated Sleeve, determined at the close of the last"
"7254","business day of each week, for each week which ends during the"
"7255","quarter. Such fee shall be payable for each quarter within 30"
"7256","days after the close of such quarter. As used in this Section 3,"
"7257","leverage for investment purposes means any incurrence of"
"7258","indebtedness the proceeds of which are to be invested in"
"7259","accordance with the Funds investment objective. For purposes of"
"7260","calculating Average Weekly Assets, liabilities associated with"
"7261","any instruments or transactions used to leverage the Funds"
"7262","portfolio for investment purposes (whether or not such"
"7263","instruments or transactions are covered within the meaning of the"
"7264","Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and regulations"
"7265","thereunder, giving effect to any interpretations of the"
"7266","Securities and Exchange Commission and its staff) are not"
"7267","considered liabilities. For purposes of calculating Average"
"7268","Weekly Assets, the total assets of the Fund will be deemed to"
"7269","include (a) any proceeds from the sale or transfer of an asset"
"7270","(the Underlying Asset) of the Fund to a counterparty in a reverse"
"7271","repurchase or dollar roll transaction and (b) the value of such"
"7272","Underlying Asset as of the relevant measuring date."
"7273","      In the event that the Managers management fee from any of"
"7274","Putnam High Income Securities Fund, Putnam Master Intermediate"
"7275","Income Trust or Putnam Premier Income Trust is reduced pursuant"
"7276","to the investment management contract between such Fund and the"
"7277","Manager because during any Measurement Period (as defined below)"
"7278","the amount of interest payments and fees with respect to"
"7279","indebtedness or other obligation of the Fund incurred for"
"7280","investment leverage purposes, plus additional expenses"
"7281","attributable to any such leverage for investment purposes,"
"7282","exceeds the portion of the Funds net income and net short term"
"7283","capital gains (but not long term capital gains) accruing during"
"7284","such Measurement Period as a result of the fact that such"
"7285","indebtedness or other obligation was outstanding during the"
"7286","Measurement Period, the fee payable to  the Sub Manager with"
"7287","respect to such Fund shall be reduced in the same proportion as"
"7288","the fee paid to the Manager with respect to such Fund is so"
"7289","reduced. Measurement Period shall be any period for which"
"7290","payments of interest or fees (whether designated as such or"
"7291","implied) are payable in connection with any indebtedness or other"
"7292","obligation of the Fund incurred for investment purposes."
"7293","      If the Sub Manager shall serve for less than the whole of a"
"7294","quarter, the foregoing compensation shall be prorated."
"7295","4.	ASSIGNMENT TERMINATES THIS CONTRACT; AMENDMENTS OF THIS"
"7296","CONTRACT."
"7297","      This Contract shall automatically terminate without the"
"7298","payment of any penalty, in the event of its assignment; and this"
"7299","Contract shall not be amended with respect to any Allocated"
"7300","Sleeve unless such amendment be approved at a meeting by the"
"7301","vote, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of"
"7302","voting on such approval, of a majority of the Trustees of the"
"7303","related Fund who are not interested persons of such Fund or of"
"7304","the Manager."
"7305","5.	EFFECTIVE PERIOD AND TERMINATION OF THIS CONTRACT."
"7306","      This Contract shall become effective upon its execution, and"

"7320","cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on"
"7321","such approval, do not specifically approve at least annually the"
"7322","continuance of this Contract, then this Contract shall"

"7324","anniversary of its execution, or upon the expiration of one year"
"7325","from the effective date of the last such continuance, whichever"

"7330","      Action by a Fund under (a) above may be taken either (i) by"

"7585","PUTNAM ASSET ALLOCATION FUNDS"
"7586","MANAGEMENT CONTRACT"
"7587","      This Management Contract is dated as of February 27, 2014"
"7588","between PUTNAM ASSET ALLOCATION FUNDS, a Massachusetts business"
"7589","trust (the Fund), and PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC, a"
"7590","Delaware limited liability company (the Manager)."
"7591","      In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained,"
"7592","it is agreed as follows:"
"7593","1.	SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY MANAGER TO FUND."
"7594","      (a)	The Manager, at its expense, will furnish continuously"
"7595","an investment program for the Fund or, in the case of a Fund that"
"7596","has divided its shares into two or more series under Section"
"7597","18(f)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the"
"7598","1940 Act), each series of the Fund identified from time to time"
"7599","on Schedule A to this Contract (each reference in this Contract"
"7600","to a Fund or to the Fund is also deemed to be a reference to any"
"7601","existing series of the Fund, as appropriate in the particular"
"7602","context), will determine what investments will be purchased, held,"
"7603","sold or exchanged by the Fund and what portion, if any, of the"
"7604","assets of the Fund will be held uninvested and will, on behalf of"
"7605","the Fund, make changes in such investments. Subject always to the"
"7606","control of the Trustees of the Fund and except for the functions"
"7607","carried out by the officers and personnel referred to in Section"
"7608","1(d), the Manager will also manage, supervise and conduct the"
"7609","other affairs and business of the Fund and matters incidental"
"7610","thereto. In the performance of its duties, the Manager will"
"7611","comply with the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of"
"7612","Trust and By Laws of the Fund and the stated investment"
"7613","objectives, policies and restrictions of the Fund, will use its"
"7614","best efforts to safeguard and promote the welfare of the Fund and"
"7615","to comply with other policies which the Trustees may from time to"
"7616","time determine and will exercise the same care and diligence"
"7617","expected of the Trustees."
"7618","      (b)	The Manager, at its expense, except as such expense is"
"7619","paid by the Fund as provided in Section 1(d), will furnish (1)"
"7620","all necessary investment and management facilities, including"
"7621","salaries of personnel, required for it to execute its duties"
"7622","faithfully; (2) suitable office space for the Fund; and (3)"
"7623","administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical"
"7624","personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of"
"7625","the affairs of the Fund, including determination of the net asset"
"7626","value of the Fund, but excluding shareholder accounting services."
"7627","Except as otherwise provided in Section 1(d), the Manager will"
"7628","pay the compensation, if any, of the officers of the Fund."
"7629","      (c)	The Manager, at its expense, will place all orders for"
"7630","the purchase and sale of portfolio investments for the Funds"
"7631","account with brokers or dealers selected by the Manager. In the"
"7632","selection of such brokers or dealers and the placing of such"
"7633","orders, the Manager will use its best efforts to obtain for the"
"7634","Fund the most favorable price and execution available, except to"
"7635","the extent it may be permitted to pay higher brokerage"
"7636","commissions for brokerage and research services as described"
"7637","below. In using its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the most"
"7638","favorable price and execution available, the Manager, bearing in"
"7639","mind the Funds best interests at all times, will consider all"
"7640","factors it deems relevant, including by way of illustration,"
"7641","price, the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for"
"7642","the security, the amount of the commission, the timing of the"
"7643","transaction taking into account market prices and trends, the"
"7644","reputation, experience and financial stability of the broker or"
"7645","dealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the broker"
"7646","or dealer in other transactions. Subject to such policies as the"
"7647","Trustees of the Fund may determine, the Manager will not be"
"7648","deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty"
"7649","created by this Contract or otherwise solely by reason of its"
"7650","having caused the Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides"
"7651","brokerage and research services to the Manager an amount of"
"7652","commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in"
"7653","excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would"
"7654","have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Manager"
"7655","determines in good faith that such amount of commission was"
"7656","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research"
"7657","services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in terms of"
"7658","either that particular transaction or the Managers overall"
"7659","responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to other clients of"
"7660","the Manager as to which the Manager exercises investment"
"7661","discretion. The Manager agrees that in connection with purchases"
"7662","or sales of portfolio investments for the Funds account, neither"
"7663","the Manager nor any officer, director, employee or agent of the"
"7664","Manager shall act as a principal or receive any commission other"
"7665","than as provided in Section 3."
"7666","      (d)	The Fund will pay or reimburse the Manager for the"
"7667","compensation in whole or in part of such officers of the Fund and"
"7668","persons assisting them as may be determined from time to time by"
"7669","the Trustees of the Fund. The Fund will also pay or reimburse the"
"7670","Manager for all or part of the cost of suitable office space,"
"7671","utilities, support services and equipment attributable to such"
"7672","officers and persons as may be determined in each case by the"
"7673","Trustees of the Fund. The Fund will pay the fees, if any, of the"
"7674","Trustees of the Fund."
"7675","      (e)	The Manager will not be obligated to pay any expenses"
"7676","of or for the Fund not expressly assumed by the Manager pursuant"
"7677","to this Section 1 other than as provided in Section 3."
"7678","      (f)	Subject to the prior approval of a majority of the"
"7679","Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who are not"
"7680","interested persons and, to the extent required by the 1940 Act"
"7681","and the rules and regulations under the 1940 Act, subject to any"
"7682","applicable guidance or interpretation of the Securities and"
"7683","Exchange Commission or its staff, by the shareholders of the Fund,"
"7684","the Manager may, from time to time, delegate to a sub adviser or"
"7685","sub administrator any of the Managers duties under this Contract,"
"7686","including the management of all or a portion of the assets being"
"7687","managed. In all instances, however, the Manager must oversee the"
"7688","provision of delegated services, the Manager must bear the"
"7689","separate costs of employing any sub adviser or sub administrator,"
"7690","and no delegation will relieve the Manager of any of its"
"7691","obligations under this Contract."
"7692","2.	OTHER AGREEMENTS, ETC."
"7693","      It is understood that any of the shareholders, Trustees,"
"7694","officers and employees of the Fund may be a shareholder, director,"
"7695","officer or employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the"
"7696","Manager, and in any person controlled by or under common control"
"7697","with the Manager, and that the Manager and any person controlled"
"7698","by or under common control with the Manager may have an interest"
"7699","in the Fund. It is also understood that the Manager and any"
"7700","person controlled by or under common control with the Manager may"
"7701","have advisory, management, service or other contracts with other"
"7702","organizations and persons and may have other interests and"
"7703","business."
"7704","3.	COMPENSATION TO BE PAID BY THE FUND TO THE MANAGER."
"7705","      The Fund will pay to the Manager as compensation for the"
"7706","Managers services rendered, for the facilities furnished and for"
"7707","the expenses borne by the Manager pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b),"
"7708","and (c) of Section 1, a fee, based on the Funds Average Net"
"7709","Assets, computed and paid monthly at the annual rates set forth"
"7710","on Schedule B attached to this Contract, as from time to time"
"7711","amended. The Funds Average Net Assets means the average of all of"
"7712","the determinations of the Funds net asset value at the close of"
"7713","business on each business day during each month while this"
"7714","Contract is in effect. The fee is payable for each month within"
"7715","15 days after the close of the month."
"7716","      The fees payable by the Fund to the Manager pursuant to this"
"7717","Section 3 will be reduced by any commissions, fees, brokerage or"
"7718","similar payments received by the Manager or any affiliated person"
"7719","of the Manager in connection with the purchase and sale of"
"7720","portfolio investments of the Fund, less any direct expenses"
"7721","approved by the Trustees incurred by the Manager or any"
"7722","affiliated person of the Manager in connection with obtaining"
"7723","such payments."
"7724","      In the event that expenses of the Fund for any fiscal year"
"7725","exceed the expense limitation on investment company expenses"
"7726","imposed by any statute or regulatory authority of any"
"7727","jurisdiction in which shares of the Fund are qualified for offer"
"7728","or sale, the compensation due the Manager for such fiscal year"
"7729","will be reduced by the amount of excess by a reduction or refund"
"7730","thereof. In the event that the expenses of the Fund exceed any"
"7731","expense limitation which the Manager may, by written notice to"
"7732","the Fund, voluntarily declare to be effective subject to such"
"7733","terms and conditions as the Manager may prescribe in such notice,"
"7734","the compensation due the Manager will be reduced, and if"
"7735","necessary, the Manager will assume expenses of the Fund, to the"
"7736","extent required by the terms and conditions of such expense"
"7737","limitation."
"7738","      If the Manager serves for less than the whole of a month,"
"7739","the foregoing compensation will be prorated."
"7740","4.	ASSIGNMENT TERMINATES THIS CONTRACT; AMENDMENTS OF THIS"
"7741","CONTRACT."
"7742","      This Contract will automatically terminate, without the"
"7743","payment of any penalty, in the event of its assignment, provided"
"7744","that no delegation of responsibilities by the Manager pursuant to"
"7745","Section 1(f) will be deemed to constitute an assignment. No"
"7746","provision of this Contract may be changed, waived, discharged or"
"7747","terminated orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by"
"7748","the party against which enforcement of the change, waiver,"
"7749","discharge or termination is sought. No amendment of this Contract"
"7750","is effective until approved in a manner consistent with the 1940"
"7751","Act, the rules and regulations under the 1940 Act and any"
"7752","applicable guidance or interpretation of the Securities and"
"7753","Exchange Commission or its staff."
"7754","5.	EFFECTIVE PERIOD AND TERMINATION OF THIS CONTRACT."
"7755","      This Contract is effective upon its execution and will"
"7756","remain in full force and effect as to a Fund continuously"
"7757","thereafter (unless terminated automatically as set forth in"
"7758","Section 4 or terminated in accordance with the following"
"7759","paragraph) through June 30, 2014, and will continue in effect"
"7760","from year to year thereafter so long as its continuance is"
"7761","approved at least annually by (i) the Trustees, or the"
"7762","shareholders by the affirmative vote of a majority of the"
"7763","outstanding shares of the respective Fund, and (ii) a majority of"
"7764","the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Fund or of the"
"7765","Manager, by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the"
"7766","purpose of voting on such approval."
"7767","      Either party hereto may at any time terminate this Contract"
"7768","as to a Fund by not less than 60 days written notice delivered or"
"7769","mailed by registered mail, postage prepaid, to the other party."

"7913","MANAGEMENT CONTRACT"
"7914","       This Management Contract is dated as of February 27, 2014 between"
"7915","PUTNAM ASSET ALLOCATION FUNDS, a Massachusetts business trust (the"
"7916","Fund), and PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC, a Delaware limited"
"7917","liability company (the Manager)."
"7918","       In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, it is"
"7919","agreed as follows:"
"7920","1.	SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY MANAGER TO FUND."
"7921","       (a)	The Manager, at its expense, will furnish continuously an"
"7922","investment program for the Fund or, in the case of a Fund that has"
"7923","divided its shares into two or more series under Section 18(f)(2) of"
"7924","the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), each"
"7925","series of the Fund identified from time to time on Schedule A to this"
"7926","Contract (each reference in this Contract to a Fund or to the Fund is"
"7927","also deemed to be a reference to any existing series of the Fund, as"
"7928","appropriate in the particular context), will determine what"
"7929","investments will be purchased, held, sold or exchanged by the Fund and"
"7930","what portion, if any, of the assets of the Fund will be held"
"7931","uninvested and will, on behalf of the Fund, make changes in such"
"7932","investments. Subject always to the control of the Trustees of the Fund"
"7933","and except for the functions carried out by the officers and personnel"
"7934","referred to in Section 1(d), the Manager will also manage, supervise"
"7935","and conduct the other affairs and business of the Fund and matters"
"7936","incidental thereto. In the performance of its duties, the Manager will"
"7937","comply with the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust"
"7938","and By Laws of the Fund and the stated investment objectives, policies"
"7939","and restrictions of the Fund, will use its best efforts to safeguard"
"7940","and promote the welfare of the Fund and to comply with other policies"
"7941","which the Trustees may from time to time determine and will exercise"
"7942","the same care and diligence expected of the Trustees."
"7943","       (b)	The Manager, at its expense, except as such expense is paid"
"7944","by the Fund as provided in Section 1(d), will furnish (1) all"
"7945","necessary investment and management facilities, including salaries of"
"7946","personnel, required for it to execute its duties faithfully; (2)"
"7947","suitable office space for the Fund; and (3) administrative facilities,"
"7948","including bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment necessary for"
"7949","the efficient conduct of the affairs of the Fund, including"
"7950","determination of the net asset value of the Fund, but excluding"
"7951","shareholder accounting services. Except as otherwise provided in"
"7952","Section 1(d), the Manager will pay the compensation, if any, of the"
"7953","officers of the Fund."
"7954","       (c)	The Manager, at its expense, will place all orders for the"
"7955","purchase and sale of portfolio investments for the Funds account with"
"7956","brokers or dealers selected by the Manager. In the selection of such"
"7957","brokers or dealers and the placing of such orders, the Manager will"
"7958","use its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the most favorable price"
"7959","and execution available, except to the extent it may be permitted to"
"7960","pay higher brokerage commissions for brokerage and research services"
"7961","as described below. In using its best efforts to obtain for the Fund"
"7962","the most favorable price and execution available, the Manager, bearing"
"7963","in mind the Funds best interests at all times, will consider all"
"7964","factors it deems relevant, including by way of illustration, price,"
"7965","the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for the security,"
"7966","the amount of the commission, the timing of the transaction taking"
"7967","into account market prices and trends, the reputation, experience and"
"7968","financial stability of the broker or dealer involved and the quality"
"7969","of service rendered by the broker or dealer in other transactions."
"7970","Subject to such policies as the Trustees of the Fund may determine,"
"7971","the Manager will not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have"
"7972","breached any duty created by this Contract or otherwise solely by"
"7973","reason of its having caused the Fund to pay a broker or dealer that"
"7974","provides brokerage and research services to the Manager an amount of"
"7975","commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in excess"
"7976","of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have"
"7977","charged for effecting that transaction, if the Manager determines in"
"7978","good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation"
"7979","to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such"
"7980","broker or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular"
"7981","transaction or the Managers overall responsibilities with respect to"
"7982","the Fund and to other clients of the Manager as to which the Manager"
"7983","exercises investment discretion. The Manager agrees that in connection"
"7984","with purchases or sales of portfolio investments for the Funds account,"
"7985","neither the Manager nor any officer, director, employee or agent of"
"7986","the Manager shall act as a principal or receive any commission other"
"7987","than as provided in Section 3."
"7988","       (d)	The Fund will pay or reimburse the Manager for the"
"7989","compensation in whole or in part of such officers of the Fund and"
"7990","persons assisting them as may be determined from time to time by the"
"7991","Trustees of the Fund. The Fund will also pay or reimburse the Manager"
"7992","for all or part of the cost of suitable office space, utilities,"
"7993","support services and equipment attributable to such officers and"
"7994","persons as may be determined in each case by the Trustees of the Fund."
"7995","The Fund will pay the fees, if any, of the Trustees of the Fund."
"7996","       (e)	The Manager will not be obligated to pay any expenses of or"
"7997","for the Fund not expressly assumed by the Manager pursuant to this"
"7998","Section 1 other than as provided in Section 3."
"7999","       (f)	Subject to the prior approval of a majority of the Trustees,"
"8000","including a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons"
"8001","and, to the extent required by the 1940 Act and the rules and"
"8002","regulations under the 1940 Act, subject to any applicable guidance or"
"8003","interpretation of the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff,"
"8004","by the shareholders of the Fund, the Manager may, from time to time,"
"8005","delegate to a sub adviser or sub administrator any of the Managers"
"8006","duties under this Contract, including the management of all or a"
"8007","portion of the assets being managed. In all instances, however, the"
"8008","Manager must oversee the provision of delegated services, the Manager"
"8009","must bear the separate costs of employing any sub adviser or sub"
"8010","administrator, and no delegation will relieve the Manager of any of"
"8011","its obligations under this Contract."
"8012","2.	OTHER AGREEMENTS, ETC."
"8013","       It is understood that any of the shareholders, Trustees, officers"
"8014","and employees of the Fund may be a shareholder, director, officer or"
"8015","employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the Manager, and in any"
"8016","person controlled by or under common control with the Manager, and"
"8017","that the Manager and any person controlled by or under common control"
"8018","with the Manager may have an interest in the Fund. It is also"
"8019","understood that the Manager and any person controlled by or under"
"8020","common control with the Manager may have advisory, management, service"
"8021","or other contracts with other organizations and persons and may have"
"8022","other interests and business."
"8023","3.	COMPENSATION TO BE PAID BY THE FUND TO THE MANAGER."
"8024","       The Fund will pay to the Manager as compensation for the Managers"
"8025","services rendered, for the facilities furnished and for the expenses"
"8026","borne by the Manager pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of"
"8027","Section 1, a fee, based on the Funds Average Net Assets, computed and"
"8028","paid monthly at the annual rates set forth on Schedule B attached to"
"8029","this Contract, as from time to time amended. The Funds Average Net"
"8030","Assets means the average of all of the determinations of the Funds net"
"8031","asset value at the close of business on each business day during each"
"8032","month while this Contract is in effect. The fee is payable for each"
"8033","month within 15 days after the close of the month."
"8034","       The fees payable by the Fund to the Manager pursuant to this"
"8035","Section 3 will be reduced by any commissions, fees, brokerage or"
"8036","similar payments received by the Manager or any affiliated person of"
"8037","the Manager in connection with the purchase and sale of portfolio"
"8038","investments of the Fund, less any direct expenses approved by the"
"8039","Trustees incurred by the Manager or any affiliated person of the"
"8040","Manager in connection with obtaining such payments."
"8041","       In the event that expenses of the Fund for any fiscal year exceed"
"8042","the expense limitation on investment company expenses imposed by any"
"8043","statute or regulatory authority of any jurisdiction in which shares of"
"8044","the Fund are qualified for offer or sale, the compensation due the"
"8045","Manager for such fiscal year will be reduced by the amount of excess"
"8046","by a reduction or refund thereof. In the event that the expenses of"
"8047","the Fund exceed any expense limitation which the Manager may, by"
"8048","written notice to the Fund, voluntarily declare to be effective"
"8049","subject to such terms and conditions as the Manager may prescribe in"
"8050","such notice, the compensation due the Manager will be reduced, and if"
"8051","necessary, the Manager will assume expenses of the Fund, to the extent"
"8052","required by the terms and conditions of such expense limitation."
"8053","       If the Manager serves for less than the whole of a month, the"
"8054","foregoing compensation will be prorated."
"8055","4.	ASSIGNMENT TERMINATES THIS CONTRACT; AMENDMENTS OF THIS CONTRACT."
"8056","       This Contract will automatically terminate, without the payment"
"8057","of any penalty, in the event of its assignment, provided that no"
"8058","delegation of responsibilities by the Manager pursuant to Section 1(f)"
"8059","will be deemed to constitute an assignment. No provision of this"
"8060","Contract may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but"
"8061","only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which"
"8062","enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought."
"8063","No amendment of this Contract is effective until approved in a manner"
"8064","consistent with the 1940 Act, the rules and regulations under the 1940"
"8065","Act and any applicable guidance or interpretation of the Securities"
"8066","and Exchange Commission or its staff."
"8067","5.	EFFECTIVE PERIOD AND TERMINATION OF THIS CONTRACT."
"8068","       This Contract is effective upon its execution and will remain in"
"8069","full force and effect as to a Fund continuously thereafter (unless"
"8070","terminated automatically as set forth in Section 4 or terminated in"
"8071","accordance with the following paragraph) through June 30, 2014, and"
"8072","will continue in effect from year to year thereafter so long as its"
"8073","continuance is approved at least annually by (i) the Trustees, or the"

"8083","Trustees or (ii) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the"
"8084","outstanding shares of the respective Fund."
"8085","       Termination of this Contract pursuant to this Section 5 will be"
"8086","without the payment of any penalty."

"8220","PUTNAM ASSET ALLOCATION FUNDS"
"8221","MANAGEMENT CONTRACT"
"8222","      This Management Contract is dated as of February 27, 2014"
"8223","between PUTNAM ASSET ALLOCATION FUNDS, a Massachusetts business"
"8224","trust (the Fund), and PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC, a"
"8225","Delaware limited liability company (the Manager)."
"8226","      In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained,"
"8227","it is agreed as follows:"
"8228","1.	SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY MANAGER TO FUND."
"8229","      (a)	The Manager, at its expense, will furnish continuously"
"8230","an investment program for the Fund or, in the case of a Fund that"
"8231","has divided its shares into two or more series under Section"
"8232","18(f)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the"
"8233","1940 Act), each series of the Fund identified from time to time"
"8234","on Schedule A to this Contract (each reference in this Contract"
"8235","to a Fund or to the Fund is also deemed to be a reference to any"
"8236","existing series of the Fund, as appropriate in the particular"
"8237","context), will determine what investments will be purchased, held,"
"8238","sold or exchanged by the Fund and what portion, if any, of the"
"8239","assets of the Fund will be held uninvested and will, on behalf of"
"8240","the Fund, make changes in such investments. Subject always to the"
"8241","control of the Trustees of the Fund and except for the functions"
"8242","carried out by the officers and personnel referred to in Section"
"8243","1(d), the Manager will also manage, supervise and conduct the"
"8244","other affairs and business of the Fund and matters incidental"
"8245","thereto. In the performance of its duties, the Manager will"
"8246","comply with the provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of"
"8247","Trust and ByLaws of the Fund and the stated investment objectives,"
"8248","policies and restrictions of the Fund, will use its best efforts"
"8249","to safeguard and promote the welfare of the Fund and to comply"
"8250","with other policies which the Trustees may from time to time"
"8251","determine and will exercise the same care and diligence expected"
"8252","of the Trustees."
"8253","      (b)	The Manager, at its expense, except as such expense is"
"8254","paid by the Fund as provided in Section 1(d), will furnish (1)"
"8255","all necessary investment and management facilities, including"
"8256","salaries of personnel, required for it to execute its duties"
"8257","faithfully; (2) suitable office space for the Fund; and (3)"
"8258","administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical"
"8259","personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of"
"8260","the affairs of the Fund, including determination of the net asset"
"8261","value of the Fund, but excluding shareholder accounting services."
"8262","Except as otherwise provided in Section 1(d), the Manager will"
"8263","pay the compensation, if any, of the officers of the Fund."
"8264","      (c)	The Manager, at its expense, will place all orders for"
"8265","the purchase and sale of portfolio investments for the Funds"
"8266","account with brokers or dealers selected by the Manager. In the"
"8267","selection of such brokers or dealers and the placing of such"
"8268","orders, the Manager will use its best efforts to obtain for the"
"8269","Fund the most favorable price and execution available, except to"
"8270","the extent it may be permitted to pay higher brokerage"
"8271","commissions for brokerage and research services as described"
"8272","below. In using its best efforts to obtain for the Fund the most"
"8273","favorable price and execution available, the Manager, bearing in"
"8274","mind the Funds best interests at all times, will consider all"
"8275","factors it deems relevant, including by way of illustration,"
"8276","price, the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for"
"8277","the security, the amount of the commission, the timing of the"
"8278","transaction taking into account market prices and trends, the"
"8279","reputation, experience and financial stability of the broker or"
"8280","dealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the broker"
"8281","or dealer in other transactions. Subject to such policies as the"
"8282","Trustees of the Fund may determine, the Manager will not be"
"8283","deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty"
"8284","created by this Contract or otherwise solely by reason of its"
"8285","having caused the Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides"
"8286","brokerage and research services to the Manager an amount of"
"8287","commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in"
"8288","excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would"
"8289","have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Manager"
"8290","determines in good faith that such amount of commission was"
"8291","reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research"
"8292","services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in terms of"
"8293","either that particular transaction or the Managers overall"
"8294","responsibilities with respect to the Fund and to other clients of"
"8295","the Manager as to which the Manager exercises investment"
"8296","discretion. The Manager agrees that in connection with purchases"
"8297","or sales of portfolio investments for the Funds account, neither"
"8298","the Manager nor any officer, director, employee or agent of the"
"8299","Manager shall act as a principal or receive any commission other"
"8300","than as provided in Section 3."
"8301","      (d)	The Fund will pay or reimburse the Manager for the"
"8302","compensation in whole or in part of such officers of the Fund and"
"8303","persons assisting them as may be determined from time to time by"
"8304","the Trustees of the Fund. The Fund will also pay or reimburse the"
"8305","Manager for all or part of the cost of suitable office space,"
"8306","utilities, support services and equipment attributable to such"
"8307","officers and persons as may be determined in each case by the"
"8308","Trustees of the Fund. The Fund will pay the fees, if any, of the"
"8309","Trustees of the Fund."
"8310","      (e)	The Manager will not be obligated to pay any expenses"
"8311","of or for the Fund not expressly assumed by the Manager pursuant"
"8312","to this Section 1 other than as provided in Section 3."
"8313","      (f)	Subject to the prior approval of a majority of the"
"8314","Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who are not"
"8315","interested persons and, to the extent required by the 1940 Act"
"8316","and the rules and regulations under the 1940 Act, subject to any"
"8317","applicable guidance or interpretation of the Securities and"
"8318","Exchange Commission or its staff, by the shareholders of the Fund,"
"8319","the Manager may, from time to time, delegate to a subadviser or"
"8320","subadministrator any of the Managers duties under this Contract,"
"8321","including the management of all or a portion of the assets being"
"8322","managed. In all instances, however, the Manager must oversee the"
"8323","provision of delegated services, the Manager must bear the"
"8324","separate costs of employing any subadviser or subadministrator,"
"8325","and no delegation will relieve the Manager of any of its"
"8326","obligations under this Contract."
"8327","2.	OTHER AGREEMENTS, ETC."
"8328","      It is understood that any of the shareholders, Trustees,"
"8329","officers and employees of the Fund may be a shareholder, director,"
"8330","officer or employee of, or be otherwise interested in, the"
"8331","Manager, and in any person controlled by or under common control"
"8332","with the Manager, and that the Manager and any person controlled"
"8333","by or under common control with the Manager may have an interest"
"8334","in the Fund. It is also understood that the Manager and any"
"8335","person controlled by or under common control with the Manager may"
"8336","have advisory, management, service or other contracts with other"
"8337","organizations and persons and may have other interests and"

"8339","3.	COMPENSATION TO BE PAID BY THE FUND TO THE MANAGER."
"8340","      The Fund will pay to the Manager as compensation for the"
"8341","Managers services rendered, for the facilities furnished and for"

"8343","and (c) of Section 1, a fee, based on the Funds Average Net"
"8344","Assets, computed and paid monthly at the annual rates set forth"
"8345","on Schedule B attached to this Contract, as from time to time"
"8346","amended. The Funds Average Net Assets means the average of all of"
"8347","the determinations of the Funds net asset value at the close of"
"8348","business on each business day during each month while this"
"8349","Contract is in effect. The fee is payable for each month within"
"8350","15 days after the close of the month."
"8351","      The fees payable by the Fund to the Manager pursuant to this"
"8352","Section 3 will be reduced by any commissions, fees, brokerage or"
"8353","similar payments received by the Manager or any affiliated person"
"8354","of the Manager in connection with the purchase and sale of"
"8355","portfolio investments of the Fund, less any direct expenses"
"8356","approved by the Trustees incurred by the Manager or any"
"8357","affiliated person of the Manager in connection with obtaining"
"8358","such payments."
"8359","      In the event that expenses of the Fund for any fiscal year"
"8360","exceed the expense limitation on investment company expenses"
"8361","imposed by any statute or regulatory authority of any"
"8362","jurisdiction in which shares of the Fund are qualified for offer"
"8363","or sale, the compensation due the Manager for such fiscal year"
"8364","will be reduced by the amount of excess by a reduction or refund"
"8365","thereof. In the event that the expenses of the Fund exceed any"
"8366","expense limitation which the Manager may, by written notice to"
"8367","the Fund, voluntarily declare to be effective subject to such"
"8368","terms and conditions as the Manager may prescribe in such notice,"
"8369","the compensation due the Manager will be reduced, and if"
"8370","necessary, the Manager will assume expenses of the Fund, to the"
"8371","extent required by the terms and conditions of such expense"
"8372","limitation."
"8373","      If the Manager serves for less than the whole of a month,"
"8374","the foregoing compensation will be prorated."
"8375","4.	ASSIGNMENT TERMINATES THIS CONTRACT; AMENDMENTS OF THIS"
"8376","CONTRACT."
"8377","      This Contract will automatically terminate, without the"
"8378","payment of any penalty, in the event of its assignment, provided"
"8379","that no delegation of responsibilities by the Manager pursuant to"
"8380","Section 1(f) will be deemed to constitute an assignment. No"
"8381","provision of this Contract may be changed, waived, discharged or"
"8382","terminated orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by"
"8383","the party against which enforcement of the change, waiver,"
"8384","discharge or termination is sought. No amendment of this Contract"
"8385","is effective until approved in a manner consistent with the 1940"
"8386","Act, the rules and regulations under the 1940 Act and any"

"8388","Exchange Commission or its staff."
"8389","5.	EFFECTIVE PERIOD AND TERMINATION OF THIS CONTRACT."
"8390","      This Contract is effective upon its execution and will"
"8391","remain in full force and effect as to a Fund continuously"
