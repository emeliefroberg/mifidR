"539","Report of Independent"
"540"," Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"541","To the Shareholders and"
"542","Board of Directors of"
"543","Federated High Income Bond Fund, Inc."
"544","In planning and performing"
"545","our audits of the financial"
"546","statements of Federated High"
"547","Income Bond Fund, Inc."
"548","(the Fund) as of and for"
"549"," the year ended March 31,"
"550","2010, in"
"551","accordance with the standards"
"552","of the Public Company Accounting"
"553","Oversight Board"
"554","(United States), we considered"
"555","the Fund's internal control over"
"556","financial reporting,"
"557","including controls over"
"558","safeguarding securities, as"
"559","a basis for designing our auditing"
"560","procedures for the purpose"
"561","of expressing our opinion on"
"562"," the financial statements and to"
"563","comply with the requirements"
"564"," of Form N-SAR, but not for"
"565","the purpose of expressing an"
"566","opinion on the effectiveness"
"567","of the Fund's internal control"
"568","over financial reporting."
"569","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"570","The management of the Fund is"
"571","responsible for establishing"
"572","and maintaining effective"
"573","internal control over financial"
"574"," reporting. In fulfilling this"
"575"," responsibility, estimates and"
"576","judgments by management are"
"577","required to assess the expected"
"578"," benefits and related costs"
"579","of controls. A company's internal"
"580"," control over financial"
"581","reporting is a process designed to"
"582","provide reasonable assurance"
"583","regarding the reliability of"
"584","financial reporting and the"
"585","preparation of financial statements"
"586"," for external purposes in"
"587","accordance with generally"
"588","accepted accounting principles."
"589","  A company's internal control"
"590","over financial reporting"
"591","includes those policies and"
"592","procedures that (1) pertain"
"593"," to the maintenance of records that,"
"594","in reasonable detail, accurately"
"595"," and fairly reflect the transactions"
"596","and dispositions of the"
"597","assets of the company; (2) provide"
"598"," reasonable assurance that"
"599","transactions are recorded as"
"600","necessary to permit preparation"
"601","of financial statements in"
"602","accordance with generally"
"603","accepted accounting principles,"
"604"," and that receipts and"
"605","expenditures of the company are"
"606","being made only in accordance"
"607","with authorizations of management"
"608","and directors of the"
"609","company; and (3) provide"
"610","reasonable assurance regarding"
"611"," prevention or timely detection"
"612","of unauthorized acquisition,"
"613"," use or disposition of a"
"614","company's assets that could have a"
"615","material effect on the financial statements."
"616","Because of its inherent"
"617"," limitations, internal control"
"618"," over financial reporting may not"
"619","prevent or detect misstatements."
"620"," Also, projections of any"
"621","evaluation of effectiveness to"
"622","future periods are subject to"
"623","the risk that controls may"
"624"," become inadequate because of"
"625","changes in conditions, or that"
"626"," the degree of compliance with"
"627","the policies or procedures"
"628","may deteriorate."
"629","A deficiency in internal control"
"630"," over financial reporting exists"
"631"," when the design or"
"632","operation of a control does not"
"633"," allow management or employees,"
"634","in the normal course of"
"635","performing their assigned functions,"
"636"," to prevent or detect misstatements"
"637","on a timely basis."
"638","A material weakness is a deficiency,"
"639"," or a combination of deficiencies,"
"640"," in internal control"
"641","over financial reporting, such that"
"642","there is a reasonable possibility"
"643","that a material"
"644","misstatement of the company's annual"
"645","or interim financial statements will not be"
"646","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"647","Our consideration of the Fund's"
"648","internal control over financial"
"649","reporting was for the"
"650","limited purpose described in the"
"651","first paragraph and would not"
"652","necessarily disclose all"
"653","deficiencies in internal control"
"654","that might be material weaknesses"
"655"," under standards"
"656","established by the Public Company"
"657","Accounting Oversight Board (United States)."
"658","However, we noted no deficiencies"
"659","in the Fund's internal control over"
"660"," financial reporting"
"661","and its operation, including controls"
"662"," over safeguarding securities that"
"663","we consider to be a"
"664","material weakness as defined above"
"665","as of March 31, 2010."
"666","This report is intended solely for"
"667","the information and use of management"
"668","and the Board"
"669","of Directors of the Fund and the"
"670","Securities and Exchange Commission"
"671","and is not"

"685","SUB-ITEM 77-E   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"
"686","Since October 2003, Federated and"
"687"," related entities (collectively,"
"688","Federated) and various"
"689","Federated-sponsored mutual funds"
"690"," (Funds) have been named as"
"691"," defendants in several class"
"692"," action"
"693","lawsuits now pending in the"
"694","United States District Court"
"695","for the District of Maryland."
"696"," The lawsuits were"
"697","purportedly filed on behalf"
"698"," of people who purchased,"
"699","owned and/or redeemed shares"
"700","of certain Funds"
"701","during specified periods"
"702","beginning November 1, 1998."
"703","The suits are generally similar"
"704","in alleging that"
"705","Federated engaged in illegal"
"706","and improper trading practices"
"707"," including market timing and"
"708","late trading in"
"709","concert with certain"
"710","institutional traders, which"
"711"," allegedly caused financial"
"712"," injury to the mutual fund"
"713","shareholders. Federated"
"714","without admitting the validity"
"715"," of any claim has reached a"
"716","preliminary settlement"
"717","with the Plaintiffs in these"
"718"," cases. Any settlement would"
"719","have to be approved by the Court."
"720","     Federated entities have"
"721","also been named as defendants"
"722"," in several additional lawsuits"
"723"," that are now"
"724","pending in the United States"
"725","District Court for the Western"
"726","District of Pennsylvania. These"
"727","lawsuits have"
"728","been consolidated into a single"
"729","action alleging excessive"
"730","advisory fees involving one of"
"731"," the Funds."
"732","     The Board of the Funds"
"733"," retained the law firm of"
"734"," Dickstein Shapiro LLP to"
"735","represent the Funds in"
"736","each of the lawsuits described"
"737","in the preceding two paragraphs."
"738"," Federated and the Funds, and their"
"739","respective counsel, have been"
"740","defending this litigation, and"
"741"," none of the Funds remains a"
"742","defendant in"
"743","any of the lawsuits. Additional"
"744"," lawsuits based upon similar"
"745","allegations may be filed in"
"746","the future. The"
"747","potential impact of these lawsuits,"
"748"," all of which seek monetary"
"749","damages, attorneys' fees and expenses,"
"750","and future potential similar"
"751"," suits is uncertain. Although"
"752"," we do not believe that these"
"753"," lawsuits will have a"
"754","material adverse effect on the"
"755"," Funds, there can be no"
"756","assurance that these suits,"
"757","ongoing adverse"
"758","publicity and/or other developments"
"759"," resulting from the allegations"
"760","in these matters will not result in"
"761","increased redemptions, or reduced"
"762"," sales of shares of the Funds or"
"763"," other adverse consequences for the"
"764","Funds."
