"2568","First Investors Equity Funds"
"2569","110 Wall Street"
"2570","New York, New York 10005"
"2571","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of First"
"2572","Investors Equity Funds (comprising, respectively, the Total Return Fund,"
"2573","Equity Income Fund, Growth & Income Fund, Global Fund, Select Growth Fund,"
"2574","Opportunity Fund, Special Situations Fund, and International Fund)"
"2575","(the Funds),as of and for the year ended September 30, 2012, in"
"2576","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"2577","Board (United States), we considered its internal control over financial"
"2578","reporting, including control activities for safeguarding securities, in"
"2579","order to determine our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"2580","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2581","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"2582","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"2583","reporting.   Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2584","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"2585","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.   In"
"2586","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"2587","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"2588","A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"2589","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"2590","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"2591","external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"2592","principles.   A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"2593","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"2594","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"2595","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"2596","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"2597","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"2598","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company"
"2599","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"2600","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"2601","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"2602","disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on"
"2603","the financial statements."
"2604","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2605","may not prevent or detect misstatements.   Also, projections of any"
"2606","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that"
"2607","controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that"
"2608","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2609","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2610","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,"
"2611","in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or"
"2612","detect misstatements on a timely basis.   A material weakness is a"
"2613","deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"2614","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"2615","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial"
"2616","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."

"2621","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting"
"2622","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"2623","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"2624","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"2625","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).   However, we noted no"
"2626","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and"
"2627","its operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, which we"
"2628","consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above, as of September"
"2629","30, 2012."

"2672","Item 77E  Legal Proceedings 	Equity Funds N-SAR Filing		9/30/12"
"2673","The Blue Chip and Equity Income Funds have been named, and have received notice"
"2674","that they may be putative members of the proposed defendant class of"
"2675","shareholders, in a lawsuit filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the"
"2676","District of Delaware on November 1, 2010, by the Official Committee of"
"2677","Unsecured Creditors of Tribune Company (the Committee).  The Committee is"
"2678","seeking to recover all payments made to beneficial owners of common stock in"
"2679","connection with a leveraged buyout of the Tribune Company (LBO), including"
"2680","payments made in connection with a 2007 tender offer into which the Blue Chip"
"2681","and Equity Income Funds tendered their shares of common stock of the Tribune"
"2682","Company.  On December 9, 2011, the Blue Chip Fund was reorganized into the"
"2683","Growth & Income Fund pursuant to a Plan of Reorganization and Termination,"
"2684","whereby all of the assets of the Blue Chip Fund were transferred to the"
"2685","Growth & Income Fund, the Growth & Income Fund assumed all of the liabilities"
"2686","of the Blue Chip Fund, including any contingent liabilities with respect to"
"2687","pending or threatened litigation or actions, and shareholders of Blue Chip"
"2688","Fund became shareholders of Growth & Income Fund.  The adversary proceeding by"
"2689","the Committee has been stayed since it was filed (other than for limited"
"2690","discovery and service of the complaint).  The adversary proceeding brought by"
"2691","the Committee has been transferred to the Southern District of New York and"
"2692","consolidated with other similar suits as discussed below.   In addition, on"
"2693","June 2, 2011, the Blue Chip and Equity Income Funds were named as defendants"
"2694","in a lawsuit brought in connection with the Tribune Company's LBO by Deutsche"
"2695","Bank Trust Company Americas, in its capacity as successor indenture trustee for"
"2696","a certain series of Senior Notes, Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, in"
"2697","its capacity as successor indenture trustee for a certain series of Senior"
"2698","Notes, and Wilmington Trust Company, in its capacity as successor indenture"
"2699","trustee for the PHONES Notes (together, the Bondholder Plaintiffs) in the"
"2700","Supreme Court of the State of New York.  This suit has been removed to the"
"2701","United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and"
"2702","consolidated with other substantially similar suits against other former"
"2703","Tribune shareholders.  The Bondholder Plaintiffs also seek to recover payments"
"2704","of the proceeds of the LBO.  The extent of the Funds' potential liability in"
"2705","any such actions has not been determined.  The Funds have been advised by"
"2706","counsel that the Funds could be held liable to return all or part of the"
"2707","proceeds received in any of these actions, as well as interest and court costs,"
"2708","even though the Funds had no knowledge of, or participation in, any misconduct."
"2709","The Equity Income Fund received proceeds of $1,526,566 in connection with the"
"2710","LBO, representing 0.38% of its net assets as of September 30, 2012.  The Blue"
"2711","Chip Fund received proceeds of $790,772 in connection with the LBO,"
"2712","representing 0.06% of the net assets of Growth & Income Fund as of September"
"2713","30, 2012.  The Equity Income and Growth & Income Funds cannot predict the"
"2714","outcomes of these proceedings, and thus have not accrued any of the amounts"
"2715","sought in the various actions in the accompanying financial statements."
