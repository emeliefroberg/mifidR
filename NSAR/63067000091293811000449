"627","                          INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT"
"628","         INVESTMENT ADVISORY  AGREEMENT,  dated this 29th day of March, 2011, by"
"629","and between MFS SERIES TRUST XVI, a Massachusetts  business trust (the Trust),"
"630","on behalf of its series of shares  (the  Fund)  listed on  Appendix A attached"
"631","hereto, and MASSACHUSETTS  FINANCIAL  SERVICES COMPANY,  a Delaware  corporation"
"632","(the Adviser)."
"633","                                   WITNESSETH:"
"634","         WHEREAS,  the Trust is engaged in  business  as an  investment  company"
"635","registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940; and"
"636","         WHEREAS,  the Adviser is willing to provide  services to the Fund on"
"637","the terms and conditions  hereinafter set forth;"
"638","         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements"
"639","of the parties  hereto as herein set forth,  the parties  covenant  and agree as"
"640","follows:"
"641","         Article 1. Duties of the  Adviser.  (a) The Adviser  shall  provide the"
"642","Fund with such investment  advice and supervision as the latter may from time to"
"643","time consider  necessary for the proper  supervision of its assets.  The Adviser"
"644","shall  act  as  investment  adviser  to  the  Fund  and as  such  shall  furnish"
"645","continuously  an investment  program and shall  determine from time to time what"
"646","securities or other instruments  shall be purchased,  sold or exchanged and what"
"647","portion of the assets of the Fund shall be held  uninvested,  subject  always to"
"648","the restrictions of the Trust's Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, dated"
"649","December 29, 2010, and By-Laws, each as amended from time to time (respectively,"
"650","the  Declaration  and the  By-Laws),  to the  provisions  of the  Investment"
"651","Company Act of 1940 and the Rules,  Regulations and orders thereunder and to the"
"652","Fund's  then-current  Prospectus  and Statement of Additional  Information.  The"
"653","Adviser  also shall  exercise  voting  rights,  rights to  consent to  corporate"
"654","actions and any other rights  pertaining to the Fund's  portfolio  securities in"
"655","accordance  with the  Adviser's  policies  and  procedures  as  presented to the"
"656","Trustees  of the  Trust  from time to time.  Should  the  Trustees  at any time,"
"657","however, make any definite  determination as to the investment policy and notify"
"658","the Adviser thereof in writing, the Adviser shall be bound by such determination"
"659","for the period,  if any,  specified in such notice or until  similarly  notified"
"660","that such determination shall be revoked."
"661","         (b) The Adviser shall take, on behalf of the Fund, all actions which it"
"662","deems  necessary to implement  the  investment  policies  determined as provided"
"663","above,  and in  particular  to place  all  orders  for the  purchase  or sale of"
"664","portfolio securities or other instruments for the Fund's account with brokers or"
"665","dealers  selected by it, and to that end, the Adviser is authorized as the agent"
"666","of the  Fund  to  give  instructions  to the  Custodian  of the  Fund  as to the"
"667","deliveries  of  securities  or other  instruments  and  payments of cash for the"
"668","account of the Fund. In connection with the selection of such brokers or dealers"
"669","and the placing of such orders, the Adviser is directed to seek for the Fund the"
"670","best overall price and execution  available from  responsible  brokerage  firms,"
"671","taking  account  of  all  factors  it  deems  relevant,   including  by  way  of"
"672","illustration:  price; the size of the transaction;  the nature of the market for"
"673","the  security;  the  amount of the  commission;  the  timing  and  impact of the"
"674","transaction  taking  into  account  market  prices and trends;  the  reputation,"
"675","experience  and financial  stability of the broker or dealer  involved;  and the"
"676","quality of services rendered by the broker or dealer in other  transactions.  In"
"677","fulfilling  this  requirement,  the  Adviser  shall not be deemed to have  acted"
"678","unlawfully or to have breached any duty, created by this Agreement or otherwise,"
"679","solely  by  reason of its  having  caused  the Fund to pay a broker or dealer an"
"680","amount of  commission  for effecting a securities  transaction  in excess of the"
"681","amount of commission  another  broker or dealer would have charged for effecting"
"682","that  transaction,  if the Adviser  determined in good faith that such amount of"
"683","commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research"
"684","services  provided  by such  broker or  dealer,  viewed in terms of either  that"
"685","particular transaction or the Adviser's overall responsibilities with respect to"
"686","the Fund and to other  clients of the Adviser as to which the Adviser  exercises"
"687","investment  discretion.  Subject to  seeking  the best  price and  execution  as"
"688","described above,  and in accordance with applicable  rules and regulations,  the"
"689","Adviser also is authorized  to consider  sales of shares of the Fund or of other"
"690","funds or  accounts of the  Adviser as a factor in the  selection  of brokers and"
"691","dealers."
"692","         (c)  The  Adviser  may  from  time to time  enter  into  sub-investment"
"693","advisory  agreements  with  respect  to the  Fund  with  one or more  investment"
"694","advisers with such terms and conditions as the Adviser may  determine,  provided"
"695","that such  sub-investment  advisory  agreements have been approved in accordance"
"696","with applicable  provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and any rules,"
"697","regulations  or orders of the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  thereunder."
"698","Subject to the  provisions of Article 6, the Adviser shall not be liable for any"
"699","error of judgment or mistake of law by any  sub-adviser  or for any loss arising"
"700","out of any investment  made by any sub-adviser or for any act or omission in the"
"701","execution and management of the Fund by any sub-adviser."
"702","         Article 2.  Allocation of Charges and  Expenses.  (a) The Adviser shall"
"703","furnish at its own expense  investment  advisory  and  administrative  services,"
"704","office  space,  equipment  and clerical  personnel  necessary  for servicing the"
"705","investments  of the  Fund  and  maintaining  its  organization,  and  investment"
"706","advisory  facilities  and executive and  supervisory  personnel for managing the"
"707","investments  and effecting the portfolio  transactions  of the Fund. The Adviser"
"708","shall arrange, if desired by the Trust, for directors, officers and employees of"

"779","further  acknowledges  that it is  possible  that,  based  on  their  investment"
"780","objectives and policies, certain funds or accounts managed by the Adviser or its"
"781","affiliates  may at times  take  investment  positions  or engage  in  investment"

"789","opportunities  to sell securities or other  investments  shall be allocated in a"
"790","manner  believed by the Adviser to be fair and  equitable  to each  entity.  The"

"792","the position that may be acquired or disposed of for the Fund."
"793","         (c) It is understood  that the Trustees,  officers and  shareholders of"
"794","the Trust are or may be or  become  interested  in the  Adviser,  as  directors,"
"795","officers,  employees, or otherwise and that directors, officers and employees of"

"799","Massachusetts  Financial  Services, MFS or any derivatives  thereof or logos"
"800","associated  with those names  (collectively,  the MFS  Marks) are the valuable"
"801","property of the Adviser and its affiliates. The Adviser grants the Trust and the"
"802","Fund a non-exclusive and  non-transferable  right and sub-license to use the MFS"
"803","Marks only so long as the Adviser serves as investment  adviser to the Trust and"
"804","the Fund.  The Trust agrees that if the Adviser for any reason no longer  serves"
"805","as  investment  adviser  to the Fund,  and the  Adviser so  requests,  that Fund"
"806","promptly  shall  cease  to use  the MFS  Marks  and  promptly  shall  amend  its"
"807","registration  statement to delete any references to the MFS Marks. Likewise, the"
"808","Trust agrees that if the Adviser for any reason no longer  serves as  investment"
"809","adviser  to any Fund of the  Trust,  and the  Adviser  so  requests,  the  Trust"
"810","promptly  shall  cease  to use  the MFS  Marks  and  promptly  shall  amend  its"
"811","Declaration  of Trust to  delete  any  references  to the MFS  Marks.  The Trust"
"812","acknowledges  that the Adviser may permit other  clients to use the MFS Marks in"
"813","their names or other material.  For purposes of this Article, the Trust shall be"
"814","deemed to have taken the  required  action  promptly  if such  action is taken"
"815","within 90 days of the Adviser no longer serving as the investment adviser to the"
"816","Fund of the Trust,  or from the date of the Adviser's  request,  as the case may"
"817","be."
"818","         Article 9. Duration,  Termination and Amendment of this Agreement.  (a)"
"819","This  Agreement  shall  become  effective  with respect to the Trust on the date"
"820","first written  above,  and shall become  effective  with respect to the Fund, if"
"821","approved by the shareholders of the Fund, on the Effective Date for the Fund, as"
"822","set forth in Appendix A attached hereto. Thereafter,  this Agreement will remain"

"828","of voting on such approval,  and (ii) by the Board of Trustees of the Trust,  or"
"829","by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund."
"830","         (b) This  Agreement may be terminated as to the Trust or as to the Fund"

majority of the outstanding  voting  securities of the Fund, or by the Adviser,"
"832","in each case on not more than sixty  days' nor less than  thirty  days'  written"
"833","notice to the other party. This Agreement shall  automatically  terminate in the"
"834","event of its assignment."
"835","         (c) This Agreement may be amended with respect to the Fund only if such"

"846","approved as to any other Fund, or (ii) that the  approval,  renewal or amendment"
"847","has not  been  approved  by the vote of a  majority  of the  outstanding  voting"
"848","securities of the Trust as a whole."
"849","         Article  10.  Scope  of  Trust's  Obligations.  A copy  of the  Trust's"

"852","out of  this  Agreement  are  not  binding  upon  any of the  Trust's  Trustees,"
"853","officers, employees, agents or shareholders individually, but are binding solely"
"854","upon the assets and property of the Trust.  If this Agreement is executed by the"
"855","Trust on behalf of one or more Funds, the Adviser further  acknowledges that the"
"856","assets  and  liabilities  of the Fund are  separate  and  distinct  and that the"
"857","obligations of or arising out of this Agreement  concerning the Fund are binding"
"858","solely  upon the  assets  or  property  of the Fund and not upon the  assets  or"

approved  at least  annually,  vote of a majority  of the  outstanding  voting
securities,  assignment,  affiliated  person, and interested person, when"
"861","used in this Agreement,  shall have the respective meanings specified, and shall"
"862","be construed in a manner consistent with, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and"
"863","the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Any question of interpretation"

"945","             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"946","To the Trustees of Shareholders of"
"947","MFS Global Multi-Asset Fund"
"948","In planning and performing  our audit of the financial  statements of MFS Global"
"949","Multi-Asset Fund (the Fund)(one of the portfolios  comprising MFS Series Trust"
"950","XVI) as of and for the  period  ended  June 30,  2011,  in  accordance  with the"
"951","standards of the Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board (United States),  we"
"952","considered  the Fund's  internal  control over  financial  reporting,  including"
"953","controls  over  safeguarding  securities,  as a basis for designing our auditing"
"954","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"955","and to comply with the  requirements  of Form N-SAR,  but not for the purpose of"
"956","expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Fund's internal control over"
"957","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"958","The  management of the Fund is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining"
"959","effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.   In  fulfilling  this"
"960","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"961","expected  benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's  internal control"
"962","over financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance"
"963","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"964","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"965","accounting  principles.  A company's  internal control over financial  reporting"
"966","includes those policies and  procedures  that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of"
"967","records  that,  in  reasonable   detail,   accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the"
"968","transactions  and  dispositions  of the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide"
"969","reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded as  necessary to permit"
"970","preparation  of financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted"
"971","accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are"
"972","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"973","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"974","detection of unauthorized acquisition,  use or disposition of a company's assets"
"975","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"976","Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting"
"977","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"978","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"979","inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance"
"980","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"981","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"982","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,  in the normal"
"983","course  of  performing   their   assigned   functions,   to  prevent  or  detect"
"984","misstatements  on a timely  basis.  A material  weakness is a  deficiency,  or a"
"985","combination of deficiencies,  in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"986","that  there is a  reasonable  possibility  that a material  misstatement  of the"
"987","company's  annual or  interim  financial  statements  will not be  prevented  or"
"988","detected on a timely basis."
"989","<PAGE>"
"990","Our  consideration of the Fund's internal  control over financial  reporting was"
"991","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in the  first  paragraph  and  would  not"
"992","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"993","weaknesses  under  standards   established  by  the  Public  Company  Accounting"
"994","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"995","internal control over financial reporting and its operation,  including controls"
"996","over  safeguarding  securities  that we  consider  to be a material  weakness as"
"997","defined above as of June 30, 2011."
