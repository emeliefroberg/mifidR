"851","Astor Long/Short Fund,"

"854","Fund and"
"855","Board of Trustees of"

"857","Trust"
"858","In planning and"

"861","Astor Long/Short Fund,"
"862","Astor S.T.A.R. Fund and"
"863","the consolidated financial"
"864","statements of Astor Macro"

"866","series of Northern Lights"
"867","Fund Trust (the Funds),"
"868","as of and for the year"
"869","ended July 31, 2016, in"
"870","accordance with the"
"871","standards of the Public"
"872","Company Accounting"
"873","Oversight Board (United"
"874","States), we considered the"
"875","Funds' internal control"
"876","over financial reporting,"
"877","including controls over"
"878","safeguarding securities, as"
"879","a basis for designing our"
"880","auditing procedures for"
"881","the purpose of expressing"
"882","our opinion on the"
"883","financial statements and to"
"884","comply with the"
"885","requirements of Form N-"
"886","SAR, but not for the"
"887","purpose of expressing an"
"888","opinion on the"
"889","effectiveness of the"
"890","Funds' internal control"
"891","over financial reporting."
"892","Accordingly, we express"
"893","no such opinion."
"894","The management of the"
"895","Funds is responsible for"
"896","establishing and"
"897","maintaining effective"
"898","internal control over"
"899","financial reporting.  In"
"900","fulfilling this"
"901","responsibility, estimates"
"902","and judgments by"
"903","management are required"
"904","to assess the expected"
"905","benefits and related costs"
"906","of controls.  A fund's"
"907","internal control over"
"908","financial reporting is a"
"909","process designed to"
"910","provide reasonable"
"911","assurance regarding the"
"912","reliability of financial"
"913","reporting and the"
"914","preparation of financial"
"915","statements for external"
"916","purposes in accordance"
"917","with generally accepted"
"918","accounting principles"
"919","(GAAP).  A fund's"
"920","internal control over"
"921","financial reporting"
"922","includes those policies and"
"923","procedures that (1) pertain"
"924","to the maintenance of"
"925","records that, in reasonable"
"926","detail, accurately and"
"927","fairly reflect the"
"928","transactions and"
"929","dispositions of the assets"
"930","of the fund; (2) provide"
"931","reasonable assurance that"
"932","transactions are recorded"
"933","as necessary to permit"
"934","preparation of financial"
"935","statements in accordance"
"936","with GAAP, and that"
"937","receipts and expenditures"
"938","of the fund are being made"
"939","only in accordance with"
"940","authorizations of"
"941","management and trustees"
"942","of the fund; and (3)"
"943","provide reasonable"
"944","assurance regarding"
"945","prevention or timely"
"946","detection of unauthorized"
"947","acquisition, use or"
"948","disposition of a fund's"
"949","assets that could have a"
"950","material effect on the"
"951","financial statements."
"952","Because of its inherent"
"953","limitations, internal"
"954","control over financial"
"955","reporting may not prevent"
"956","or detect misstatements."
"957","Also, projections of any"
"958","evaluation of effectiveness"
"959","to future periods are"
"960","subject to the risk that"
"961","controls may become"
"962","inadequate because of"
"963","changes in conditions, or"
"964","that the degree of"
"965","compliance with the"
"966","policies or procedures"
"967","may deteriorate."
"968","A deficiency in internal"
"969","control over financial"
"970","reporting exists when the"
"971","design or operation of a"
"972","control does not allow"
"973","management or"
"974","employees, in the normal"
"975","course of performing their"
"976","assigned functions, to"
"977","prevent or detect"
"978","misstatements on a timely"
"979","basis.  A material"
"980","weakness is a deficiency,"
"981","or combination of"
"982","deficiencies, in internal"
"983","control over financial"
"984","reporting, such that there"
"985","is a reasonable possibility"
"986","that a material"
"987","misstatement of the"
"988","Funds' annual or interim"
"989","financial statements will"
"990","not be prevented or"
"991","detected on a timely basis."
"992","Our consideration of the"
"993","Funds' internal control"
"994","over financial reporting"
"995","was for the limited"
"996","purpose described in the"
"997","first paragraph and would"
"998","not necessarily disclose all"
"999","deficiencies in internal"
"1000","control that might be"
"1001","material weaknesses under"
"1002","standards established by"
"1003","the Public Company"
"1004","Accounting Oversight"
"1005","Board (United States)."
"1006","However, we noted no"
"1007","deficiencies in the Funds'"
"1008","internal control over"
"1009","financial reporting and its"
"1010","operation, including"
"1011","controls over safeguarding"
"1012","securities, that we"
"1013","consider to be a material"
"1014","weakness as defined"
"1015","above as of July 31, 2016."
"1016","This report is intended"
"1017","solely for the information"
"1018","and use of management"
"1019","and the Board of Trustees"
