"2945","for the period March 20, 2013 (commencement of operations) through March"
"2946","31, 2013 for BlackRock Allocation Target Shares: BATS P, in accordance"
"2947","with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"2948","(United States), we considered the Portfolios' internal control over"
"2949","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as"
"2950","a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2951","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with"
"2952","the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"2953","opinion on the effectiveness of the Portfolios' internal control over"
"2954","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2955","The management of the Portfolios is responsible for establishing and"
"2956","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"2957","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"2958","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"2959","controls.  A fund's internal control over financial reporting is a"
"2960","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"2961","reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial"
"2962","statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2963","accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"2964","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"2965","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"2966","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"2967","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"2968","to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with"
"2969","generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and"
"2970","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"2971","authorizations of management and directors of the fund; and (3) provide"
"2972","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"2973","unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets that"
"2974","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2975","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"2976","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of"
"2977","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"2978","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"2979","conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"2980","procedures may deteriorate."
"2981","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"2982","the design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"2983","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions,"
"2984","to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"2985","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"2986","control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"2987","possibility that a material misstatement of the fund's annual or interim"
"2988","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"2989","basis."
"2990","Our consideration of the Portfolios' internal control over financial"
"2991","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph"
"2992","and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control"
"2993","that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"2994","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we"
"2995","noted no deficiencies in the Portfolios' internal control over financial"
"2996","reporting and its operation, including controls for safeguarding"
"2997","securities, that we consider to be a material weakness, as defined"
"2998","above, as of March 31, 2013."

"3015","Policies with respect to security investments"
"3016","Effective November 30, 2012, the Fund's principal"
"3017","investment strategies were changed as follows:"
"3018","The Fund is intended to be used as part of a broader"
"3019","separately managed account program administered directly"
"3020","by BlackRock. The performance and objectives of the Fund"
"3021","should be evaluated only in the context of the investor's"
"3022","complete investment program. The Fund is not designed to"
"3023","be used as a stand-alone investment."
"3024","The Fund may invest in a portfolio of securities and"
"3025","other financial instruments, including derivative"
"3026","instruments, in an attempt to provide returns that are"
"3027","the inverse of its benchmark index, the Barclays US"
"3028","Treasury 7-10 Year Bond Index. The Fund's return is"
"3029","intended to move in the opposite direction of the return"
"3030","of a traditional fixed income fund. Unlike a traditional"
"3031","fixed income fund, the value of the Fund is expected to"
"3032","move in the same direction as that of interest rates. The"
"3033","value of a traditional fixed income fund generally drops"
"3034","as interest rates rise, however, it is expected that the"
"3035","Fund will provide positive returns in a rising interest"
"3036","rate environment. Under normal circumstances, the Fund"
"3037","maintains an average portfolio duration that is within"
"3038","20% of the inverse duration of its benchmark, as"
"3039","calculated by BlackRock. As of November 18, 2012, the"
"3040","average duration of the Fund's benchmark was 7.46 years,"
"3041","as calculated by BlackRock."
"3042","The Fund will seek to pursue its investment objective"
"3043","primarily by investing in derivative instruments that"
"3044","provide returns that are inverse to those available by"
"3045","investing directly in U.S. Treasury securities."
"3046","Derivative instruments that the Fund may invest in"
"3047","include, but are not limited to, futures (including U.S."
"3048","Treasury futures), options, forward contracts and/or"
"3049","swaps, including interest rate swaps, swaptions and total"
"3050","return swaps."
"3051","The Fund may also invest significantly in a variety of"
"3052","short-term fixed income instruments, including but not"
"3053","limited to, U.S. government securities, U.S. government"
"3054","agency securities, securities issued by U.S. government-"
"3055","sponsored enterprises and U.S. government"
"3056","instrumentalities, investment grade corporate bonds,"
"3057","asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities."
"3058","The Fund will invest in these short-term fixed income"
"3059","instruments in order to generate income to cover some or"
"3060","all of the costs associated with the Fund's derivative"
"3061","positions. The Fund will also invest a significant"
"3062","portion of its total assets in cash and cash equivalents"
"3063","to use for margin requirements for its derivative"
"3064","positions."
"3065","The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of"
"3066","portfolio instruments to achieve its investment"
"3067","objective."
"3068","The Fund is classified as non-diversified under the"
"3069","Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the"
"3070","Investment Company Act)."
"3071","Effective November 30, 2012, the Fund's fundamental"
"3072","investment restrictions were changed as follows:"
"3073","The Fund has adopted restrictions and policies relating"
"3074","to the investment of the Fund's assets and its"
"3075","activities. Certain of the restrictions are fundamental"
"3076","policies of the Fund and may not be changed without the"
"3077","approval of the holders of a majority of the Fund's"
"3078","outstanding voting securities (which for this purpose and"
"3079","under the Investment Company Act means the lesser of (i)"
"3080","67% of the shares represented at a meeting at which more"
"3081","than 50% of the outstanding shares are represented or"
"3082","(ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares)."
"3083","Under these fundamental investment restrictions, the Fund"
"3084","may not:"
"3085","(1) Concentrate its investments in a particular industry,"
"3086","as that term is used in the Investment Company Act."
"3087","(2) Borrow money, except as permitted under the"
"3088","Investment Company Act."
"3089","(3) Issue senior securities to the extent such issuance"
"3090","would violate the Investment Company Act."
"3091","(4) Purchase or hold real estate, except the Fund may"
"3092","purchase and hold securities or other instruments that"
"3093","are secured by, or linked to, real estate or interests"
"3094","therein, securities of real estate investment trusts,"
"3095","mortgage-related securities and securities of issuers"
"3096","engaged in the real estate business, and the Fund may"
"3097","purchase and hold real estate as a result of the"
"3098","ownership of securities or other instruments."
"3099","(5) Underwrite securities issued by others, except to the"
"3100","extent that the sale of portfolio securities by the Fund"
"3101","may be deemed to be an underwriting or as otherwise"
"3102","permitted by applicable law."
"3103","(6) Purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts,"
"3104","except as permitted by the Investment Company Act."
"3105","(7) Make loans to the extent prohibited by the Investment"
