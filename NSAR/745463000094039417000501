"1310","	WHEREAS, the Trust on behalf of the Fund has entered"
"1311","into an Investment Advisory and Administrative Agreement (the"
"1312","Advisory Agreement) with the Adviser, which provides that the"
"1313","Adviser shall be entitled to receive compensation at a certain"
"1314","rate; and"
"1315","       WHEREAS, the Adviser has offered to reduce such"
"1316","advisory fee rate, and the Trust has accepted such fee reduction,"
"1317","such fee reduction being effective as of November 1, 2016; and"
"1318","       WHEREAS, the Adviser and the Trust wish to"
"1319","memorialize said fee reduction in writing;"
"1320","	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual"
"1321","covenants and agreements contained herein and for other good"
"1322","and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby"
"1323","acknowledged, the Trust and the Adviser hereby jointly and"
"1324","severally agree as follows:"
"1325","1.	For so long as the Advisory Agreement shall remain in"

"1329","reduction schedule set forth on Exhibit A hereto."
"1330","2.	This Agreement may only be terminated or amended"
"1331","upon the mutual written consent of the Trust and the"
"1332","Adviser; provided, however, that (i) no termination of"
"1333","this Agreement shall be effective unless approved by the"

"1662","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"1663","To the Trustees of Eaton Vance Mutual Funds Trust and"
"1664","Shareholders of Parametric Commodity Strategy Fund:"
"1665","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"1666","Parametric Commodity Strategy Fund (the Fund) (one of the"
"1667","funds constituting Eaton Vance Mutual Funds Trust) as of and for"
"1668","the year ended December 31, 2016, in accordance with the"
"1669","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1670","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control over"
"1671","financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"1672","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1673","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"1674","and to comply with the requirements of Form N- SAR, but not for"
"1675","the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"1676","Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"1677","express no such opinion."
"1678","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1679","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"1680","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1681","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1682","related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over financial"
"1683","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1684","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"1685","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"1686","generally accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal"
"1687","control over financial reporting includes those policies and"
"1688","procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1689","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions"
"1690","and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"1691","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"1692","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"

"1694","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"

"1696","trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"

"1698","of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"1699","financial statements."
"1700","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"

"1703","subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"1704","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"1705","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1706","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when"
"1707","the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"1708","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1709","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A"
"1710","material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"

"1712","there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a"
"1713","fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented"
"1714","or detected on a timely basis."
"1715","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"

"1718","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"1719","standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"1720","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
