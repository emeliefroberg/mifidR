"16616","period) ended October 31, 2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"16617","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Funds'"
"16618","internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding"
"16619","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"16620","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"16621","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"16622","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"16623","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"16624","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"16625","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"16626","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"16627","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal"
"16628","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"16629","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"16630","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"16631","accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial"
"16632","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"16633","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"16634","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"16635","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"16636","permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally"
"16637","accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the"
"16638","company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"16639","directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"16640","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition"
"16641","of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"16642","statements."
"16643","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"16644","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"16645","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"16646","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"16647","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"16648","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"16649","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"16650","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to"
"16651","prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"16652","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over"
"16653","financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"16654","material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements"
"16655","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"16656","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"16657","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"16658","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"16659","material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"16660","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies"
"16661","in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"16662","including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a"
"16663","material weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2013."
"16664","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
"16665","the Board of Trustees of the Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission"

                               -----------------

   We are offering $1,000,000,000 principal amount of our 3.375% Notes due 2020
(the Notes).

   The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 3.375% per annum, accruing from
August 9, 2013 and payable semi-annually in arrears on each February 15 and
August 15, beginning on February 15, 2014 (long first coupon). The Notes will
mature on August 15, 2020. The Notes will be sold in denominations of $2,000
and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

   We may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time at the redemption price
described under Description of the Notes -- Optional Redemption.

   The Notes will be our unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all
of our other existing and future unsecured indebtedness. The Notes will be
structurally subordinated to secured and unsecured debt of our subsidiaries,
which is significant. The Notes are a new issue of securities with no
established trading market. We do not intend to apply for listing of the Notes
on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes in any automated
quotation system.

   Investing in the Notes involves risks. Before investing in any Notes offered
hereby, you should consider carefully each of the risk factors set forth in
Risk Factors beginning on page S-4 of this prospectus supplement, Part II,
Item 1A. of American International Group, Inc.'s (AIG) Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2013 and Part I, Item 1A. of
AIG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.

   Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any other regulatory body
has approved or disapproved of the Notes or passed upon the accuracy or
adequacy of this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus. Any
representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

                       ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT

   This document consists of two parts. The first part is this prospectus
supplement, which describes the specific terms of this offering. The second
part is the accompanying prospectus, which describes more general information
regarding AIG's securities, some of which does not apply to this offering. This
prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus are part of a
registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC) using the SEC's shelf registration rules. You should
read both this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, together
with additional information incorporated by reference herein and therein as
described under the heading Where You Can Find More Information in this
prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus.

   Unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context requires otherwise, all
references in this prospectus supplement to AIG, we, us, our or similar
references mean American International Group, Inc. and not its subsidiaries.

   If the information set forth in this prospectus supplement differs in any
way from the information set forth in the accompanying prospectus, you should
rely on the information set forth in this prospectus supplement. The
information contained in this prospectus supplement or the accompanying
prospectus or in the documents incorporated by reference herein and therein is
only accurate as of their respective dates.

          CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

   This prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and other
publicly available documents, including the documents incorporated herein and
therein by reference, may include, and officers and representatives of AIG may
from time to time make, projections, goals, assumptions and statements that may
constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These projections, goals, assumptions
and statements are not historical facts but instead represent only AIG's belief
regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently
uncertain and outside AIG's control. These projections, goals, assumptions and
statements include statements preceded by, followed by or including words such
as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, view, target or
estimate. These projections, goals, assumptions and statements may address,
among other things:

..   the monetization of AIG's interests in International Lease Finance
    Corporation (ILFC), including whether AIG's proposed sale of up to
    90 percent of ILFC will be completed and if completed, the timing and final
    terms of such sale;

..   AIG's exposures to subprime mortgages, monoline insurers, the residential
    and commercial real estate markets, state and municipal bond issuers and
    sovereign bond issuers;

..   AIG's exposure to European governments and European financial institutions;

..   AIG's strategy for risk management;

..   AIG's generation of deployable capital;

..   AIG's return on equity and earnings per share long-term aspirational goals;

..   AIG's strategies to grow net investment income, efficiently manage capital
    and reduce expenses;

..   AIG's strategies for customer retention, growth, product development,
    market position, financial results and reserves; and

..   the revenues and combined ratios of AIG's subsidiaries.

                                     S-ii

   It is possible that AIG's actual results and financial condition will
differ, possibly materially, from the results and financial condition indicated
in these projections, goals, assumptions and statements. Factors that could
cause AIG's actual results to differ, possibly materially, from those in the
specific projections, goals, assumptions and statements include:

..   changes in market conditions;

..   the occurrence of catastrophic events, both natural and man-made;

..   significant legal proceedings;

..   the timing and applicable requirements of any new regulatory framework to
    which AIG is subject as a savings and loan holding company, as a
    systemically important financial institution and as a global systemically
    important insurer;

..   concentrations in AIG's investment portfolios;

..   actions by credit rating agencies;

..   judgments concerning casualty insurance underwriting and insurance
    liabilities;

..   judgments concerning the recognition of deferred tax assets; and

..   such other factors discussed throughout the Risk Factors section of this
    prospectus supplement, throughout Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Part II,
    Item 1A. Risk Factors of AIG's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
    quarterly period ended June 30, 2013, throughout Part I, Item 2.

    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of AIG's Annual Report on Form 10-K

   AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to
update or alter any projections, goals, assumptions or other statements,
whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise.

                              Recent Developments

   On December 9, 2012, AIG, AIG Capital Corporation (Seller), a wholly-owned
direct subsidiary of AIG and the sole shareholder of ILFC, and Jumbo
Acquisition Limited (Purchaser) entered into a definitive agreement (the
Share Purchase Agreement) for the sale of 80.1 percent of the common stock of
ILFC for approximately $4.2 billion in cash (the ILFC Transaction). The Share
Purchase Agreement permits the Purchaser to elect to purchase an additional 9.9
percent of the common stock of ILFC for $522.5 million (the Option). On
June 15, 2013, AIG, Seller and Purchaser entered into an amendment (the
Amendment) to the Share Purchase Agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1,
dated May 10, 2013. The Amendment extended to July 31, 2013, the date on which
any of AIG, Seller or Purchaser may terminate the Share Purchase Agreement, as
amended, if the closing of the ILFC Transaction has not yet occurred. Under the
Amendment, AIG and Seller may pursue (but not enter into definitive
documentation for, or consummate) other offers for ILFC and may continue to
pursue (but not engage in widespread solicitation of orders for, or request
effectiveness of) the alternative of a public offering.

   On July 15, 2013, the Purchaser delivered notice that it intended to
exercise the Option, raising the size of the total purchase to 90 percent of
the common stock of ILFC.

   As of August 5, 2013, the closing of the ILFC Transaction has not occurred.
As a result, no assurance can be given that the Share Purchase Agreement will
not be terminated.

                              should consider carefully the specific risk

<PAGE>

                                 RISK FACTORS

   An investment in the Notes involves certain risks. You should carefully
consider the risks described below, in Part II, Item 1A. of AIG's Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2013 and in Part I,
Item 1A. of AIG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2012, as well as other information included, or incorporated by reference, in
this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, before purchasing
any Notes. Events relating to any of the following risks, or other risks and
uncertainties, could seriously harm our business, financial condition and
results of operations. In such a case, the trading value of the Notes could
decline, or we may be unable to meet our obligations under the Notes, which in
turn could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.

  The Notes are unsecured debt and will be effectively subordinated to any
  secured obligations we may incur.

   The Notes will be our unsecured obligations and will rank effectively junior
to any secured obligations we may incur, to the extent of the collateral
securing those obligations. For example, if we were unable to repay
indebtedness or meet other obligations under our secured debt, the holders of
that secured debt may have the right to foreclose upon and sell the assets that
secure that debt. In such an event, it is possible that we would not have
sufficient funds to pay amounts due on the Notes.

   In addition, if we are declared bankrupt, become insolvent or are liquidated
or reorganized, holders of our secured debt will be entitled to exercise the
remedies available to a secured lender under applicable law and pursuant to the
instruments governing such debt, and any of our secured indebtedness will be
entitled to be paid in part or in full, to the extent of our pledged assets or
the pledged assets of the guarantors securing that indebtedness before any
payment may be made with respect to the Notes from such pledged assets. Secured
lenders not paid in full from pledged assets shall be entitled to an unsecured
claim for the balance of their debt (or such lesser amount as any applicable
limited recourse may provide). Holders of the Notes will participate ratably in
our remaining assets with all holders of any unsecured indebtedness that does
not rank junior to the Notes, based upon the respective amounts owed to each
holder or creditor. In any of the foregoing events, there may not be sufficient
assets to pay amounts due on the Notes. As a result, holders of the Notes would
likely receive less, ratably, than holders of our secured indebtedness.

  The indenture relating to the Notes and the terms of the Notes contain
  limited protection for holders of the Notes.

   The indenture (described further in Description of the Notes below and
Description of Debt Securities AIG May Offer -- The Senior Debt Indenture in
the accompanying prospectus) under which the Notes will be issued and the terms
of the Notes offer limited protection to holders of the Notes. In particular,
the terms of the indenture and the terms of the Notes will not place any
restrictions on our or our subsidiaries' ability to:

..   engage in a change of control transaction;

..   subject to the covenant discussed under Description of the Notes --"
"17414","    Limitation on Liens Covenant, issue secured debt or secure existing
    unsecured debt;

..   issue debt securities or otherwise incur additional unsecured indebtedness
    or other obligations;

..   purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of capital stock or
    other securities ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes;

..   pay dividends;

..   sell assets; or

..   enter into transactions with related parties.

   Furthermore, the terms of the indenture and the terms of the Notes will not
protect holders of the Notes in the event that we experience changes (including
significant adverse changes) in our financial condition or results

                                      S-4

<PAGE>

of operations, as they will not require that we or our subsidiaries adhere to
any financial tests or ratios or specified levels of net worth, revenues,
income, cash flow or liquidity. In addition, the Notes do not provide for a
step-up in interest on, or any other protection against, a decline in our
credit ratings.

   Our ability to incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that
are not limited by the terms of the indenture or the Notes could negatively
affect the value of the Notes.

   In addition, our existing credit facilities include more protections for the
lenders thereunder than are available to holders of the Notes under the
indenture and the terms of the Notes. For example, subject to certain
exceptions, our existing credit facilities restrict our ability and the ability
of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur certain types of
liens, merge, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of our assets and
engage in transactions with affiliates. Our existing credit facilities also
require us to maintain a specified total consolidated net worth and
consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization. If we fail to
comply with those covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, an
event of default would result under our existing credit facilities, and the
lenders thereunder could, among other things, declare any outstanding
borrowings under our existing credit facilities immediately due and payable.
However, because the Notes do not contain similar covenants, such events may
not constitute an event of default under the Notes and the holders of the Notes
would not be able to accelerate the payment under the Notes. As a result,
holders of the Notes may be effectively subordinated to the lenders of our
existing credit facilities, and to new lenders or note holders, to the extent
the instruments they hold include similar protections.

  We and our subsidiaries have significant leverage and debt obligations.
  Payments on the Notes will depend on receipt of dividends and distributions
  from our subsidiaries, and the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the
  existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries.

   We are a holding company and we conduct substantially all of our operations
through subsidiaries. We are also permitted, subject to certain limitations
under our existing indebtedness and limits that may be imposed by regulatory
agencies, to obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of
credit to meet future financing needs. This would have the effect of increasing
our total leverage. Furthermore, subject to the covenant discussed under
Description of the Notes -- Limitation on Liens Covenant, the indenture
relating to the Notes does not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring
additional secured or unsecured indebtedness. As of June 30, 2013, after giving
effect to the offering of the Notes, we would have had approximately $43.6
billion of consolidated debt (including approximately $2.1 billion of
subsidiary debt obligations not guaranteed by us).

   We depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our
subsidiaries to fund payments on the Notes. Further, the majority of our
investments are held by our regulated subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries may be
limited in their ability to make dividend payments or advance funds to us in
the future because of the need to support their own capital levels or because
of regulatory limits.

   Our right to participate in any distribution of assets from any subsidiary
upon the subsidiary's liquidation or otherwise is subject to the prior claims
of any preferred equity interest holders and creditors of that subsidiary,
except to the extent that we are recognized as a creditor of that subsidiary.
To the extent that we are a creditor of a subsidiary, our claims would be
subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and/or
any indebtedness of that subsidiary senior to that held by us. As a result, the
Notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities
of our subsidiaries. You should look only to the assets of American
International Group, Inc. as the source of payment for the Notes, and not those
of our subsidiaries.

  The trading market for the Notes may be limited and you may be unable to sell
  your Notes at a price that you deem sufficient.

   The Notes being offered by this prospectus supplement and the accompanying
prospectus are new issues of securities for which there is currently no active
trading market. We do not intend to list the Notes on any

                                      S-5

<PAGE>

securities exchange or include the Notes in any automated quotation system. The
underwriters currently intend, but are not obligated, to make a market for the
Notes and may cease doing so at any time. As a result, an active trading market
may not develop for the Notes, or if one does develop, it may not be sustained.
If an active trading market fails to develop or cannot be sustained, you may
not be able to resell your Notes at their fair market value or at all.

   Whether or not a trading market for the Notes develops, neither we nor the
underwriters can provide any assurance about the market price of the Notes.
Several factors, many of which are beyond our control, might influence the
market value of the Notes, including:

..   our creditworthiness and financial condition (whether actual or perceived);

..   actions by credit rating agencies;

..   the market for similar securities;

..   prevailing interest rates; and

..   economic, financial, geopolitical, regulatory and judicial events that
    affect us, the industries and markets in which we are doing business, and
    the financial markets generally, such as adverse European economic and
    financial conditions related to sovereign debt issues in certain countries,
    and concerns regarding the European Union or geopolitical or military
    crises.

   Financial market conditions and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in
the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Such fluctuations could
have an adverse effect on the price of the Notes.

   As a result of one or more of those factors, Notes that an investor
purchases may trade at a discount to the price that the investor paid for such
Notes.

  There are potential conflicts of interest between investors in the Notes and
  the quotation agent.

   AIG Markets, Inc., our subsidiary, will serve as the quotation agent in
connection with any redemption of the Notes. The quotation agent will determine
the redemption price of the Notes. The quotation agent will exercise discretion
and judgment in performing these duties. Absent manifest error, all
determinations by the quotation agent will be final and binding on investors,
without any liability on our part. The exercise of this discretion by the
quotation agent could adversely affect the redemption price of the Notes.
Investors will not be entitled to any compensation from us for any loss
suffered as a result of any determinations by the quotation agent, even though
the quotation agent may have a conflict of interest at the time of such
determinations.

  Our Credit Ratings May Not Reflect All Risks of an Investment in the Notes

   Our credit ratings are an assessment of our ability to pay our obligations.
Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally
affect the market value of the Notes. Our credit ratings, however, may not
reflect the potential impact of risks related to market or other factors
discussed in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus on the
value of the Notes.

                                USE OF PROCEEDS

   The net proceeds to us from the sale of the Notes, after deduction of
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us, are anticipated to be approximately $995,250,000. We intend to use the
net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, which are
currently expected to include the retirement of our debt.

                           DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES

   We have summarized below certain terms of the 3.375% Notes due 2020, which
we refer to in this prospectus supplement as the Notes. This summary
supplements and amends the general description of the Notes contained in the
accompanying prospectus. Any information regarding the Notes contained in this
prospectus supplement that is inconsistent with information in the accompanying
prospectus will apply and will supersede any inconsistent information in the
accompanying prospectus.

   You should refer to the Indenture, dated as of October 12, 2006, between us
and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, as supplemented by the Fourth
Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 18, 2007, and the Eighth Supplemental
Indenture, dated as of December 3, 2010, and as further supplemented by the
applicable supplemental indenture governing such series of the Notes. The
Indenture, as so supplemented, is referred to as the Indenture in this
prospectus supplement. The Indenture, including these supplemental indentures,
has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement or an exhibit to our
Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 6, 2010, or will be filed as an
exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K relating to this offering. The
following summary, together with the descriptions in the accompanying
prospectus, of certain provisions of the Notes and the Indenture does not
purport to be complete and is subject, and qualified in its entirety by
reference, to all of the provisions of the Notes and the Indenture, including
the definitions of terms therein. See Where You Can Find More Information in
this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus for details on how
you may obtain a copy of the Indenture from us.

   The Notes will be issued as a series of the debt securities under the
Indenture, as described herein and in the accompanying prospectus.

General

   The Notes will be issued in fully registered form without interest coupons
in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof
and will be represented by global Notes (as defined below) registered in the
name of The Depository Trust Company (DTC) or its nominee.

   The Notes will be unsecured obligations of AIG and will rank equally with
all of our other existing and future unsecured indebtedness. See Risk Factors"
"17415","-- The Notes are our unsecured debt and will be effectively subordinated to any"
"17416","secured obligations we may incur. in this prospectus supplement for additional
information on this risk. In addition, the Notes will be structurally
subordinated to all future and existing obligations of our subsidiaries, which
is significant. See Risk Factors -- We and our subsidiaries have significant"
"17417","leverage and debt obligations. Payments on the Notes will depend on receipt of"
"17418","dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries, and the Notes will be"
"17419","structurally subordinated to the existing and future indebtedness of our"
"17420","subsidiaries. in this prospectus supplement for additional information on this
risk.

   The Notes will be issued in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000,000.
We may, without the consent of the holders of the Notes, increase the principal
amount of the Notes by issuing additional notes on the same terms and
conditions (except that the issue price and issue date may vary) and with the
same CUSIP number, ISIN and common code as the Notes being offered by this
prospectus supplement. The Notes being offered by this prospectus supplement
and any additional notes of the same series would rank equally and ratably and
would be treated as a single class for all purposes of the Indenture.

   The Notes will mature on August 15, 2020. Principal of and interest on the
Notes will be payable, and the Notes will be exchangeable and transferable, at
our office or agency in The City of New York, which initially will be the
corporate trust office of the trustee currently located at 101 Barclay Street,
New York, New York 10286. No service charge will be made for any registration
of transfer or exchange of the Notes, except for any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.

                                      S-9

<PAGE>

   The Notes do not provide for any sinking fund or permit holders to require
us to repurchase the Notes.

   For so long as the Notes are in book-entry form, payments of principal and
interest will be made in immediately available funds by wire transfer to DTC or
its nominee. We may issue definitive Notes in the limited circumstances set
forth in -- Book Entry System below.

   Business Day for the purposes of the Notes means each Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday or Friday that is not a day on which banking institutions
in The City of New York are authorized or obligated by law or executive order
to close.

Interest

   The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 3.375% per annum, payable
semi-annually in arrears on each February 15 and August 15, commencing on
February 15, 2014 (long first coupon), to holders of record on the immediately
preceding February 1 and August 1. Interest on the Notes will be computed on
the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. On the maturity
date of the Notes, holders will be entitled to receive 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If any interest
payment date or the maturity date of the Notes falls on a day that is not a
Business Day, we will make the required payment on the next succeeding Business
Day, and no additional interest will accrue in respect of the payment made on
that next succeeding Business Day.

Optional Redemption

   We will have the right to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any
time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

..   100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; and

..   as determined by the quotation agent, the sum of the present values of the
    remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not
    including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date
    of redemption) discounted to the redemption date, on a semi-annual basis
    assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months at the adjusted
    treasury rate, plus 25 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest
    thereon to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

   The definitions of certain terms used in the paragraph above are listed
below.

   Adjusted treasury rate means, with respect to any redemption date, the
rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the
comparable treasury issue, assuming a price for the comparable treasury issue
(expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the comparable
treasury price for such redemption date.

   Comparable treasury issue means the U.S. Treasury security selected by the
quotation agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the
Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in
accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of
corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such
Notes.

   Comparable treasury price means, with respect to any redemption date, the
average of the reference treasury dealer quotations for such redemption date.

   Quotation agent means AIG Markets, Inc. or any other firm appointed by us,
acting as quotation agent. AIG Markets, Inc. is our subsidiary.

                                     S-10

<PAGE>

   Reference treasury dealer means:

..   each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and a
    primary treasury dealer (as defined below) selected by each of U.S. Bancorp
    Investments, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, or the respective
    successor of any of them; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing
    shall cease to be a primary U.S. government securities dealer in the United
    States (a primary treasury dealer), we will substitute therefor another
    primary treasury dealer; and

..   any other primary treasury dealer selected by the quotation agent after
    consultation with us.

   Reference treasury dealer quotations means with respect to each reference
treasury dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the
quotation agent, of the bid and asked prices for the comparable treasury issue
(expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in
writing to the quotation agent by such reference treasury dealer at 3:30 p.m.
on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.

   All calculations made by the quotation agent for the purposes of calculating
the redemption price of the Notes shall be conclusive and binding on the
holders of the Notes, the trustee and us, absent manifest error. See Risk"
"17421","Factors -- There are potential conflicts of interest between investors in the"
"17422","Notes and the quotation agent.

   If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, selection of
the Notes for redemption will be made by the trustee on a pro rata basis, by
lot or by such method as the trustee deems fair and appropriate, provided that
the Notes with a principal amount of $2,000 will not be redeemed in part.

   We will give to DTC a notice of redemption at least 30 days but not more
than 60 days before the redemption date. If any Notes are to be redeemed in
part only, the notice of redemption will state the portion of the principal
amount thereof to be redeemed. A new Note in a principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the holder thereof
upon cancellation of the original Note. Notice by DTC to its participants and
by participants to street name holders of indirect interests in the Notes
will be made according to arrangements among them and may be subject to
statutory or regulatory requirements. The redemption may be conditioned upon
the occurrence of one or more conditions precedent.

   Unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the
redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof
called for redemption. If a redemption date falls on a day that is not a
Business Day, we will make the required payment on the next succeeding Business
Day, and no additional interest will accrue in respect of the payment made on
that next succeeding Business Day.

Limitation on Liens Covenant

   We have made a covenant with respect to the Notes that we will not and will
not permit any Designated Subsidiary (as defined below) to, directly or
indirectly, create, issue, assume, incur or guarantee any indebtedness for
money borrowed (other than non-recourse indebtedness) which is secured by a
mortgage, pledge, lien, security interest or other encumbrance of any nature on
any of the present or future voting stock of a Designated Subsidiary unless the
Notes and, if we so elect, any of our other indebtednesses ranking at least
pari passu with the Notes, are secured equally and ratably with (or prior to)
such other secured indebtedness. For purpose of this covenant, Designated"
"17423","Subsidiary means American Home Assurance Company, National Union Fire
Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa., and any subsidiary the assets of which
exceed 20% of our consolidated assets, to be determined as of the last day of
the most recent calendar quarter ended at least 30 days prior to the date of
such determination and in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles as in effect on the last day of such calendar quarter. As of
June 30, 2013, AIG Life Holdings, Inc., AIG Property Casualty Inc., AIG
Property Casualty U.S., Inc. and AIUH LLC had assets that exceeded 20% of our
consolidated assets.

Description of Debt Securities AIG May Offer -- Special Situations -- Mergers"
"17424","and Similar Transactions in the accompanying prospectus, the Indenture or the

Notes through DTC, or through the accounts that Clearstream Banking, S.A.

   Notes represented by a global Note will be exchangeable for Note
certificates, registered in the names of owners of beneficial interests in the
global Notes, with the same terms and in authorized denominations, only if:

..   the depositary notifies us that it is unwilling, unable or no longer
    permitted under applicable law to continue as depositary for the global
    Notes, and we do not appoint another institution to act as depositary
    within 90 days;

..   we notify the trustee that we wish to terminate that global Note; or

..   an event of default has occurred with regard to the Notes and has not been
    cured or waived.

registered form, in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof. Notes so registered can be transferred by presentation for
registration of transfer to the transfer agent at its corporate trust office
and must be duly endorsed by the holder or his attorney duly authorized in
writing, or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in
form satisfactory to us or the trustee duly executed by the holder or its
attorney duly authorized in writing. We may require payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
with any exchange or registration of transfer of definitive Notes.

   If a global Note is terminated, only DTC, as depositary, and not we or the
trustee, is responsible for deciding the names of the persons in whose names
the Notes delivered in exchange will be registered and, therefore, who will be
the holders of those Notes.

Concerning the Trustee

   The Bank of New York Mellon will initially be the trustee under the
Indenture and also the paying agent and the transfer agent and registrar for
the Notes. We have entered, and from time to time may continue to enter, into
banking or other relationships with The Bank of New York Mellon or its
affiliates. See Description of Debt Securities AIG May Offer -- Our"

Withholdable Payments to Foreign Financial Entities and Other Foreign Entities

   A 30% withholding tax may be imposed on certain payments to you or certain
foreign financial institutions, investment funds and other non-U.S. persons
receiving payments on your behalf if you or such institutions fail to comply
with certain information reporting requirements (FATCA withholding). Such
payments generally will include U.S.-source interest and the gross proceeds
from the sale or other disposition of notes that can produce U.S.-source
interest. Amounts that you receive on the Notes could be subject to this
withholding if you are subject to the information reporting requirements and
fail to comply with them or if you hold Notes through another person (e.g., a
foreign bank or broker) that is subject to withholding because it fails to
comply with these requirements (even if you would not otherwise have been
subject to withholding). However, such payments will only include interest paid
on and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of notes issued or
materially modified on or after July 1, 2014. In addition, withholding will not
apply to payments of gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of Notes
before January 1, 2017. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the
relevant U.S. law and other official guidance on FATCA withholding.

   We will not pay any additional amounts in respect of FATCA withholding, so
if this withholding applies, you will receive significantly less than the
amount that you would have otherwise received with respect to your Notes.
Depending on your circumstances, you may be entitled to a refund or credit in
respect of some or all of this withholding. However, the refund application
process has not yet been finalized, so even if you are entitled to have any
such withholding refunded, the required procedures could be cumbersome.

   The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the underwriters
to purchase the Notes included in this offering are subject to certain
conditions precedent. The underwriters are committed to take and pay for all
the Notes being offered, if any are taken.

   We have been advised by the representatives of the underwriters that the
Notes sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the
price set forth on the cover of this prospectus supplement. Any Notes sold by
the underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount from the
initial public offering price of up to 0.240% of the principal amount of the
Notes. Any such securities dealers may resell any Notes purchased from the
underwriters to certain other brokers or dealers at a discount from the initial
public offering price of up to 0.140% of the principal amount of the Notes.
After the initial offering of the Notes to the public, the underwriters may
from time to time change the public offering price and other selling terms.

   The following table shows the per Note and total underwriting discounts and
commissions to be paid to the underwriters by us. The per Note discount is
expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of the Notes.

   The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market.
We do not intend to list the Notes on any national securities exchange or to
include the Notes in any automated quotation system. We cannot assure you that
the prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after this offering will
not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market
for the Notes will develop and continue after this offering. We have been
advised by the underwriters that the underwriters intend to make a market in
the Notes but are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at
any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the
trading market for the Notes. See Risk Factors -- The trading market for the"
"17429","Notes may be limited and you may be unable to sell your Notes at a price that"
"17430","you deem sufficient. for a further discussion of this risk.

   The underwriters intend to offer the Notes for sale primarily in the United
States either directly or through affiliates or other dealers acting as selling
agents. The underwriters may also offer the Notes for sale outside the United
States either directly or through affiliates or other dealers acting as selling
agents. Standard Chartered Bank will not effect any offers or sales of any
Notes in the United States unless it is through one or more U.S. registered
broker-dealers as permitted by the regulations of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.

   In order to facilitate the offering of the Notes, the underwriters may
engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price
of the Notes. Specifically, the underwriters may over-allot in connection with
the offering, creating a short position in the Notes for their own account. In
addition, to cover over-allotments or to stabilize the price of the Notes, the
underwriters may bid for, and purchase, Notes on the open market. Finally, the
underwriting syndicate may reclaim selling concessions allowed to an
underwriter or a dealer for distributing the Notes in the offering, if the
syndicate repurchases previously distributed Notes in transactions to cover
syndicate short positions, in stabilization transactions or otherwise. Any of
these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the Notes above
independent market levels. The underwriters are not required to engage in these
activities, and may end any of these activities at any time.

   We estimate that total out-of-pocket expenses of this offering payable by
us, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately
$500,000.

   We have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against, and to
contribute toward, certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

   Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have rendered
and may in the future render various investment banking, lending and commercial
banking services and other advisory services to us and our subsidiaries.
Certain of these relationships involve transactions that are material to us and
our affiliates and for which those underwriters received significant fees.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. also acted as a financial advisor to us in
connection with a series of our integrated transactions with the United States
Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the AIG
Credit Facility Trust that closed on January 14, 2011 to recapitalize AIG.
Certain of the underwriters have received, and may in the future receive,
customary compensation from us and our subsidiaries for such services.

   Certain of the underwriters are full service financial institutions engaged
in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and
investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal
investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the
underwriters or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us or
our subsidiaries routinely hedge their credit exposure to us or our
subsidiaries consistent with their customary risk management policies. A
typical hedging strategy would include these underwriters or their affiliates
hedging their exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either
the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our
securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. In the ordinary course of
their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade
debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for
their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time
hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such
investments and securities activities may involve our securities and/or
instruments. The underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect
of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to
clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and
instruments.

   If we choose to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to
repurchase debt securities, we may repurchase debt securities from one or more
of the underwriters or other broker-dealers.

   As previously announced, we have been conducting a review of our dealings
with certain counterparties with which we did securities and related business
before and during the recent financial crisis to determine what

                                     S-16

<PAGE>

legal claims we may have to recover from counterparties that harmed us by their
conduct. These counterparties include a number of financial institutions,
including certain of the underwriters and various of their affiliates. In
connection with this review, we have entered into agreements with a number of
such counterparties, including certain of the joint book-running managers,
tolling the statute of limitations in respect of claims we may have against
those counterparties and, in some cases, that the counterparties may have
against us. In addition, we have entered into settlements with some of these
counterparties, including one of the joint book-running managers, pursuant to
which we had received an aggregate amount of approximately $720 million as of
June 30, 2013.

States where, or in any circumstances in which, action for that purpose is

other offering or publicity material relating to the Notes may not be

Prospectus Directive.

   For the purposes of this provision, the expression an offer to the public
in relation to any Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication

   In any Member State of the EEA that has implemented Directive 2003/71/EC

Directive, as implemented in that Relevant Member State, from the requirement
to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. Accordingly any person making or
intending to make any offer in any Relevant Member State of any Notes may only
do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for AIG or any of the
underwriters to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus
Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus
Directive, in each case, in relation to such offer. None of AIG or the
underwriters has authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of
any Notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for AIG or the
underwriters to publish or supplement a prospectus for such offer.

   Each person in a Relevant Member State who receives any communication in
respect of, or who acquires, any Notes in the offering contemplated in this
prospectus supplement will be deemed to have represented, warranted and agreed
to and with each of the underwriters and AIG that:

Relevant Member State implementing Article 2(1)(e) of the Prospectus Directive;

acquired by it in the offer hereby have not been acquired on behalf of, nor
have they been acquired with a view to their offer or resale to, persons in any
Relevant Member State other than qualified investors, as that term is defined
in the Prospectus Directive, or in circumstances in which the prior consent of
the underwriters has been given to the offer or resale; or (ii) where the Notes
have been acquired by it on behalf of persons in any Relevant Member State
other than qualified investors, the offer of those Notes to it is not treated
under the Prospectus Directive as having been made to such persons.

   For the purposes of this representation, the expression an offer in
relation to any Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in
any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer
and any Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase
or subscribe for the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member
State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant
Member State.

          CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

     This prospectus and other publicly available documents, including the
documents incorporated herein by reference, may include, and AIG's officers and
representatives may from time to time make projections, goals, assumptions and
statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These projections,
goals, assumptions and statements are not historical facts but instead
represent only AIG's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their
nature, are inherently uncertain and outside AIG's control. These projections,
goals, assumptions and statements may address, among other things:

    .   the timing of the disposition of the ownership position of the United
        States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) in AIG;

    .   the cash flow projections and fair value for AIG's interest in Maiden
        Lane III LLC;

        Corporation (ILFC);

        residential and commercial real estate markets, state and municipal
        bond issuers and sovereign bond issuers;

    .   AIG's strategies for customer retention, growth, product development,
        market position, financial results and reserves; and

    .   the revenues and combined ratios of AIG's subsidiaries.

     It is possible that AIG's actual results and financial condition will
differ, possibly materially, from the results and financial condition indicated
in these projections, goals, assumptions and statements. Factors that could
cause AIG's actual results to differ, possibly materially, from those in the
specific projections, goals, assumptions and statements include:

    .   actions by credit rating agencies;

    .   changes in market conditions;

    .   the occurrence of catastrophic events;

                 DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES AIG MAY OFFER

     References to AIG, us, we or our in this section mean American
International Group, Inc. and do not include the subsidiaries of American
International Group, Inc. Also, in this section, references to holders mean
those who own debt securities registered in their own names, on the books that
we or the applicable trustee maintain for this purpose, and not those who own
beneficial interests in debt securities registered in street name or in debt
securities issued in book-entry form through one or more depositaries. When we
refer to you in this prospectus, we mean all purchasers of the securities
being offered by this prospectus, whether they are the holders or only indirect
owners of those securities.

Debt Securities Will Be Senior and Unsecured

     The senior debt securities will not be subordinated to any of our other
obligations or be secured by any of our property or assets or the property or
assets of our subsidiaries. Thus, by owning a debt security, you are one of our
unsecured creditors.

     The senior debt securities will be issued under our senior debt indenture
described below and will rank equally with all of our other unsecured and
unsubordinated debt.

The Senior Debt Indenture

     The senior debt securities are governed by a document called an indenture
-- the senior debt indenture. The senior debt indenture is a contract between
AIG and The Bank of New York Mellon, which acts as trustee.

     The trustee has two main roles:

          1.     The trustee can enforce the rights of holders against us if we
     default on our obligations under the terms of the senior debt indenture or
     the debt securities. There are some limitations on the extent to which the
     trustee acts on behalf of holders, described below under -- Events of"
"17436","     Default -- Remedies If an Event of Default Occurs.

          2.     The trustee performs administrative duties for us, such as
     sending interest payments and notices to holders, and transferring a
     holder's debt securities to a new buyer if a holder sells.

     The senior debt indenture and its associated documents contain the full
legal text of the matters described in this section. The senior debt indenture
and the debt securities are governed by New York law. A copy of the senior debt
indenture is an exhibit to our registration statement. See Where You Can Find"
"17437","More Information above for information on how to obtain a copy.

                                    General

     We may issue as many distinct series of debt securities under the senior
debt indenture as we wish. The provisions of the senior debt indenture allow us
not only to issue debt securities with terms different from those previously
issued but also to reopen a previous issue of a series of debt securities and
issue additional debt securities of that series. We may issue debt securities
in amounts that exceed the total amount specified on the cover of your
prospectus supplement at any time without your consent and without notifying
you.

     This section summarizes the material terms of the debt securities that are
common to all series, although the prospectus supplement which describes the
terms of each series of debt securities may also describe differences from the
material terms summarized here.

     Because this section is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of
the debt securities. This summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety
by reference to all the provisions of the senior debt indenture, including

                                      2

<PAGE>

definitions of certain terms used in the senior debt indenture. In this
summary, we describe the meaning of only some of the more important terms. For
your convenience, we also include references in parentheses to certain sections
of the senior debt indenture. Whenever we refer to particular sections or
defined terms of the senior debt indenture in this prospectus or in the
prospectus supplement, such sections or defined terms are incorporated by
reference here or in the prospectus supplement. You must look to the senior
debt indenture for the most complete description of what we describe in summary
form in this prospectus.

     This summary also is subject to and qualified by reference to the
description of the particular terms of your series of debt securities described
in the prospectus supplement. Those terms may vary from the terms described in
this prospectus. The prospectus supplement relating to each series of debt
securities will be attached to the front of this prospectus. There may also be
a further prospectus supplement, known as a pricing supplement, which contains
the precise terms of debt securities you are offered.

     We may issue the debt securities as original issue discount securities,
which will be offered and sold at a substantial discount below their stated
principal amount. (Section 101) The prospectus supplement relating to any
specific series of debt securities, including original issue discount
securities, may describe certain additional federal income tax considerations,
if any, and any other special considerations applicable to such debt securities.

     In addition, the specific financial, legal and other terms particular to a
series of debt securities will be described in the prospectus supplement and,
if applicable, a pricing supplement relating to the series. The prospectus
supplement relating to a series of debt securities will describe the following
terms of the series:

    .   the title of the series of debt securities;

    .   any limit on the aggregate principal amount of the series of debt
        securities;

    .   the person to whom interest on a debt security is payable, if other
        than the holder on the regular record date;

    .   the date or dates on which the series of debt securities will mature;

    .   the rate or rates, which may be fixed or variable per annum, at which
        the series of debt securities will bear interest, if any, and the date
        or dates from which that interest, if any, will accrue;

    .   the place or places where the principal of and any premium and interest
        on the debt securities is payable;

    .   the dates on which interest, if any, on the series of debt securities
        will be payable and the regular record dates for the interest payment
        dates;

    .   any mandatory or optional sinking funds or similar provisions or
        provisions for redemption at the option of AIG;

    .   the date, if any, after which and the price or prices at which the
        series of debt securities may, in accordance with any optional or
        mandatory redemption provisions, be redeemed and the other detailed
        terms and provisions of those optional or mandatory redemption
        provisions, if any;

    .   if the debt securities may be converted into or exercised or exchanged
        for our common stock or preferred stock or other of our securities or
        the debt or equity securities of third parties, the terms on which
        conversion, exercise or exchange may occur, including whether
        conversion, exercise or exchange is mandatory, at the option of the
        holder or at our option, the period during which conversion, exercise
        or exchange may occur, the initial conversion, exercise or exchange
        price or rate

                                      3

        and the circumstances or manner in which the amount of common stock or
        preferred stock or other securities or the debt or equity securities of
        third parties issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange may be
        adjusted;

    .   if other than denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiples
        thereof, the denominations in which the series of debt securities will
        be issuable;

    .   if other than U.S. dollars, the currency of payment of principal and
        any premium and interest on debt securities of the series;

    .   if the currency of payment for principal and any premium and interest
        on the series of debt securities is subject to our election or that of
        a holder, the currency or currencies in which payment can be made and
        the period within which, and the terms and conditions upon which, the
        election can be made;

    .   any index used to determine the amount of payment of principal or any
        premium or interest on the series of debt securities;

    .   any covenants we make for the benefit of the series of debt securities;

    .   the applicability of the provisions described under -- Defeasance
        below;

    .   any event of default under the series of debt securities if different
        from those described under -- Events of Default below;

        in the form of a global security, the depositary or its nominee with
        respect to the series of debt securities and the circumstances under
        which the global security may be registered for transfer or exchange in
        the name of a person other than the depositary or the nominee; and

    .   any other special feature of the series of debt securities.

     An investment in debt securities linked to an index may involve special
risks. The prospectus supplement or pricing supplement relating to a series of
indexed debt securities will describe the risks relating to such series of debt
securities.

        circumstances, such as how holders transfer ownership and where we make
        payments;

    .   Holders' rights in several Special Situations, such as if we merge with
        another company or if we want to change a term of the debt securities;

    .   Our right to release ourselves from all or some of our obligations
        under the debt securities and the senior debt indenture by a process
        called Defeasance; and

    .   Holders' rights if we Default or experience other financial
        difficulties.

     Any covenants that apply to any series of the debt securities will be
described in an applicable prospectus supplement.

                             Additional Mechanics

Form, Exchange and Transfer

     Unless we specify otherwise in the prospectus supplement, the debt
securities will be issued:

    .   only in fully registered form;

    .   without interest coupons; and

    .   in denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof. (Section 302)

     If a debt security is issued as a registered global debt security, only
the depositary named in your prospectus supplement will be entitled to transfer
and exchange the debt security as described in this subsection, since the
depositary will be the sole holder of the debt security. Those who own
beneficial interests in a global security do so through participants in the
depositary's securities clearance system, and the rights of these indirect
owners will be governed solely by the applicable procedures of the depositary
and its participants. We describe book-entry procedures and the special
provisions that apply to a registered global debt security, the depositary and
its participants under Legal Ownership and Book-Entry Issuance.

     Holders may have their debt securities broken into more debt securities of
smaller denominations of not less than $1,000 (or such integral multiple of
$1,000 as may be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement) or combined
into fewer debt securities of larger denominations, as long as the total
principal amount is not changed. (Section 305) This is called an exchange.

     Holders may exchange or transfer debt securities at the office of the
trustee. They may also replace lost, stolen or mutilated debt securities at
that office. The trustee acts as our agent for registering debt securities in
the names of holders and transferring debt securities. We may change this
appointment to another entity or perform it ourselves. The entity performing
the role of maintaining the list of registered holders is called the security
registrar. It will also perform transfers. (Section 305) The trustee may
require an indemnity before replacing any debt securities.

     Holders will not be required to pay a service charge to transfer or
exchange debt securities, but holders may be required to pay for any tax or
other governmental charge associated with the exchange or transfer. The
transfer or exchange will only be made if the security registrar is satisfied
with your proof of ownership.

     If we designate additional transfer agents, they will be named in the
prospectus supplement. We may cancel the designation of any particular transfer
agent. We may also approve a change in the office through which any transfer
agent acts. (Section 1002)

     If the debt securities are redeemable and we redeem less than all of the
debt securities of a particular series, we may block the transfer or exchange
of debt securities during the period beginning 15 days before the day we mail
the notice of redemption and ending on the day of that mailing, in order to
freeze the list of holders to prepare the mailing. We may also refuse to
register transfers or exchanges of debt securities selected for redemption,
except that we will continue to permit transfers and exchanges of the
unredeemed portion of any debt security being partially redeemed. (Section 305)

     The rules for exchange described above apply to exchange of debt
securities for other debt securities of the same series and kind. If a debt
security is convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into or for a different
kind of security, such as one that we have not issued, or for other property,
the rules governing that type of conversion, exercise or exchange will be
described in the prospectus supplement.

                                      5

Payment and Paying Agents

     We will pay interest to the person listed in the trustee's records at the
close of business on a particular day in advance of each due date for interest,
even if that person no longer owns the debt security on the interest due date.
That particular day, usually approximately fifteen days in advance of the
interest due date, is called the regular record date and will be stated in the
prospectus supplement. (Section 307) Holders buying and selling debt securities
should take into consideration the fact that we will pay all the interest for
an interest period to the registered holder as of the regular record date.
Holders commonly adjust the sale price of the securities to pro rate interest
fairly between buyer and seller. This prorated interest amount is called
accrued interest.

     We will pay interest, principal and any other money due on the debt
securities at our office or agency in The City of New York, which initially
will be the corporate trust office of the trustee currently located at 101
Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286. Holders must make arrangements to
have their payments picked up at or wired from that office. We may also choose
to pay interest by mailing checks.

BOOK-ENTRY AND OTHER INDIRECT HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR BANKS, BROKERS OR
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THEY WILL RECEIVE PAYMENTS.

     We may also arrange for additional payment offices and may cancel or
change these offices, including our use of the trustee's corporate trust
office. These offices are called paying agents. We may also choose to act as
our own paying agent or choose one of our subsidiaries to do so. We must notify
the trustee of changes in the paying agents for any particular series of debt
securities. (Section 1002)

Notices

     We and the trustee will send notices regarding the debt securities only to
holders, using their addresses as listed in the trustee's records. (Sections
101 and 106) We discuss legal ownership of debt securities held in book-entry
form below under Legal Ownership and Book-Entry Issuance.

     Regardless of who acts as paying agent, all money paid by us to a paying
agent that remains unclaimed at the end of two years after the amount is due to
holders will be repaid to us. After that two-year period, holders may look to
us for payment and not to the trustee or any other paying agent. (Section 1003)

                              Special Situations

Mergers and Similar Transactions

     We are generally permitted to consolidate or merge with another company or
firm. We are also permitted to sell or lease our properties and assets
substantially as an entirety to another company or firm. However, we may not
take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met:

    .   When we merge or consolidate out of existence or sell or lease our
        properties and assets substantially as an entirety, the other company
        or firm may not be organized under a foreign country's laws -- that is,
        it must be a corporation, partnership or trust organized under the laws
        of a state of the United States or the District of Columbia or under
        federal law -- and it must agree to be legally responsible for the debt
        securities.

    .   The merger, sale of assets or other transaction must not cause a
        default on the debt securities, and we must not already be in default
        (unless the merger or other transaction would cure the default). For
        purposes of this no-default test, a default would include an event of
        default that has occurred and not been cured. A default for this
        purpose would also include any event that would be an event of default
        if the requirements for giving us default notice or our default having
        to exist for a specific period of time were disregarded. (Section 801)

                                      6

<PAGE>

     If the conditions described above are satisfied with respect to any series
of debt securities, we will not need to obtain the approval of the holders of
those debt securities in order to merge or consolidate or to sell our assets.
Also, these conditions will apply only if we wish to merge or consolidate with
another entity or sell our properties and assets substantially as an entirety
to another entity. We will not need to satisfy these conditions if we enter
into other types of transactions, including any transaction in which we acquire
the stock or assets of another entity, any transaction that involves a change
of control but in which we do not merge or consolidate and any transaction in
which we do not sell our properties and assets substantially as an entirety. It
is possible that this type of transaction may result in a reduction in our
credit rating, may reduce our operating results or may impair our financial
condition. Holders of our debt securities, however, will have no approval right
with respect to any transaction of this type.

Modification and Waiver of the Debt Securities

     There are four types of changes we can make to the senior debt indenture
and the debt securities.

     Changes Requiring Approval of All Holders.  First, there are changes that
cannot be made to the senior debt indenture or the debt securities without
specific approval of each holder of a debt security affected in any material
respect by the change under the indenture. Affected debt securities may be all
or less than all of the debt securities issued under the senior debt indenture
or all or less than all of the debt securities of a series. Following is a list
of those types of changes:

    .   change the stated maturity of the principal or interest on a debt
        security;

    .   reduce any amounts due on a debt security;

    .   reduce the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the
        maturity of a debt security (including the amount payable on an
        original issue discount debt security) following a default;

    .   change the place or currency of payment on a debt security;

    .   impair a holder's right to sue for payment;

    .   reduce the percentage of holders of debt securities whose consent is
        needed to modify or amend the senior debt indenture;

    .   reduce the percentage of holders of debt securities whose consent is
        needed to waive compliance with certain provisions of the senior debt
        indenture or to waive certain defaults; or

    .   modify any other aspect of the provisions dealing with modification and
        waiver of the senior debt indenture. (Section 902)

     Changes Requiring a Majority Vote.  The second type of change to the
senior debt indenture and the debt securities is the kind that requires a vote
in favor by holders of debt securities owning not less than a majority of the
principal amount of the particular series affected or, if so provided and to
the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the Trust"
"17438","Indenture Act), of particular debt securities affected thereby. Most changes
fall into this category, except for clarifying changes and certain other
changes that would not adversely affect in any material respect holders of the
debt securities. (Section 901) We may also obtain a waiver of a past default
from the holders of debt securities owning a majority of the principal amount
of the particular series affected. However, we cannot obtain a waiver of a
payment default or any other aspect of the senior debt indenture or the debt
securities listed in the first category described above under -- Changes"
"17439","Requiring Approval of All Holders unless we obtain the individual consent of
each holder to the waiver. (Section 513)

                                      7

<PAGE>

     Changes Not Requiring Approval.  The third type of change to the senior
debt indenture and the debt securities does not require any vote by holders of
debt securities. This type is limited to clarifications and certain other
changes that would not adversely affect in any material respect holders of the
debt securities. (Section 901)

     We may also make changes or obtain waivers that do not adversely affect in
any material respect a particular debt security, even if they affect other debt
securities. In those cases, we do not need to obtain the approval of the holder
of that debt security; we need only obtain any required approvals from the
holders of the affected debt securities.

     Further Details Concerning Voting.  When taking a vote, we will use the
following rules to decide how much principal amount to attribute to a debt
security:

    .   For original issue discount securities, we will use the principal
        amount that would be due and payable on the voting date if the maturity
        of the debt securities were accelerated to that date because of a
        default.

    .   For debt securities whose principal amount is not known (for example,
        because they are based on an index), we will use a special rule for
        that debt security described in the prospectus supplement.

    .   For debt securities denominated in one or more foreign currencies or
        currency units, we will use the U.S. dollar equivalent.

    .   Debt securities owned by us or any other obligor upon the debt
        securities or any of our affiliates or such other obligor's affiliates
        will be disregarded.

     Debt securities will not be considered outstanding, and therefore not
eligible to vote, if we have given a notice of redemption and deposited or set
aside in trust for the holders money for the payment or redemption of the debt
securities. Debt securities will also not be eligible to vote if they have been
fully defeased as described below under -- Defeasance -- Full Defeasance.
(Section 1302)

     We will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the
purpose of determining the holders of outstanding debt securities that are
entitled to vote or take other action under the senior debt indenture. In
certain limited circumstances, the trustee will be entitled to set a record
date for action by holders. If we or the trustee set a record date for a vote
or other action to be taken by holders of a particular series of debt
securities that vote or action may be taken only by persons who are holders of
outstanding debt securities of that series on the record date. We or the
trustee, as applicable, may shorten or lengthen the period during which holders
may take action. (Section 104)

BOOK-ENTRY AND OTHER INDIRECT HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR BANKS, BROKERS OR
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR INFORMATION ON HOW APPROVAL MAY BE GRANTED OR
DENIED IF WE SEEK TO CHANGE THE SENIOR DEBT INDENTURE OR THE DEBT SECURITIES OR
REQUEST A WAIVER.

                                  Defeasance

     The following discussion of full defeasance and covenant defeasance will
be applicable to each series of debt securities that is denominated in U.S.
dollars and has a fixed rate of interest and will apply to other series of debt
securities if we so specify in the prospectus supplement. (Section 1301)

                                      8

<PAGE>

Full Defeasance

     If there is a change in U.S. federal tax law, as described below, we can
legally release ourselves from any payment or other obligations on the debt
securities, called full defeasance, if we put in place the following other
arrangements for holders to be repaid:

    .   We must deposit in trust for the benefit of all holders of the debt
        securities a combination of money and notes or bonds of the U.S.
        government or a U.S. government agency or U.S. government-sponsored
        entity (the obligations of which are backed by the full faith and
        credit of the U.S. government) that will generate enough cash to make
        interest, principal and any other payments on the debt securities on
        their various due dates.

    .   There must be a change in current U.S. federal tax law or an IRS ruling
        that lets us make the above deposit without causing the holders to be
        taxed on the debt securities any differently than if we did not make
        the deposit and just repaid the debt securities ourselves. (Under
        current federal tax law, the deposit and our legal release from the
        obligations pursuant to the debt securities would be treated as though
        we took back your debt securities and gave you your share of the cash
        and notes or bonds deposited in trust. In that event, you could
        recognize gain or loss on the debt securities you give back to us.)

    .   We must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel
        confirming the tax law change described above. (Sections 1302 and 1304)

     If we ever did accomplish full defeasance, as described above, you would
have to rely solely on the trust deposit for repayment on the debt securities.
You could not look to us for repayment in the unlikely event of any shortfall.

Covenant Defeasance

     Under current U.S. federal tax law, we can make the same type of deposit
as described above and we will be released from the restrictive covenants under
the debt securities that may be described in the prospectus supplement. This is
called covenant defeasance. In that event, you would lose the protection of
these covenants but would gain the protection of having money and U.S.
government or U.S. government agency notes or bonds set aside in trust to repay
the debt securities. In order to achieve covenant defeasance, we must do the
following:

    .   Deposit in trust for the benefit of all holders of the debt securities
        a combination of money and notes or bonds of the U.S. government or a
        U.S. government agency or U.S. government sponsored entity (the
        obligations of which are backed by the full faith and credit of the
        U.S. government) that will generate enough cash to make interest,
        principal and any other payments on the debt securities on their
        various due dates.

    .   Deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel confirming that
        under current U.S. federal income tax law we may make the above deposit
        without causing the holders to be taxed on the debt securities any
        differently than if we did not make the deposit and just repaid the
        debt securities ourselves.

     If we accomplish covenant defeasance, certain provisions of the senior
debt indenture and the debt securities would no longer apply:

    .   Covenants applicable to the series of debt securities and described in
        the prospectus supplement.

    .   Any events of default relating to breach of those covenants.

                                      9

<PAGE>

     If we accomplish covenant defeasance, you can still look to us for
repayment of the debt securities if there were a shortfall in the trust
deposit. In fact, if one of the remaining events of default occurred (such as a
bankruptcy) and the debt securities become immediately due and payable, there
may be such a shortfall. (Sections 1303 and 1304)

                               Events of Default

     You will have special rights if an event of default occurs and is not
cured, as described later in this subsection.

     What Is An Event of Default? The term Event of Default means any of the
following:

    .   We do not pay the principal of or any premium on a debt security within
        5 days of its due date.

    .   We do not pay interest on a debt security within 30 days of its due
        date.

    .   We do not deposit money in a separate account, known as a sinking fund,
        within 5 days of its due date.

    .   We remain in breach of any covenant or warranty of the senior debt
        indenture for 60 days after we receive a notice of default stating we
        are in breach. The notice must be sent by either the trustee or holders
        of 25% of the principal amount of debt securities of the affected
        series.

    .   We file for bankruptcy or certain other events of bankruptcy,
        insolvency or reorganization occur.

    .   Any other event of default described in the prospectus supplement
        occurs. (Section 501)

     Remedies If an Event of Default Occurs.  If an event of default occurs,
the trustee will have special duties. In that situation, the trustee will be
obligated to use those of its rights and powers under the senior debt
indenture, and to use the same degree of care and skill in doing so, that a
prudent person would use in that situation in conducting his or her own
affairs. If an event of default has occurred and has not been cured, the
trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the debt
securities of the affected series may declare the entire principal amount (or,
in the case of original issue discount securities, the portion of the principal
amount that is specified in the terms of the affected debt security) of all the
debt securities of that series to be due and immediately payable. This is
called a declaration of acceleration of maturity. However, a declaration of
acceleration of maturity may be cancelled, but only before a judgment or decree
based on the acceleration has been obtained, by the holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the debt securities of the affected series,
provided that all other defaults have been cured and all payment obligations
have been made current. (Section 502)

     You should read carefully the prospectus supplement relating to any series
of debt securities which are original issue discount securities for the
particular provisions relating to acceleration of the maturity of a portion of
the principal amount of original issue discount securities upon the occurrence
of an event of default and its continuation.

     Except in cases of default, where the trustee has the special duties
described above, the trustee is not required to take any action under the
senior debt indenture at the request of any holders unless the holders offer
the trustee reasonable protection from expenses and liability called an
indemnity. (Section 603) If indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the trustee is
provided, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
securities of the relevant series may direct the time, method and place of
conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy
available to the trustee. These majority holders may also direct the trustee in
performing any other action under the senior debt indenture with respect to the
debt securities of that series. (Section 512)

                                      10

<PAGE>

     Before you bypass the trustee and bring your own lawsuit or other formal
legal action or take other steps to enforce your rights or protect your
interests relating to the debt securities the following must occur:

    .   The holder of the debt security must give the trustee written notice
        that an event of default has occurred and remains uncured;

    .   The holders of 25% in principal amount of all outstanding securities of
        the relevant series must make a written request that the trustee take
        action because of the default, and they must offer reasonable indemnity
        to the trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities of taking
        that action; and

    .   The trustee must have not taken action for 60 days after receipt of the
        above notice and offer of indemnity. (Section 507)

     However, you are entitled at any time to bring a lawsuit for the payment
of money due on your debt security on or after its due date. (Section 508)

BOOK-ENTRY AND OTHER INDIRECT HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR BANKS, BROKERS OR
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR INFORMATION ON HOW TO GIVE NOTICE OR DIRECTION
TO OR MAKE A REQUEST OF THE TRUSTEE AND TO MAKE OR CANCEL A DECLARATION OF
ACCELERATION.

     We will give to the trustee every year a written statement of certain of
our officers certifying that to their best knowledge we are in compliance with
the senior debt indenture and the debt securities, or else specifying any
default. (Section 1004)

                       Our Relationship with the Trustee

     The Bank of New York Mellon is one of our lenders and from time to time
provides other banking services to us and our subsidiaries.

     The Bank of New York Mellon serves as the trustee for our debt securities
and our subordinated debt securities. Consequently, if an actual or potential
event of default occurs with respect to either the debt securities offered by
this prospectus or any series of subordinated debt securities, the trustee may
be considered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the Trust
Indenture Act. In that case, the trustee may be required to resign under one or
more of the indentures and we would be required to appoint a successor trustee.
For this purpose, a potential event of default means an event that would be
an event of default if the requirements for giving us default notice or for the
default having to exist for a specific period of time were disregarded.

                          DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK

     References to AIG, us, we or our in this section mean American
International Group, Inc. and do not include the subsidiaries of American
International Group, Inc. Also, in this section, references to holders mean
those who own common stock registered in their own names, on the books that we
maintain for this purpose. When we refer to you in this section, we mean
those who invest in the securities being offered by this prospectus.

                                    General

     AIG's authorized capital stock includes 5,000,000,000 shares of common
stock (par value $2.50 per share). As of May 31, 2012, there were 1,728,456,852
shares of common stock outstanding.

     All of the outstanding shares of our common stock are fully paid and
nonassessable. Subject to the prior rights of the holders of shares of
preferred stock that may be issued and outstanding, the holders of common stock
are entitled:

    .   to receive dividends when, as and if declared by our board of directors
        out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends; and

    .   in the event of dissolution of AIG, to share ratably in all assets
        remaining after payment of liabilities and satisfaction of the
        liquidation preferences, if any, of then outstanding shares of
        preferred stock, as provided in AIG's restated certificate of
        incorporation.

     Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held of
record on all matters presented to a vote at a shareholders meeting, including
the election of directors. Holders of common stock have no cumulative voting
rights or preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for any additional shares
of common stock or other securities, and there are no conversion rights or
redemption or sinking fund provisions with respect to the common stock.
Authorized but unissued shares of common stock may be issued without
shareholder approval.

     AIG has adopted direct company registration of its common stock. Holders
of shares of common stock will not receive stock certificates evidencing their
share ownership. Instead, they will be provided with a statement reflecting the
number of shares registered in their accounts.

     The transfer agent for our common stock is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.

                             Protective Amendment

     Our board of directors and our shareholders approved an amendment to our
previous amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which amendment has
been included in our current restated certificate of incorporation (such
amendment, the Protective Amendment). The purpose of the Protective Amendment
is to prevent certain transfers of our securities that could result in an
ownership change under Section 382 (Section 382) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and, therefore, materially inhibit our
ability to use certain net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss
carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards to reduce future income
taxes (the Tax Attributes).

     The Protective Amendment generally restricts any direct or indirect
transfer of our common stock (such as transfers of our securities that result
from the transfer of interests in other entities that own our common stock) if
the effect would be to:

    .   increase the direct, indirect or constructive ownership by any Person
        (as defined below) to 4.99 percent or more of our common stock then
        outstanding or certain other classes of stock then outstanding (a Five"
"17440","        Percent Shareholder); or

    .   increase the percentage of our stock owned directly, indirectly or
        constructively by a Five Percent Shareholder.

                                      12

     Person means any individual, firm, partnership, limited liability
company, trust, association, limited liability partnership, corporation or
other entity within the meaning of Treasury Regulation (S)1.382-3(a)(1)(i),
and includes any successor (by merger or otherwise) of such entity. Restricted
transfers include sales to Persons whose resulting percentage ownership
(direct, indirect or constructive) of our common stock would equal or exceed
the 4.99 percent threshold discussed above, or to Persons whose direct or
indirect ownership of our common stock would by attribution cause another
Person to equal or exceed such threshold. Complicated stock ownership rules
prescribed by the Code (and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder) apply
in determining whether a Person is a Five Percent Shareholder under the
Protective Amendment.

     These transfer restrictions may result in the delay or refusal of certain
requested transfers of our common stock, or prohibit ownership (thus requiring
dispositions) of our common stock due to a change in the relationship between
two or more persons or entities or to a transfer of an interest in an entity
that, directly or indirectly, owns our common stock. The transfer restrictions
will also apply to proscribe the creation or transfer of certain options
(which are broadly defined by Section 382) with respect to AIG securities to
the extent that, in certain circumstances, the creation, transfer or exercise
of the option would result in a proscribed level of ownership.

     Any direct or indirect transfer attempted in violation of the Protective
Amendment will be void as of the date of the prohibited transfer as to the
purported transferee (or, in the case of an indirect transfer, the direct owner
of our securities will be deemed to have disposed of, and required to dispose,
the excess stock (as defined below), with such disposition being deemed to
occur simultaneously with the transfer), and the purported transferee (or in
the case of any indirect transfer, the direct owner) will not be recognized as
the owner of the securities owned in violation of the Protective Amendment for
any purpose, including for purposes of voting and receiving dividends or other
distributions in respect of our common stock, or in the case of options,
receiving our common stock in respect of their exercise. In this prospectus,
the common stock purportedly acquired in violation of the Protective Amendment
is referred to as excess stock.

     In addition to a prohibited transfer being void as of the date it is
attempted, upon demand, the purported transferee must transfer the excess stock
to our agent along with any dividends or other distributions paid with respect
to such excess stock. Our agent is required to sell such excess stock in an
arm's-length transaction (or series of transactions) that would not constitute
a violation under the Protective Amendment. The net proceeds of the sale,
together with any other distributions with respect to such excess stock
received by our agent, after deduction of all costs incurred by the agent, will
be distributed first to the purported transferee in an amount, if any, up to
the cost (or, in the case of gift, inheritance or similar transfer, the fair
market value of the excess stock on the date of the prohibited transfer)
incurred by the purported transferee to acquire such excess stock, and the
balance of the proceeds, if any, will be distributed to the transferor in the
prohibited transfer, or to a charitable beneficiary if the transferor cannot be
readily identified. If the excess stock is sold by the purported transferee,
such person will be treated as having sold the excess stock on behalf of our
agent, and will be required to remit all proceeds to our agent (except to the
extent we grant written permission to the purported transferee to retain an
amount, not to exceed the amount such person otherwise would have been entitled
to retain had our agent sold such shares for an amount equal to the proceeds of
such sale (taking into account the actual costs incurred by our agent)).

     The transfer restrictions in the Protective Amendment are subject to
certain exceptions. Among other things, a transfer from one member of a public"
"17441","group (as defined under Section 382) to another member of the same public
group that does not result in such transferee being treated as a 5-percent"
"17442","shareholder (as defined under Section 382) does not increase the percentage
interests taken into account for purposes of determining an ownership change
and, therefore, such transfers are generally not restricted. In addition, our
board of directors will have the discretion to approve a transfer of our
securities that would otherwise violate the transfer restrictions if it
determines that the transfer is in our best interests or if the board of
directors receives a report, at the board of directors' request, from our
advisors that the proposed transfer does not create a significant risk of
material adverse tax consequences to us. The board of directors is also
required to approve any proposed transfer

                                      13

<PAGE>

by Treasury if that transfer and all prior and anticipated transfers or other
transactions during the relevant testing period do not result in an owner"
"17443","shift of more than 40 percent under Section 382.

     The Protective Amendment expires on the earliest of (i) the close of
business on the third anniversary of the annual meeting of our shareholders in
2011, (ii) the date on which our board of directors receives, at its request, a
report from our advisors that the Protective Amendment is no longer necessary
for the preservation of the Tax Attributes because of the amendment or repeal
of Section 382 or any other change in law, (iii) the first day of a taxable
year to which our board of directors receives a report, at its request, from
our advisors that no Tax Attributes may be carried forward, and (iv) such date
as the board of directors determines for the restrictions in the Protective
Amendment to terminate.

                         The Tax Asset Protection Plan

     Our board of directors adopted our Tax Asset Protection Plan (the Tax"
"17444","Asset Protection Plan) on March 9, 2011 and our shareholders ratified the Tax
Asset Protection Plan at our annual meeting of shareholders on May 11, 2011.
Subject to certain limited exceptions, the Tax Asset Protection Plan is
intended to act as a deterrent to any person or group acquiring 4.99 percent or
more of our outstanding common stock (an Acquiring Person) without the
approval of our board of directors. Shareholders who owned 4.99 percent or more
of our common stock as of the close of business on March 9, 2011 generally will
not trigger the Tax Asset Protection Plan so long as they do not acquire any
additional shares of our common stock. Treasury is the only shareholder who
owned 4.99 percent or more of our common stock as of the close of business on
March 9, 2011. Our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, exempt any
person or group from being deemed an Acquiring Person for purposes of the Tax
Asset Protection Plan with respect to which it receives, at its request, a
report from our advisors to the effect that such exemption would not create a
significant risk of material adverse tax consequences to us, or our board of
directors otherwise determines it is in our best interests.

     The Rights.  Our board of directors authorized the issuance of one right
per each outstanding share of our common stock payable to our shareholders of
record as of the close of business on March 18, 2011. Subject to the terms,
provisions and conditions of the Tax Asset Protection Plan, if these rights
become exercisable, each right would initially represent the right to purchase
from us one ten-thousandth of a share of our Participating Preferred Stock, par
value $5.00 per share (the Participating Preferred Stock), for a purchase
price of $185.00 per right (the Exercise Price). If issued, each one
ten-thousandth of a share of Participating Preferred Stock would generally give
a shareholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as
does one share of our common stock. However, prior to exercise, a right does
not give its holder any rights as a shareholder, including without limitation
any dividend, voting or liquidation rights.

     Exercisability.  The rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of
(i) a public announcement by us that a person or group has become an Acquiring
Person (the date of such public announcement is referred to herein as the
Stock Acquisition Date) and (ii) 10 business days after the commencement of a
tender or exchange offer by a person or group if upon consummation of the offer
the person or group would directly, indirectly or constructively own 4.99
percent or more of our outstanding common stock. We refer to the date on which
the rights become exercisable as the Separation Time.

     Until the Separation Time, our common stock certificates (or the
registration of uncertificated shares on our stock transfer books) will
evidence the rights and may contain a notation to that effect. Any transfer of
shares of our common stock prior to the Separation Time will constitute a
transfer of the associated rights. After the Separation Time, the rights may be
transferred other than in connection with the transfer of the underlying shares
of our common stock.

     If there is an Acquiring Person on the Separation Time or a person or
group becomes an Acquiring Person after the Separation Time, each holder of a
right, other than rights that are or were beneficially owned by an Acquiring
Person (which will be void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon
exercise of a right and

                                      14

<PAGE>

payment of the Exercise Price that number of shares of our common stock (or, at
AIG's election, Participating Preferred Stock) having a market value of two
times the exercise price of the right.

     Exchange.  At any time after the Stock Acquisition Date, provided the
Acquiring Person does not hold 50 percent or more of the outstanding common
stock, our board of directors may exchange the rights, other than rights that
are or were beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person (which will be void) in
whole or in part, at an exchange ratio equal to one share of our common stock
(or one ten-thousandth of a share of Participating Preferred Stock) per right.

     Redemption.  At any time until the Stock Acquisition Date, the board of
directors may redeem all of the then-outstanding rights in whole, but not in
part, at a price of $0.001 per right, subject to adjustment (the Redemption"
"17445","Price). Immediately upon action of the board of directors ordering redemption
of the rights, the right to exercise the rights will terminate, and the only
right of the holders of rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.

     Anti-Dilution Provisions.  The Exercise Price and the number of
outstanding rights are subject to adjustment to prevent dilution that may occur
as a result of certain events, including, among others, a stock dividend, a
stock split or a reclassification of our common stock.

     Amendments.  Any of the provisions of the Tax Asset Protection Plan may be
amended by our board of directors at any time and in any manner.

     Expiration.  The rights issued pursuant to the Tax Asset Protection Plan
will expire on the earliest of (i) the close of business on March 9, 2014,
provided that the board of directors may determine to extend the Tax Asset
Protection Plan prior to such date as long as our shareholders are asked to
ratify such extension at the next succeeding annual meeting, (ii) the time at
which the rights are redeemed, (iii) the time at which the rights are
exchanged, (iv) the time at which our board of directors receives, at its
request, a report from our advisors that the Tax Attributes are utilized in all
material respects or no longer available in any material aspect or that an
ownership change under Section 382 or any applicable state law would not
adversely impact in any material respect the time period in which we could use
the Tax Attributes, or materially impair the amount of the Tax Attributes that
could be used.

      DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK AND DEPOSITARY SHARES AIG MAY OFFER

     References to AIG, us, we or our in this section mean American
International Group, Inc. and do not include the subsidiaries of American
International Group, Inc. Also, in this section, references to holders mean
those who own shares of preferred stock or depositary shares, as the case may
be, registered in their own names, on the books that we maintain or, in the
case of the depositary shares, the depositary maintains for this purpose. When
we refer to you in this section, we mean those who invest in the securities
being offered by this prospectus.

     We may issue preferred stock in one or more series. We may also reopen a
previously issued series of preferred stock and issue additional preferred
stock of that series. This section summarizes terms of the preferred stock that
apply generally to all series. The description of most of the financial and
other specific terms of your series will be in your prospectus supplement.
Those terms may vary from the terms described here.

     Our authorized capital stock includes 100,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $5.00 per share. The preferred stock will be governed by
Delaware law. The prospectus supplement with respect to any offered preferred
stock will include a description of the preferred stock that may be outstanding
as of the date of the prospectus supplement.

     The authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock are available for
issuance from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors without
shareholder approval. Our board of directors is authorized to divide the
preferred stock into series and, with respect to each series, to determine the
designations, the powers, preferences and rights and the qualifications,
limitations and restrictions of the series, including:

    .   dividend rights;

    .   conversion or exchange rights;

    .   voting rights;

    .   redemption rights and terms;

    .   liquidation preferences;

    .   sinking fund provisions;

    .   the serial designation of the series; and

    .   the number of shares constituting the series.

     In addition, as described below under -- Fractional or Multiple Shares of"
"17446","Preferred Stock Issued as Depositary Shares, we may, at our option, instead of
offering whole individual shares of any series of preferred stock, offer
depositary shares evidenced by depositary receipts. The rights of holders of
preferred stock may be adversely affected by the rights of holders of existing
preferred stock or preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Our board
of directors may cause shares of preferred stock to be issued in public or
private transactions for any proper corporate purpose.

     Preferred stock will be fully paid and nonassessable when issued, which
means that our holders will have paid their purchase price in full and that we
may not ask them to surrender additional funds. Unless otherwise provided in
your prospectus supplement, holders of preferred stock will not have preemptive
or subscription rights to acquire more stock of AIG.

                                      16

<PAGE>

     All preferred stock will be issued in direct company registration form on
the books and records of AIG. Purchasers of shares of preferred stock will be
provided with a statement reflecting the number of shares registered in their
accounts.

     The prospectus supplement relating to any specific series of preferred
stock may describe certain additional federal income tax considerations, if
any, and any other special considerations applicable to such preferred stock.

Fractional or Multiple Shares of Preferred Stock Issued as Depositary Shares

     If we issue depositary shares evidenced by depositary receipts instead of
issuing whole individual shares of any series of preferred stock, each
depositary share shall represent a fraction of a share or some multiple of
shares of the particular series of preferred stock issued and deposited with a
depositary. The fraction of a share or multiple of shares of preferred stock
which each depositary share represents will be stated in the prospectus
supplement relating to any series of preferred stock offered through depositary
shares.

     We will deposit the shares of preferred stock to be represented by
depositary shares under a deposit agreement. The parties to the deposit
agreement will be AIG, a bank or other financial institutional selected by us
and named in the prospectus supplement, as preferred stock depositary, and the
holders from time to time of depositary receipts issued under that deposit
agreement. Under each deposit agreement, only the name of the person in whose
name the depositary shares are registered on the records of the depositary is
recognized as the holder of that security.

     Each holder of a depositary share will be entitled to all the rights and
preferences of the underlying preferred stock, including, where applicable,
dividend, voting, redemption, conversion and liquidation rights, in proportion
to the applicable fraction or multiple of a share of preferred stock
represented by the depositary share. The depositary shares will be evidenced by
depositary receipts issued under the deposit agreement. The depositary receipts
will be distributed to those persons purchasing the fractional or multiple
shares of preferred stock. A depositary receipt may evidence any number of
whole depositary shares.

     We will file the deposit agreement, including the form of depositary
receipt, with the SEC, either as an exhibit to an amendment to the registration
statement of which this prospectus forms a part or as an exhibit to a current
report on Form 8-K. See Where You Can Find More Information above for
information on how to obtain a copy of the form of deposit agreement.

     We will deliver all required reports and communications to holders of the
preferred stock to the preferred stock depositary, who will forward those
reports and communications to the holders of depositary shares.

          CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO NON-U.S. DOLLAR DEBT SECURITIES

     This prospectus and any attached prospectus supplement (including any
pricing supplement) do not describe all the risks of an investment in debt
securities denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars. You should
consult your own financial and legal advisors about the risks of an investment
in debt securities denominated in a currency, including any composite currency,
other than U.S. dollars. If you are unsophisticated with respect to foreign
currency transactions, these debt securities are not an appropriate investment
for you.

The information set forth in this prospectus is applicable to you only if you
are a U.S. resident. We disclaim any responsibility to advise prospective
purchasers who are residents of countries other than the United States with
respect to any matters that may affect the purchase, holding or receipt of
payments on the debt securities. If you are not a U.S. resident, you should
consult your own financial and legal advisors with regard to such matters.

Information About Exchange Rates May Not Be Indicative of Future Performance

     With respect to any debt security denominated in a currency other than
U.S. dollars, the applicable pricing supplement may include a currency
supplement on the applicable specified currency. A currency supplement may
include historical exchange rates for the specified currency. Information
concerning exchange rates is furnished as a matter of information only. You
should not regard such information as indicative of the range of or trends in
fluctuations in currency exchange rates that may occur in the future.

An Investment in a Non-U.S. Dollar Debt Security Involves Currency-Related Risks

     If you invest in debt securities that are denominated in a currency other
than U.S. dollars, your investment may be subject to significant risks that are
not associated with a similar investment in a debt security denominated in U.S.
dollars. These risks include, for example, the possibility of significant
changes in rates of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the various foreign
currencies or composite currencies and the possibility of the imposition or
modification of foreign exchange controls by either the U.S. or foreign
governments. These risks depend on events over which we have no control, such
as economic and political events and the supply of and demand for the relevant
currencies.

Changes in Currency Exchange Rates Can Be Volatile and Unpredictable

     In recent years, rates of exchange between the U.S. dollar and many other
currencies have been highly volatile, and this volatility may be expected to
continue and perhaps spread to other currencies in the future. Fluctuations in
currency exchange rates could adversely affect an investment in a debt security
with a specified currency other than U.S. dollars. Depreciation of the
specified currency against the U.S. dollar could result in a decrease in the
dollar-equivalent value of payments on the debt security, including the
principal payable at maturity or the settlement value payable upon exercise.
That, in turn, could cause the market value of the debt security to fall.
Depreciation of the specified currency against the U.S. dollar could result in
a loss to the investor on a U.S. dollar basis.

Government Policy Can Adversely Affect Currency Exchange Rates and an
Investment in a Non-U.S. Dollar Debt Security

     Currency exchange rates can either float or be fixed by sovereign
governments. From time to time, governments use a variety of techniques, such
as intervention by a country's central bank or imposition of regulatory
controls or taxes, to affect the exchange rate of their currencies. Governments
may also issue a new currency to replace an existing currency or alter the
exchange rate or exchange characteristics by devaluation or revaluation of a
currency. Thus, a special risk in purchasing non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt
securities is that their U.S. dollar-equivalent yields or payouts could be
significantly and unpredictably affected by governmental

                                      18

<PAGE>

actions. Even in the absence of governmental action directly affecting currency
exchange rates, political or economic developments in the country issuing the
specified currency for a non-dollar debt security or elsewhere could lead to
significant and sudden changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and
the specified currency. These changes could affect the U.S. dollar equivalent
value of the debt security as participants in the global currency markets move
to buy or sell the specified currency or U.S. dollars in reaction to those
developments.

     Governments have imposed from time to time and may in the future impose
exchange controls or other conditions with respect to the exchange or transfer
of a specified currency that could affect exchange rates as well as the
availability of a specified currency for a debt security at its maturity or on
any other payment date. In addition, the ability of a holder to move currency
freely out of the country in which payments are made, or to convert the
currency at a freely determined market rate could be limited by governmental
actions.

Non-U.S. Dollar Debt Securities May Permit Us to Make Payments in Dollars or
Delay Payment if We Are Unable to Obtain the Specified Currency

     Debt securities payable in a currency other than U.S. dollars will provide
that, if the other currency is not available to us at or about the time when a
payment on the debt securities comes due because of circumstances beyond our
control, we will be entitled to make the payment in U.S. dollars or delay
making the payment. These circumstances could include the imposition of
exchange controls or our inability to obtain the currency because of a
disruption in the currency markets. If we made payment in U.S. dollars, the
exchange rate we would use may be for a date substantially before the payment
date. In addition, a determination of the exchange rate may be based on limited
information and would involve significant discretion on the part of our
exchange rate agent, which may be an affiliate of ours. As a result, the value
of the payment in U.S. dollars an investor would receive on the payment date
may not reflect currency market conditions at the time of payment and may be
less than the value of the payment the investor would have received in the
other currency if it had been available, or may be zero. In addition, a
government may impose extraordinary taxes on transfers of a currency. If that
happens we will be entitled to deduct these taxes from any payment on
securities payable in that currency.

Payments Due in Other Currencies May Be Made From an Overseas Bank

     Currently, there are limited facilities in the United States for
conversion of U.S. dollars into foreign currencies, and vice versa.
Accordingly, payments on debt securities made in a specified currency other
than U.S. dollars are likely to be made from an account with a bank located in
the country issuing the specified currency.

We Will Not Adjust Non-U.S. Dollar Debt Securities to Compensate for Changes in
Currency Exchange Rates

     Except as described in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will not
make any adjustment or change in the terms of a debt security payable in a
currency other than U.S. dollars in the event of any change in exchange rates
for that currency, whether in the event of any devaluation, revaluation or
imposition of exchange or other regulatory controls or taxes or in the event of
other developments affecting that currency, the U.S. dollar or any other
currency. Consequently, investors in non-U.S. dollar debt securities will bear
the risk that their investment may be adversely affected by these types of
events.

In a Lawsuit for Payment on a Non-Dollar Debt Security, an Investor May Bear
Currency Exchange Risk

     The debt securities we are offering will be governed by New York law.
Under New York law, a New York state court rendering a judgment on a debt
security denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars would be required to
render the judgment in the specified currency; however, the judgment would be
converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of
entry of the judgment. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on a debt
security denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, investors would
bear currency exchange risk until a New York state court judgment is entered,
which could be a long time.

                                      19

<PAGE>

     In courts outside of New York, investors may not be able to obtain a
judgment in a specified currency other than U.S. dollars. For example, a
judgment for money in an action based on a non-U.S. dollar debt security in
many other federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United
States only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion
of the currency in which any particular security is denominated into U.S.
dollars will depend upon various factors, including which court renders the
judgment.

Determinations Made by the Exchange Rate Agent

     All determinations made by the exchange rate agent will be made in its
sole discretion (except to the extent expressly provided in the applicable
prospectus supplement or pricing supplement). In the absence of manifest error,
its determinations will be conclusive for all purposes and will bind all
holders and us. The exchange rate agent will not have any liability for its
determinations.

                    LEGAL OWNERSHIP AND BOOK-ENTRY ISSUANCE

     References to AIG, us, we or our in this section mean American
International Group, Inc. and do not include the subsidiaries of American
International Group, Inc. In this section, we describe special considerations
that will apply to registered securities issued in global -- i.e., book-entry
-- form. First, we describe the difference between legal ownership and indirect
ownership of registered securities. Then we describe special provisions that
apply to global securities. When we use the term securities in this section,
we mean the debt securities we may offer with this prospectus.

Who is the Legal Owner of a Registered Security?

     Each security in registered form will be represented either by a
certificate issued in definitive form to a particular investor or by one or
more global securities representing such securities. We refer to those who have
securities registered in their own names, on the books that we or the trustee
maintain for this purpose, as the holders of those securities. These persons
are the legal holders of the securities. We refer to those who, indirectly
through others, own beneficial interests in securities that are not registered
in their own names as indirect owners of those securities. As we discuss below,
indirect owners are not legal holders, and investors in securities issued in
book-entry form or in street name will be indirect owners.

Book-Entry Owners

     Unless otherwise noted in your prospectus supplement, we will issue each
security in book-entry form only. This means securities will be represented by
one or more global securities registered in the name of a financial institution
that holds them as depositary on behalf of other financial institutions that
participate in the depositary's book-entry system. These participating
institutions, in turn, hold beneficial interests in the securities on behalf of
themselves or their customers.

     Under the senior debt indenture, only the person in whose name a security
is registered on the records of the registrar is recognized as the holder of
that security. Consequently, for securities issued in global form, we will
recognize only the depositary described below under -- What is a Global"
"17447","Security? as the holder of the securities and we will make all payments on the
securities, including deliveries of any property other than cash, to that
depositary. The depositary passes along the payments it receives to its
participants, which in turn pass the payments along to their customers who are
the beneficial owners. The depositary and its participants do so under
agreements they have made with one another or with their customers; they are
not obligated to do so under the terms of the securities.

     As a result, investors will not own securities directly. Instead, they
will own beneficial interests in a global security, through a bank, broker or
other financial institution that participates in the depositary's book-entry
system or holds an interest through a participant. As long as the securities
are issued in global form, investors will be indirect owners, and not holders,
of the securities.

Street Name Owners

     We may terminate an existing global security or issue securities initially
in non-global form. In these cases, investors may choose to hold their
securities in their own names or in street name. Securities held by an investor
in street name would be registered in the name of a bank, broker or other
financial institution that the investor chooses, and the investor would hold
only a beneficial interest in those securities through an account he or she
maintains at that institution.

     For securities held in street name, we will recognize only the
intermediary banks, brokers and other financial institutions in whose names the
securities are registered as the holders of those securities and we will make
all payments on those securities, including deliveries of any property other
than cash, to them. These institutions pass along the payments they receive to
their customers who are the beneficial owners, but only

                                      21

<PAGE>

because they agree to do so in their customer agreements or because they are
legally required to do so. Investors who hold securities in street name will be
indirect owners, not holders, of those securities.

Legal Holders

     Our obligations, as well as the obligations of the trustee under the
senior debt indenture and the obligations, if any, of any third parties
employed by us or the trustee, run only to the holders of the securities. We do
not have obligations to investors who hold beneficial interests in global
securities, in street name or by any other indirect means. This will be the
case whether an investor chooses to be an indirect owner of a security or has
no choice because we are issuing the securities only in global form.

     For example, once we make a payment or give a notice to the holder, we
have no further responsibility for that payment or notice even if that holder
is required, under agreements with depositary participants or customers or by
law, to pass it along to the indirect owners but does not do so. Similarly, if
we want to obtain the approval of the holders for any purpose -- for example,
to amend the senior debt indenture for a series of securities or to relieve us
of the consequences of a default or of our obligation to comply with a
particular provision of the indenture -- we would seek the approval only from
the holders, and not the indirect owners, of the relevant securities. Whether
and how the holders contact the indirect owners is up to the holders.

     When we refer to you in this prospectus, we mean all purchasers of the
securities being offered by this prospectus, whether they are the holders or
indirect owners of those securities. When we refer to your securities in this
prospectus, we mean the securities in which you will hold a direct or indirect
interest.

Special Considerations for Indirect Owners

     If you hold securities through a bank, broker or other financial
institution, either in book-entry form or in street name, you should check with
your own institution to find out:

    .   how it handles securities payments and notices;

    .   whether it imposes fees or charges;

    .   how it would handle a request for the holders' consent, if ever
        required;

    .   whether and how you can instruct it to send you securities registered
        in your own name so you can be a holder, if that is permitted in the
        future;

    .   how it would exercise rights under the securities if there were a
        default or other event triggering the need for holders to act to
        protect their interests; and

    .   if the securities are in book-entry form, how the depositary's rules
        and procedures will affect these matters.

What is a Global Security?

     Unless otherwise noted in the applicable prospectus supplement or pricing
supplement, we will issue each security in book-entry form only. Each security
issued in book-entry form will be represented by a global security that we
deposit with and register in the name of one or more financial institutions or
clearing systems, or their nominees, which we select. A financial institution
or clearing system that we select for any security for this purpose is called
the depositary for that security. A security will usually have only one
depositary but it may have more. Each series of securities will have one or
more of the following as the depositaries:

    .   The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York, which is known as
        DTC;

    .   Euroclear System, which is known as Euroclear;

                                      22

<PAGE>

    .   Clearstream Banking, societe anonyme, Luxembourg, which is known as
        Clearstream; and

    .   any other clearing system or financial institution named in the
        applicable prospectus supplement.

     The depositaries named above may also be participants in one another's
systems. Thus, for example, if DTC is the depositary for a global security,
investors may hold beneficial interests in that security through Euroclear or
Clearstream, as DTC participants. The depositary or depositaries for your
securities will be named in your prospectus supplement; if none is named, the
depositary will be DTC.

     A global security may represent one or any other number of individual
securities. Generally, all securities represented by the same global security
will have the same terms. We may, however, issue a global security that
represents multiple securities of the same kind, such as debt securities, that
have different terms and are issued at different times. We call this kind of
global security a master global security. Your prospectus supplement will not
indicate whether your securities are represented by a master global security.

     A global security may not be transferred to or registered in the name of
anyone other than the depositary or its nominee, unless special termination
situations arise. We describe those situations below under -- Holder's Option"
"17448","to Obtain a Non-Global Security: Special Situations When a Global Security Will"
"17449","Be Terminated. As a result of these arrangements, the depositary, or its
nominee, will be the sole registered owner and holder of all securities
represented by a global security, and investors will be permitted to own only
indirect interests in a global security. Indirect interests must be held by
means of an account with a broker, bank or other financial institution that in
turn has an account with the depositary or with another institution that does.
Thus, an investor whose security is represented by a global security will not
be a holder of the security, but only an indirect owner of an interest in the
global security.

     If the prospectus supplement for a particular security indicates that the
security will be issued in global form only, then the security will be
represented by a global security at all times unless and until the global
security is terminated. We describe the situations in which this can occur
below under -- Holder's Option to Obtain a Non- Global Security: Special"
"17450","Situations When a Global Security Will Be Terminated. If termination occurs,
we may issue the securities through another book-entry clearing system or
decide that the securities may no longer be held through any book-entry
clearing system.

Special Considerations for Global Securities

     As an indirect owner, an investor's rights relating to a global security
will be governed by the rules of the depositary and those of the investor's
bank, broker, financial institution or other intermediary through which it
holds its interest (e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream, if DTC is the depositary),
as well as general laws relating to securities transfers. We do not recognize
this type of investor or any intermediary as a holder of securities and instead
deal only with the depositary that holds the global security.

     If securities are issued only in the form of a global security, an
investor should be aware of the following:

    .   An investor cannot cause the securities to be registered in his or her
        own name, and cannot obtain non-global certificates for his or her
        interest in the securities, except in the special situations we
        describe below;

    .   An investor will be an indirect holder and must look to his or her own
        bank, broker or other financial institution for payments on the
        securities and protection of his or her legal rights relating to the
        securities, as we describe above under -- Who is the Legal Owner of a"
"17451","        Registered Security?;

    .   An investor may not be able to sell interests in the securities to some
        insurance companies and other institutions that are required by law to
        own their securities in non-book-entry form;

                                      23

<PAGE>

    .   An investor may not be able to pledge his or her interest in a global
        security in circumstances where certificates representing the
        securities must be delivered to the lender or other beneficiary of the
        pledge in order for the pledge to be effective;

    .   The depositary's policies will govern payments, deliveries, transfers,
        exchanges, notices and other matters relating to an investor's interest
        in a global security, and those policies may change from time to time.
        We and the trustee will have no responsibility for any aspect of the
        depositary's policies, actions or records of ownership interests in a
        global security. Neither we nor the trustee supervise the depositary in
        any way;

    .   The depositary may require that those who purchase and sell interests
        in a global security within its book-entry system use immediately
        available funds, and your bank, broker or other financial institution
        may require you to do so as well; and

    .   Financial institutions that participate in the depositary's book-entry
        system and through which an investor holds its interest in the global
        securities, directly or indirectly, may also have their own policies
        affecting payments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices and other
        matters relating to the securities, and those policies may change from
        time to time. For example, if you hold an interest in a global security
        through Euroclear or Clearstream, when DTC is the depositary, Euroclear
        or Clearstream, as applicable, may require those who purchase and sell
        interests in that security through them to use immediately available
        funds and comply with other policies and procedures, including
        deadlines for giving instructions as to transactions that are to be
        effected on a particular day. There may be more than one financial
        intermediary in the chain of ownership for an investor. We do not
        monitor and are not responsible for the policies or actions or records
        of ownership interests of any of those intermediaries.

Holder's Option to Obtain a Non-Global Security: Special Situations When a
Global Security Will Be Terminated

     If we issue any series of securities in book-entry form but we choose to
give the beneficial owners of that series the right to obtain non-global
securities, any beneficial owner entitled to obtain non-global securities may
do so by following the applicable procedures of the depositary, any transfer
agent or registrar for that series and that owner's bank, broker or other
financial institution through which that owner holds its beneficial interest in
the securities. If you are entitled to request a non-global certificate and
wish to do so, you will need to allow sufficient lead time to enable us or our
agent to prepare the requested certificate.

     In addition, in a few special situations described below, a global
security will be terminated and interests in it will be exchanged for
certificates in non-global form representing the securities it represented.
After that exchange, the choice of whether to hold the securities directly or
in street name will be up to the investor. Investors must consult their own
banks, brokers or other financial institutions, to find out how to have their
interests in a global security transferred on termination to their own names,
so that they will be holders. We have described the rights of holders and
street name investors above under -- Who is the Legal Owner of a Registered"
"17452","Security?

     Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement or
pricing supplement, the special situations for termination of a global security
are as follows:

    .   if the depositary notifies us that it is unwilling, unable or no longer
        qualified to continue as depositary for that global security;

    .   if we determine and notify the trustee that we wish to terminate that
        global security; or

    .   if an event of default has occurred with regard to these securities and
        has not been cured or waived.

                                      24

<PAGE>

     If a global security is terminated, only the depositary, and not we or the
trustee for any securities, is responsible for deciding the names of the
institutions in whose names the securities represented by the global security
will be registered and, therefore, who will be the holders of those securities.

Considerations Relating to DTC

     DTC has informed us as follows:

     DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York
Banking Law, a banking organization within the meaning of the New York
Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation
within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing"
"17453","agency registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange
Act. DTC holds securities that DTC participants deposit with DTC. DTC also
facilitates the post-trade settlement among DTC participants of sales and other
securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized
book-entry transfers and pledges between DTC participants' accounts. This
eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC
participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations.
DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation
(DTCC). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing
Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered
clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries.
Indirect access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S.
and non-U.S. brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing
corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC
participant, either directly or indirectly. The rules applicable to DTC and DTC
participants are on file with the SEC.

     Purchases of securities within the DTC system must be made by or through
DTC participants, which will receive a credit for the securities on DTC's
records. The ownership interest of each actual acquirer of new securities is in
turn to be recorded on the direct and indirect participants' records, including
Euroclear and Clearstream. Transfers of ownership interests in the securities
are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of participants acting on
behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners will not receive written
confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial owners will not receive
certificates representing their ownership interests in the securities, except
in the limited circumstances described above under -- Holder's Option to"
"17454","Obtain a Non-Global Security: Special Situations When a Global Security Will Be"
"17455","Terminated.

     To facilitate subsequent transfers, the securities deposited by direct
participants with DTC will be registered in the name of DTC's partnership
nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized
representative of DTC. The deposit of securities with DTC and their
registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other nominee will not change
the beneficial ownership of the securities. DTC has no knowledge of the actual
beneficial owners of the securities. DTC's records reflect only the identity of
the direct participants to whose accounts the securities are credited, which
may or may not be the beneficial owners. The participants are responsible for
keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

     Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to its direct
participants, by its direct participants to indirect participants, and by its
direct and indirect participants to beneficial owners of the securities will be
governed by arrangements among them, respectively, subject to any statutory or
regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.

     Redemption notices will be sent to DTC. If less than all of the securities
are being redeemed, DTC will determine the amount of the interest of each
direct participant to be redeemed in accordance with its then current
procedures.

     In instances in which a vote is required, neither DTC nor Cede & Co. will
itself consent or vote with respect to the securities. Under its usual
procedures, DTC would mail an omnibus proxy to the relevant trustee as soon as
possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns Cede & Co.'s
consenting or voting rights to

                                      25

<PAGE>

those direct participants to whose accounts such securities are credited on the
record date (identified in a listing attached to the omnibus proxy).

     Distribution payments on the securities will be made by the relevant
trustee to Cede & Co., or other nominee as may be requested by an authorized
representative of DTC. DTC's usual practice is to credit direct participants'
accounts upon DTC's receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from
the relevant trustee on the relevant payment date in accordance with their
respective holdings shown on DTC's records. Payments by DTC participants to
beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary
practices and will be the responsibility of such participants and not of DTC,
the relevant trustee or us, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements
as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of distributions to Cede & Co.
(or other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC)
is the responsibility of the relevant trustee, disbursements of such payments
to direct participants are the responsibility of DTC, and disbursements of such
payments to the beneficial owners are the responsibility of direct and indirect
participants.

Considerations Relating to Euroclear and Clearstream

     Euroclear and Clearstream are securities clearance systems in Europe. Both
systems clear and settle securities transactions between their participants
through electronic, book-entry delivery of securities against payment.

     Euroclear and Clearstream may be depositaries for a global security. In
addition, if DTC is the depositary for a global security, Euroclear and
Clearstream may hold interests in the global security as participants in DTC.

     As long as any global security is held by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
depositary, you may hold an interest in the global security only through an
organization that participates, directly or indirectly, in Euroclear or
Clearstream. If Euroclear or Clearstream is the depositary for a global
security and there is no depositary in the United States, you will not be able
to hold interests in that global security through any securities clearance
system in the United States.

     Payments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices and other matters
relating to the securities made through Euroclear or Clearstream must comply
with the rules and procedures of those systems. Those systems could change
their rules and procedures at any time. We have no control over those systems
or their participants and we take no responsibility for their activities.
Transactions between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the one hand,
and participants in DTC, on the other hand, when DTC is the depositary, would
also be subject to DTC's rules and procedures.

Special Timing Considerations Relating to Transactions in Euroclear and
Clearstream

     Investors will be able to make and receive through Euroclear and
Clearstream payments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices and other
transactions involving any securities held through those systems only on days
when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for
business on days when banks, brokers and other financial institutions are open
for business in the United States.

     In addition, because of time-zone differences, U.S. investors who hold
their interests in the securities through these systems and wish to transfer
their interests, or to receive or make a payment or delivery or exercise any
other right with respect to their interests, on a particular day may find that
the transaction will not be effected until the next business day in Luxembourg
or Brussels, as applicable. Thus, investors who wish to exercise rights that
expire on a particular day may need to act before the expiration date. In
addition, investors who hold their interests through both DTC and Euroclear or
Clearstream may need to make special arrangements to finance any purchases or
sales of their interests between the U.S. and European clearing systems, and
those transactions may settle later than would be the case for transactions
within one clearing system.

                MATERIAL UNITED STATES TAXATION CONSIDERATIONS

     This section describes the material United States federal income tax
consequences of owning certain of the debt securities, common stock, preferred
stock and depositary shares we are offering. The material United States federal
income tax consequences of owning the debt securities described below under --"
"17456","Taxation of Debt Securities -- United States Holders -- Other Debt Securities,
and of owning preferred stock that may be convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for securities or other property will be described in the
applicable prospectus supplement. This section is the opinion of Sullivan &
Cromwell LLP. It applies to you only if you hold your securities as capital
assets for tax purposes. This section does not apply to you if you are a member
of a class of holders subject to special rules, such as:

    .   a dealer in securities or currencies;

    .   a trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-market method of
        accounting for your securities holdings;

    .   a bank;

    .   an insurance company;

    .   a thrift institution;

    .   a regulated investment company;

    .   a tax-exempt organization;

    .   a person that owns debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or
        depositary shares that are a hedge or that are hedged against interest
        rate or currency risks;

    .   a person subject to the alternative minimum tax;

    .   a person that owns debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or
        depositary shares as part of a straddle or conversion transaction for
        tax purposes;

    .   a person that purchases or sells debt securities, common stock,
        preferred stock or depositary shares as part of a wash sale for tax
        purposes; or

    .   a United States holder (as defined below) whose functional currency for
        tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar.

     This section is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the Code), its legislative history, existing and proposed
regulations under the Code, published rulings and court decisions, all as
currently in effect. These laws are subject to change, possibly on a
retroactive basis.

     If a partnership holds the debt securities, common stock, preferred stock
or depositary shares, the United States federal income tax treatment of a
partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax
treatment of the partnership. A partner in a partnership holding debt
securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares should consult
its tax advisor with regard to the United States federal income tax treatment
of an investment in the debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or
depositary shares.

     Please consult your own tax advisor concerning the consequences of owning
these securities in your particular circumstances under the Code and the laws
of any other taxing jurisdiction.

                                      27

<PAGE>

     You are a United States holder if you are a beneficial owner of a debt
security, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares, and you are:

    .   a citizen or resident of the United States;

    .   a domestic corporation;

    .   an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax
        regardless of its source; or

    .   a trust if a United States court can exercise primary supervision over
        the trust's administration and one or more United States persons are
        authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust.

     You are a United States alien holder if you are the beneficial owner of a
debt security, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares, and you are,
for United States federal income tax purposes:

    .   a nonresident alien individual;

    .   a foreign corporation; or

    .   an estate or trust that in either case is not subject to United States
        federal income tax on a net income basis on income or gain from a debt
        security, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares.

                          Taxation of Debt Securities

     This subsection describes the material United States federal income tax
consequences of owning, selling and disposing of the debt securities we are
offering, other than the debt securities described below under -- United"
"17457","States Holders -- Other Debt Securities, which will be described in the
applicable prospectus supplement. It deals only with debt securities that are
due to mature 30 years or less from the date on which they are issued. The
United States federal income tax consequences of owning debt securities that
are due to mature more than 30 years from their date of issue will be discussed
in the applicable prospectus supplement.

United States Holders

Payments of Interest

     Except as described below in the case of interest on an original issue
discount debt security that is not qualified stated interest, each as defined
below under -- Original Issue Discount, you will be taxed on any interest on
your debt security, whether payable in U.S. dollars or a non-U.S. dollar
currency, including a composite currency or basket of currencies other than
U.S. dollars, as ordinary income at the time you receive the interest or when
it accrues, depending on your method of accounting for tax purposes.

  Cash Basis Taxpayers

     If you are a taxpayer that uses the cash receipts and disbursements method
of accounting for tax purposes and you receive an interest payment that is
denominated in, or determined by reference to, a non-U.S. dollar currency, you
must recognize income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment,
based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of
whether you actually convert the payment into U.S. dollars.

  Accrual Basis Taxpayers

     If you are a taxpayer that uses an accrual method of accounting for tax
purposes, you may determine the amount of income that you recognize with
respect to an interest payment denominated in, or determined by

                                      28

<PAGE>

reference to, a non-U.S. dollar currency by using one of two methods. Under the
first method, you will determine the amount of income accrued based on the
average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period or, with
respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, that part of the
period within the taxable year.

     If you elect the second method, you would determine the amount of income
accrued on the basis of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the
accrual period, or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable
years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period
within the taxable year. Additionally, under this second method, if you receive
a payment of interest within five business days of the last day of your accrual
period or taxable year, you may instead translate the interest accrued into
U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the day that you actually
receive the interest payment. If you elect the second method, it will apply to
all debt instruments that you hold at the beginning of the first taxable year
to which the election applies and to all debt instruments that you subsequently
acquire. You may not revoke this election without the consent of the United
States Internal Revenue Service.

     When you actually receive an interest payment, including a payment
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or retirement of your
debt security, denominated in, or determined by reference to, a non-U.S. dollar
currency for which you accrued an amount of income, you will recognize ordinary
income or loss measured by the difference, if any, between the exchange rate
that you used to accrue interest income and the exchange rate in effect on the
date of receipt, regardless of whether you actually convert the payment into
U.S. dollars.

Original Issue Discount

     If you own a debt security, other than a short-term debt security with a
term of one year or less, it will be treated as an original issue discount debt
security if the amount by which the debt security's stated redemption price at
maturity exceeds its issue price is more than a de minimis amount. Generally, a
debt security's issue price will be the first price at which a substantial
amount of debt securities included in the issue of which the debt security is a
part is sold to persons other than bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or
organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or
wholesalers. A debt security's stated redemption price at maturity is the total
of all payments provided by the debt security that are not payments of
qualified stated interest. Generally, an interest payment on a debt security is
qualified stated interest if it is one of a series of stated interest payments
on a debt security that are unconditionally payable at least annually at a
single fixed rate, with certain exceptions for lower rates paid during some
periods, applied to the outstanding principal amount of the debt security.
There are special rules for variable rate debt securities that are discussed
below under -- Variable Rate Debt Securities.

     In general, your debt security is not an original issue discount debt
security if the amount by which its stated redemption price at maturity exceeds
its issue price is less than the de minimis amount of 0.25 percent of its
stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years
to its maturity. Your debt security will have de minimis original issue
discount if the amount of the excess is less than the de minimis amount. If
your debt security has de minimis original issue discount, you must include the
de minimis amount in income as stated principal payments are made on the debt
security, unless you make the election described below under -- Election to"
"17458","Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount. You can determine the
includible amount with respect to each such payment by multiplying the total
amount of your debt security's de minimis original issue discount by a fraction
equal to:

    .   the amount of the principal payment made divided by:

    .   the stated principal amount of the debt security.

     Generally, if your original issue discount debt security matures more than
one year from its date of issue, you must include original issue discount in
income before you receive cash attributable to that income. The amount of
original issue discount that you must include in income is calculated using a
constant-yield method,

                                      29

<PAGE>

and generally you will include increasingly greater amounts of original issue
discount in income over the life of your debt security. More specifically, you
can calculate the amount of original issue discount that you must include in
income by adding the daily portions of original issue discount with respect to
your original issue discount debt security for each day during the taxable year
or portion of the taxable year that you hold your original issue discount debt
security. You can determine the daily portion by allocating to each day in any
accrual period a pro rata portion of the original issue discount allocable to
that accrual period. You may select an accrual period of any length with
respect to your original issue discount debt security and you may vary the
length of each accrual period over the term of your original issue discount
debt security. However, no accrual period may be longer than one year and each
scheduled payment of interest or principal on the original issue discount debt
security must occur on either the first or final day of an accrual period.

     You can determine the amount of original issue discount allocable to an
accrual period by:

    .   multiplying your original issue discount debt security's adjusted issue
        price at the beginning of the accrual period by your debt security's
        yield to maturity; and then

    .   subtracting from this figure the sum of the payments of qualified
        stated interest on your debt security allocable to the accrual period.

     You must determine the original issue discount debt security's yield to
maturity on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and
adjusting for the length of each accrual period. Further, you determine your
original issue discount debt security's adjusted issue price at the beginning
of any accrual period by:

    .   adding your original issue discount debt security's issue price and any
        accrued original issue discount for each prior accrual period; and then

    .   subtracting any payments previously made on your original issue
        discount debt security that were not qualified stated interest payments.

     If an interval between payments of qualified stated interest on your
original issue discount debt security contains more than one accrual period,
then, when you determine the amount of original issue discount allocable to an
accrual period, you must allocate the amount of qualified stated interest
payable at the end of the interval, including any qualified stated interest
that is payable on the first day of the accrual period immediately following
the interval, pro rata to each accrual period in the interval based on their
relative lengths. In addition, you must increase the adjusted issue price at
the beginning of each accrual period in the interval by the amount of any
qualified stated interest that has accrued prior to the first day of the
accrual period but that is not payable until the end of the interval. You may
compute the amount of original issue discount allocable to an initial short
accrual period by using any reasonable method if all other accrual periods,
other than a final short accrual period, are of equal length.

     The amount of original issue discount allocable to the final accrual
period is equal to the difference between:

    .   the amount payable at the maturity of your debt security, other than
        any payment of qualified stated interest; and

    .   your debt security's adjusted issue price as of the beginning of the
        final accrual period.

  Acquisition Premium

     If you purchase your debt security for an amount that is less than or
equal to the sum of all amounts, other than qualified stated interest, payable
on your debt security after the purchase date but is greater than the amount

                                      30

<PAGE>

of your debt security's adjusted issue price, as determined above, the excess
is acquisition premium. If you do not make the election described below under
-- Election to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount, then you must
reduce the daily portions of original issue discount by a fraction equal to:

    .   the excess of your adjusted basis in the debt security immediately
        after purchase over the adjusted issue price of the debt security
        divided by:

    .   the excess of the sum of all amounts payable, other than qualified
        stated interest, on the debt security after the purchase date over the
        debt security's adjusted issue price.

  Pre-Issuance Accrued Interest

     An election may be made to decrease the issue price of your debt security
by the amount of pre-issuance accrued interest if:

    .   a portion of the initial purchase price of your debt security is
        attributable to pre-issuance accrued interest;

    .   the first stated interest payment on your debt security is to be made
        within one year of your debt security's issue date; and

    .   the payment will equal or exceed the amount of pre-issuance accrued
        interest.

     If this election is made, a portion of the first stated interest payment
will be treated as a return of the excluded pre-issuance accrued interest and
not as an amount payable on your debt security.

  Debt Securities Subject to Contingencies Including Optional Redemption

     Your debt security is subject to a contingency if it provides for an
alternative payment schedule or schedules applicable upon the occurrence of a
contingency or contingencies, other than a remote or incidental contingency,
whether such contingency relates to payments of interest or of principal. In
such a case, you must determine the yield and maturity of your debt security by
assuming that the payments will be made according to the payment schedule most
likely to occur if:

    .   the timing and amounts of the payments that comprise each payment
        schedule are known as of the issue date; and

    .   one of such schedules is significantly more likely than not to occur.

     If there is no single payment schedule that is significantly more likely
than not to occur, other than because of a mandatory sinking fund, you must
include income on your debt security in accordance with the general rules that
govern contingent payment obligations. These rules will be discussed in the
applicable prospectus supplement.

     Notwithstanding the general rules for determining yield and maturity, if
your debt security is subject to contingencies, and either you or we have an
unconditional option or options that, if exercised, would require payments to
be made on the debt security under an alternative payment schedule or
schedules, then:

    .   in the case of an option or options that we may exercise, we will be
        deemed to exercise or not exercise an option or combination of options
        in the manner that minimizes the yield on your debt security; and

    .   in the case of an option or options that you may exercise, you will be
        deemed to exercise or not exercise an option or combination of options
        in the manner that maximizes the yield on your debt security.

                                      31

<PAGE>

     If both you and we hold options described in the preceding sentence, those
rules will apply to each option in the order in which they may be exercised.
You may determine the yield on your debt security for the purposes of those
calculations by using any date on which your debt security may be redeemed or
repurchased as the maturity date and the amount payable on the date that you
chose in accordance with the terms of your debt security as the principal
amount payable at maturity.

     If a contingency, including the exercise of an option, actually occurs or
does not occur contrary to an assumption made according to the above rules
then, except to the extent that a portion of your debt security is repaid as a
result of this change in circumstances and solely to determine the amount and
accrual of original issue discount, you must redetermine the yield and maturity
of your debt security by treating your debt security as having been retired and
reissued on the date of the change in circumstances for an amount equal to your
debt security's adjusted issue price on that date.

  Election to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount

     You may elect to include in gross income all interest that accrues on your
debt security using the constant-yield method described above, with the
modifications described below. For purposes of this election, interest will
include stated interest, original issue discount, de minimis original issue
discount, market discount, de minimis market discount and unstated interest, as
adjusted by any amortizable bond premium, described below under -- Debt"
"17459","Securities Purchased at a Premium, or acquisition premium.

     If you make this election for your debt security, then, when you apply the
constant-yield method:

    .   the issue price of your debt security will equal your cost;

    .   the issue date of your debt security will be the date you acquired it;
        and

    .   no payments on your debt security will be treated as payments of
        qualified stated interest.

     Generally, this election will apply only to the debt security for which
you make it; however, if the debt security has amortizable bond premium, you
will be deemed to have made an election to apply amortizable bond premium
against interest for all debt instruments with amortizable bond premium, other
than debt instruments the interest on which is excludible from gross income,
that you hold as of the beginning of the taxable year to which the election
applies or any taxable year thereafter. Additionally, if you make this election
for a market discount debt security, you will be treated as having made the
election discussed below under -- Market Discount to include market discount
in income currently over the life of all debt instruments having market
discount that you acquire on or after the first day of the first taxable year
to which the election applies. You may not revoke any election to apply the
constant-yield method to all interest on a debt security or the deemed
elections with respect to amortizable bond premium or market discount debt
securities without the consent of the United States Internal Revenue Service.

  Variable Rate Debt Securities

     Your debt security will be a variable rate debt security if:

    .   your debt security's issue price does not exceed the total
        noncontingent principal payments by more than the lesser of:

        .   .015 multiplied by the product of the total noncontingent principal
            payments and the number of complete years to maturity from the
            issue date; or

        .   15 percent of the total noncontingent principal payments; and

                                      32

<PAGE>

    .   your debt security provides for stated interest, compounded or paid at
        least annually, only at:

        .   one or more qualified floating rates;

        .   a single fixed rate and one or more qualified floating rates;

        .   a single objective rate; or

        .   a single fixed rate and a single objective rate that is a qualified
            inverse floating rate.

     Your debt security will have a variable rate that is a qualified floating
rate if:

    .   variations in the value of the rate can reasonably be expected to
        measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds
        in the currency in which your debt security is denominated; or

    .   the rate is equal to such a rate multiplied by either:

        .   a fixed multiple that is greater than 0.65 but not more than 1.35;
            or

        .   a fixed multiple greater than 0.65 but not more than 1.35,
            increased or decreased by a fixed rate; and

    .   the value of the rate on any date during the term of your debt security
        is set no earlier than three months prior to the first day on which
        that value is in effect and no later than one year following that first
        day.

     If your debt security provides for two or more qualified floating rates
that are within 0.25 percentage points of each other on the issue date or can
reasonably be expected to have approximately the same values throughout the
term of the debt security, the qualified floating rates together constitute a
single qualified floating rate.

     Your debt security will not have a qualified floating rate, however, if
the rate is subject to certain restrictions (including caps, floors, governors,
or other similar restrictions) unless such restrictions are fixed throughout
the term of the debt security or are not reasonably expected to significantly
affect the yield on the debt security.

     Your debt security will have a variable rate that is a single objective
rate if:

    .   the rate is not a qualified floating rate;

    .   the rate is determined using a single, fixed formula that is based on
        objective financial or economic information that is not within the
        control of or unique to the circumstances of the issuer or a related
        party; and

    .   the value of the rate on any date during the term of your debt security
        is set no earlier than three months prior to the first day on which
        that value is in effect and no later than one year following that first
        day.

     Your debt security will not have a variable rate that is an objective
rate, however, if it is reasonably expected that the average value of the rate
during the first half of your debt security's term will be either significantly
less than or significantly greater than the average value of the rate during
the final half of your debt security's term.

     An objective rate as described above is a qualified inverse floating rate
if:

    .   the rate is equal to a fixed rate minus a qualified floating rate and

    .   the variations in the rate can reasonably be expected to inversely
        reflect contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds.

                                      33

<PAGE>

     Your debt security will also have a single qualified floating rate or an
objective rate if interest on your debt security is stated at a fixed rate for
an initial period of one year or less followed by either a qualified floating
rate or an objective rate for a subsequent period, and either:

    .   the fixed rate and the qualified floating rate or objective rate have
        values on the issue date of the debt security that do not differ by
        more than 0.25 percentage points; or

    .   the value of the qualified floating rate or objective rate is intended
        to approximate the fixed rate.

     In general, if your variable rate debt security provides for stated
interest at a single qualified floating rate or objective rate, or one of those
rates after a single fixed rate for an initial period, all stated interest on
your debt security is qualified stated interest. In this case, the amount of
original issue discount, if any, is determined by using, in the case of a
qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate, the value as of the
issue date of the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate,
or, for any other objective rate, a fixed rate that reflects the yield
reasonably expected for your debt security.

     If your variable rate debt security does not provide for stated interest
at a single qualified floating rate or a single objective rate, and also does
not provide for interest payable at a fixed rate other than a single fixed rate
for an initial period, you generally must determine the interest and original
issue discount accruals on your debt security by:

    .   determining a fixed rate substitute for each variable rate provided
        under your variable rate debt security;

    .   constructing the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument, using the fixed
        rate substitute described above;

    .   determining the amount of qualified stated interest and original issue
        discount with respect to the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument; and

    .   adjusting for actual variable rates during the applicable accrual
        period.

When you determine the fixed rate substitute for each variable rate provided
under the variable rate debt security, you generally will use the value of each
variable rate as of the issue date or, for an objective rate that is not a
qualified inverse floating rate, a rate that reflects the reasonably expected
yield on your debt security.

     If your variable rate debt security provides for stated interest either at
one or more qualified floating rates or at a qualified inverse floating rate,
and also provides for stated interest at a single fixed rate other than at a
single fixed rate for an initial period, you generally must determine interest
and original issue discount accruals by using the method described in the
previous paragraph. However, your variable rate debt security will be treated,
for purposes of the first three steps of the determination, as if your debt
security had provided for a qualified floating rate, or a qualified inverse
floating rate, rather than the fixed rate. The qualified floating rate, or
qualified inverse floating rate, that replaces the fixed rate must be such that
the fair market value of your variable rate debt security as of the issue date
approximates the fair market value of an otherwise identical debt instrument
that provides for the qualified floating rate, or qualified inverse floating
rate, rather than the fixed rate.

  Short-Term Debt Securities

     In general, if you are an individual or other cash basis United States
holder of a short-term debt security, you are not required to accrue original
issue discount, as specially defined below for the purposes of this paragraph,
for United States federal income tax purposes unless you elect to do so
(although it is possible that you may be required to include any stated
interest in income as you receive it). If you are an accrual basis taxpayer, a
taxpayer in a special class, including, but not limited to, a regulated
investment company, common trust fund, or a certain type of pass-through
entity, or a cash basis taxpayer who so elects, you will be required to

                                      34

<PAGE>

accrue original issue discount on short-term debt securities on either a
straight-line basis or under the constant-yield method, based on daily
compounding. If you are not required and do not elect to include original issue
discount in income currently, any gain you realize on the sale or retirement of
your short-term debt security will be ordinary income to the extent of the
accrued original issue discount, which will be determined on a straight-line
basis unless you make an election to accrue the original issue discount under
the constant-yield method, through the date of sale or retirement. However, if
you are not required and do not elect to accrue original issue discount on your
short-term debt securities, you will be required to defer deductions for
interest on borrowings allocable to your short-term debt securities in an
amount not exceeding the deferred income until the deferred income is realized.

     When you determine the amount of original issue discount subject to these
rules, you must include all interest payments on your short-term debt security,
including stated interest, in your short-term debt security's stated redemption
price at maturity.

  Non-U.S. Dollar Currency Original Issue Discount Debt Securities

     If your original issue discount debt security is denominated in, or
determined by reference to, a non-U.S. dollar currency, you must determine
original issue discount for any accrual period on your original issue discount
debt security in the non-U.S. dollar currency and then translate the amount of
original issue discount into U.S. dollars in the same manner as stated interest
accrued by an accrual basis United States holder, as described above under --"
"17460","Payments of Interest. You may recognize ordinary income or loss when you
receive an amount attributable to original issue discount in connection with a
payment of interest or the sale or retirement of your debt security.

Market Discount

     You will be treated as if you purchased your debt security, other than a
short-term debt security, at a market discount, and your debt security will be
a market discount debt security if:

    .   you purchase your debt security for less than its issue price as
        determined above; and

    .   the difference between the debt security's stated redemption price at
        maturity or, in the case of an original issue discount debt security,
        the debt security's revised issue price, and the price you paid for
        your debt security is equal to or greater than 0.25 percent of your
        debt security's stated redemption price at maturity or revised issue
        price, respectively, multiplied by the number of complete years to the
        debt security's maturity. To determine the revised issue price of your
        debt security for these purposes, you generally add any original issue
        discount that has accrued on your debt security to its issue price.

     If your debt security's stated redemption price at maturity or, in the
case of an original issue discount debt security, its revised issue price,
exceeds the price you paid for the debt security by less than 0.25 percent
multiplied by the number of complete years to the debt security's maturity, the
excess constitutes de minimis market discount, and the rules discussed below
are not applicable to you.

     You must treat any gain you recognize on the maturity or disposition of
your market discount debt security as ordinary income to the extent of the
accrued market discount on your debt security. Alternatively, you may elect to
include market discount in income currently over the life of your debt
security. If you make this election, it will apply to all debt instruments with
market discount that you acquire on or after the first day of the first taxable
year to which the election applies. You may not revoke this election without
the consent of the United States Internal Revenue Service. If you own a market
discount debt security and do not make this election, you will generally be
required to defer deductions for interest on borrowings allocable to your debt
security in an amount not exceeding the accrued market discount on your debt
security until the maturity or disposition of your debt security.

                                      35

<PAGE>

     If you own a market discount debt security, the market discount will
accrue on a straight-line basis unless an election is made to accrue market
discount using a constant-yield method. If you make this election, it will
apply only to the debt security with respect to which it is made and you may
not revoke it. You would, however, not include accrued market discount in
income currently unless you elect to do so as described above.

Debt Securities Purchased at a Premium

     If you purchase your debt security for an amount in excess of its
principal amount, you may elect to treat the excess as amortizable bond
premium. If you make this election, you would reduce the amount required to be
included in your income each year with respect to interest on your debt
security by the amount of amortizable bond premium allocable to that year,
based on your debt security's yield to maturity. If your debt security is
denominated in, or determined by reference to, a non-U.S. dollar currency, you
would compute your amortizable bond premium in units of the non-U.S. dollar
currency and your amortizable bond premium will reduce your interest income in
units of the non-U.S. dollar currency. Gain or loss recognized that is
attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the time
your amortized bond premium offsets interest income and the time of the
acquisition of your debt security is generally taxable as ordinary income or
loss. If you make an election to amortize bond premium, it will apply to all
debt instruments, other than debt instruments the interest on which is
excludible from gross income, that you hold at the beginning of the first
taxable year to which the election applies or that you thereafter acquire, and
you may not revoke it without the consent of the United States Internal Revenue
Service. See also -- Original Issue Discount -- Election to Treat All Interest"
"17461","as Original Issue Discount.

Purchase, Sale and Retirement of the Debt Securities

     Your tax basis in your debt security will generally be the U.S. dollar
cost, as defined below, of your debt security, adjusted by:

    .   adding any original issue discount or market discount previously
        included in income with respect to your debt security; and then

    .   subtracting any payments on your debt security that are not qualified
        stated interest payments and any amortizable bond premium applied to
        reduce interest on your debt security.

     If you purchase your debt security with non-U.S. dollar currency, the U.S.
dollar cost of your debt security will generally be the U.S. dollar value of
the purchase price on the date of purchase. However, if you are a cash basis
taxpayer, or an accrual basis taxpayer if you so elect, and your debt security
is traded on an established securities market, as defined in the applicable
U.S. Treasury regulations, the U.S. dollar cost of your debt security will be
the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price on the settlement date of your
purchase.

     You will generally recognize gain or loss on the sale or retirement of
your debt security equal to the difference between the amount you realize on
the sale or retirement and your tax basis in your debt security. If your debt
security is sold or retired for an amount in non-U.S. dollar currency, the
amount you realize will be the U.S. dollar value of such amount on the date the
debt security is disposed of or retired, except that in the case of a debt
security that is traded on an established securities market, as defined in the
applicable Treasury regulations, a cash basis taxpayer, or an accrual basis
taxpayer that so elects, will determine the amount realized based on the U.S.
dollar value of the specified currency on the settlement date of the sale.

     You will recognize capital gain or loss when you sell or retire your debt
security, except to the extent:

    .   described above under -- Original Issue Discount -- Short-Term Debt"
"17462","        Securities or -- Market Discount;

                                      36

<PAGE>

    .   attributable to accrued but unpaid interest;

    .   the rules governing contingent payment obligations apply; or

    .   attributable to changes in exchange rates as described below.

     Capital gain of a noncorporate United States holder is generally taxed at
preferential rates where the debt security is held for more than one year.

     You must treat any portion of the gain or loss that you recognize on the
sale or retirement of a debt security as ordinary income or loss to the extent
attributable to changes in exchange rates. However, you take exchange gain or
loss into account only to the extent of the total gain or loss you realize on
the transaction.

Exchange of Amounts in Other Than U.S. Dollars

     If you receive non-U.S. dollar currency as interest on your debt security
or on the sale or retirement of your debt security, your tax basis in the
non-U.S. dollar currency will equal its U.S. dollar value when the interest is
received or at the time of the sale or retirement. If you purchase non-U.S.
dollar currency, you generally will have a tax basis equal to the U.S. dollar
value of the non-U.S. dollar currency on the date of your purchase. If you sell
or dispose of a non-U.S. dollar currency, including if you use it to purchase
debt securities or exchange it for U.S. dollars, any gain or loss recognized
generally will be ordinary income or loss.

Other Debt Securities

     The applicable prospectus supplement will discuss the material United
States federal income tax rules with respect to debt securities that may be
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common or preferred stock
or other securities of AIG parent or debt or equity securities of one or more
third parties, debt securities that are subject to the rules governing
contingent payment obligations, any renewable and extendible debt securities
and any debt securities providing for the periodic payment of principal over
the life of the debt security.

Medicare Tax

     For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, a U.S. holder that is
an individual or estate, or a trust that does not fall into a special class of
trusts that is exempt from such tax, will be subject to a 3.8% tax on the
lesser of (1) the U.S. holder's net investment income for the relevant
taxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S. holder's modified adjusted gross
income for the taxable year over a certain threshold (which in the case of
individuals will be between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the
individual's circumstances). A U.S. holder's net investment income will
generally include its interest income and its net gains from the disposition of
the debt securities, unless such interest income or net gains are derived in
the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade
or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities). If you are
a U.S. holder that is an individual, estate or trust, you are advised to
consult your tax advisors regarding the applicability of the Medicare tax to
your income and gains in respect of your investment in the debt securities.

United States Alien Holders

     This subsection describes the tax consequences to a United States alien
holder. This discussion assumes that the debt security is not subject to the
rules of Section 871(h)(4)(A) of the Code, relating to interest payments that
are determined by reference to the income, profits, changes in the value of
property or other attributes of the debtor or a related party.

     Under United States federal income and estate tax law, and subject to the
discussion of backup withholding below, if you are a United States alien holder
of a debt security:

    .   we and other U.S. payors generally will not be required to deduct
        United States withholding tax from payments of principal, premium, if
        any, and interest, including original issue discount, to you if, in the
        case of payments of interest:

        .   you do not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total
            combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote;

        .   you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to us
            through stock ownership;

        .   the U.S. payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know
            that you are a United States person and:

              .   you have furnished to the U.S. payor an Internal Revenue
                  Service Form W-8BEN or an acceptable substitute form upon
                  which you certify, under penalties of perjury, that you are
                  not a United States person;

              .   in the case of payments made outside the United States to you
                  at an offshore account (generally, an account maintained by
                  you at a bank or other financial institution at any location
                  outside the United States), you have furnished to the U.S.
                  payor documentation that establishes your identity and your
                  status as the beneficial owner of the payment for United
                  States federal income tax purposes and as a person who is not
                  a United States person;

              .   the U.S. payor has received a withholding certificate
                  (furnished on an appropriate Internal Revenue Service Form
                  W-8 or an acceptable substitute form) from a person claiming
                  to be:

                    .   a withholding foreign partnership (generally a foreign
                        partnership that has entered into an agreement with the
                        Internal Revenue Service to assume primary withholding
                        responsibility with respect to distributions and
                        guaranteed payments it makes to its partners);

                    .   a qualified intermediary (generally a non-United States
                        financial institution or clearing organization or a
                        non-United States branch or office of a United States
                        financial institution or clearing organization that is
                        a party to a withholding agreement with the United
                        States Internal Revenue Service); or

                    .   a U.S. branch of a non-United States bank or of a
                        non-United States insurance company;

                  and the withholding foreign partnership, qualified
                  intermediary or U.S. branch has received documentation upon
                  which it may rely to treat the payment as made to a person
                  who is not a United States person that is, for United States
                  federal income tax purposes, the beneficial owner of the
                  payments on the debt securities in accordance with U.S.
                  Treasury regulations (or, in the case of a qualified
                  intermediary, in accordance with its agreement with the
                  United States Internal Revenue Service);

              .   the U.S. payor receives a statement from a securities
                  clearing organization, bank or other financial institution
                  that holds customers' securities in the ordinary course of
                  its trade or business:

                    .   certifying to the U.S. payor under penalties of perjury
                        that an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or an
                        acceptable substitute form has been received from you
                        by it or by a similar financial institution between it
                        and you; and

                                      38

<PAGE>

                    .   to which is attached a copy of the Internal Revenue
                        Service Form W-8BEN or acceptable substitute form; or

              .   the U.S. payor otherwise possesses documentation upon which
                  it may rely to treat the payment as made to a person who is
                  not a United States person that is, for United States federal
                  income tax purposes, the beneficial owner of the payments on
                  the debt securities in accordance with U.S. Treasury
                  regulations; and

    .   no deduction for any United States federal withholding tax will be made
        from any gain that you realize on the sale or exchange of your debt
        security.

Further, a debt security held by an individual who at death is not a citizen or
resident of the United States will not be includible in the individual's gross
estate for United States federal estate tax purposes if:

    .   the decedent did not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the
        total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to
        vote at the time of death; and

    .   the income on the debt security would not have been effectively
        connected with a U.S. trade or business of the decedent at the same
        time.

Treasury Regulations Requiring Disclosure of Reportable Transactions

     Pursuant to Treasury regulations, United States taxpayers must report
certain transactions that give rise to a loss in excess of certain thresholds
(a Reportable Transaction). Under these regulations, if the debt securities
are denominated in a foreign currency, a United States holder (or a United
States alien holder that holds the debt securities in connection with a U.S.
trade or business) that recognizes a loss with respect to the debt securities
that is characterized as an ordinary loss due to changes in currency exchange
rates (under any of the rules discussed above) would be required to report the
loss on Internal Revenue Service Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Statement)
if the loss exceeds the thresholds set forth in the regulations. For
individuals and trusts, this loss threshold is $50,000 in any single taxable
year. For other types of taxpayers and other types of losses, the thresholds
are higher. You should consult with your tax advisor regarding any tax filing
and reporting obligations that may apply in connection with acquiring, owning
and disposing of debt securities.

Withholdable Payments to Foreign Financial Entities and Other Foreign Entities

     A 30% withholding tax will be imposed on certain payments that are made to
certain foreign financial institutions, investment funds and other non-U.S.
persons that fail to comply with information reporting requirements in respect
of their direct and indirect United States shareholders and/or United States
accountholders. Such payments will include U.S.-source interest and the gross
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of debt securities that can produce
U.S.-source interest. However, under proposed regulations, such payments will
only include interest and proceeds of debt securities issued on or after
January 1, 2013. In addition, under administrative guidance and proposed
regulations, withholding would only be made to payments of interest made on or
after January 1, 2014, and to payments of gross proceeds from a sale or other
disposition of debt securities made on or after January 1, 2015.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

     United States Holders.  In general, if you are a noncorporate United
States holder, we and other payors are required to report to the United States
Internal Revenue Service all payments of principal, any premium and interest on
your debt security, and the accrual of original issue discount on an original
issue discount debt security. In addition, we and other payors are required to
report to the United States Internal Revenue Service any payment of proceeds of
the sale of your debt security before maturity within the United States.
Additionally,

                                      39

<PAGE>

backup withholding will apply to any payments, including payments of original
issue discount, if you fail to provide an accurate taxpayer identification
number, or you are notified by the United States Internal Revenue Service that
you have failed to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on
your federal income tax returns.

     United States Alien Holders.  In general, if you are a United States alien
holder, payments of principal, premium or interest, including original issue
discount, made by us and other payors to you will not be subject to backup
withholding and information reporting, provided that the certification
requirements described above under -- United States Alien Holders are
satisfied or you otherwise establish an exemption. However, we and other payors
are required to report payments of interest on your debt securities on Internal
Revenue Service Form 1042-S even if the payments are not otherwise subject to
information reporting requirements. In addition, payment of the proceeds from
the sale of debt securities effected at a United States office of a broker will
not be subject to backup withholding and information reporting provided that:

    .   the broker does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you
        are a United States person and you have furnished to the broker:

        .   an appropriate Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or an acceptable
            substitute form upon which you certify, under penalties of perjury,
            that you are not a United States person; or

        .   other documentation upon which it may rely to treat the payment as
            made to a person who is not a United States person that is, for
            United States federal income tax purposes, the beneficial owner of
            the payment on the debt securities in accordance with U.S. Treasury
            regulations; or

    .   you otherwise establish an exemption.

     If you fail to establish an exemption and the broker does not possess
adequate documentation of your status as a person who is not a United States
person, the payments may be subject to information reporting and backup
withholding. However, backup withholding will not apply with respect to
payments made outside the United States to an offshore account maintained by
you unless the broker has actual knowledge that you are a United States person.

     In general, payment of the proceeds from the sale of debt securities
effected at a foreign office of a broker will not be subject to information
reporting or backup withholding. However, a sale effected at a foreign office
of a broker will be subject to information reporting and backup withholding if:

    .   the proceeds are transferred to an account maintained by you in the
        United States;

    .   the payment of proceeds or the confirmation of the sale is mailed to
        you at a United States address; or

    .   the sale has some other specified connection with the United States as
        provided in U.S. Treasury regulations;

unless the broker does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are
a United States person and the documentation requirements described above
(relating to a sale of debt securities effected at a United States office of a
broker) are met or you otherwise establish an exemption.

     In addition, payment of the proceeds from the sale of debt securities
effected at a foreign office of a broker will be subject to information
reporting if the broker is:

    .   a United States person;

    .   a controlled foreign corporation for United States tax purposes;

                                      40

<PAGE>

    .   a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income is effectively
        connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business for a
        specified three-year period; or

    .   a foreign partnership, if at any time during its tax year:

        .   one or more of its partners are United States persons, as defined
            in U.S. Treasury regulations, who in the aggregate hold more than
            50% of the income or capital interest in the partnership; or

        .   such foreign partnership is engaged in the conduct of a United
            States trade or business;

unless the broker does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are
a United States person and the documentation requirements described above
(relating to a sale of debt securities effected at a United States office of a
broker) are met or you otherwise establish an exemption. Backup withholding
will apply if the sale is subject to information reporting and the broker has
actual knowledge that you are a United States person.

        Taxation of Common Stock, Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares

     This subsection describes the material United States federal income tax
consequences of owning, selling and disposing of the common stock, preferred
stock and depositary shares that we may offer other than preferred stock that
may be convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, securities or
other property, which will be described in the applicable prospectus
supplement. When we refer to preferred stock in this subsection, we mean both
preferred stock and depositary shares.

United States Holders

Distributions

     You will be taxed on distributions on common stock or preferred stock as
dividend income to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings
and profits for United States federal income tax purposes. If you are a
noncorporate United States holder, dividends paid to you in taxable years
beginning before January 1, 2013 will be taxable to you at a maximum rate of
15%, provided that you hold your shares of common stock or preferred stock for
more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the
ex-dividend date (or, if a dividend is on preferred stock and is attributable
to a period or periods aggregating over 366 days, provided that you hold your
shares of preferred stock for more than 90 days during the 181-day period
beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date) and meet other holding period
requirements. If you are taxed as a corporation, except as described in the
next subsection, dividends would be eligible for the 70% dividends-received
deduction.

     You generally will not be taxed on any portion of a distribution not paid
out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits if your tax basis in the
common stock or preferred stock is greater than or equal to the amount of the
distribution. However, you would be required to reduce your tax basis (but not
below zero) in the common stock or preferred stock by the amount of the
distribution, and would recognize capital gain to the extent that the
distribution exceeds your tax basis in the common stock or preferred stock.
Further, if you are a corporation, you would not be entitled to a
dividends-received deduction on this portion of a distribution.

Limitations on Dividends-Received Deduction

     Corporate shareholders may not be entitled to take the 70%
dividends-received deduction in all circumstances. Prospective corporate
investors in common stock or preferred stock should consider the effect of:

    .   Section 246A of the Code, which reduces the dividends-received
        deduction allowed to a corporate shareholder that has incurred
        indebtedness that is directly attributable to an investment in
        certain portfolio stock;

                                      41

<PAGE>

    .   Section 246(c) of the Code, which, among other things, disallows the
        dividends-received deduction in respect of any dividend on a share of
        stock that is held for less than the minimum holding period (generally
        at least 46 days during the 91 day period beginning on the date which
        is 45 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with
        respect to such dividend); and

    .   Section 1059 of the Code, which, under certain circumstances, reduces
        the basis of stock for purposes of calculating gain or loss in a
        subsequent disposition by the portion of any extraordinary dividend
        (as defined below) that is eligible for the dividends-received
        deduction.

Extraordinary Dividends

     If you are a corporate shareholder, you will be required to reduce your
tax basis (but not below zero) in the common stock or preferred stock by the
nontaxed portion of any extraordinary dividend if you have not held your
stock for more than two years before the earliest of the date such dividend is
declared, announced, or agreed. Generally, the nontaxed portion of an
extraordinary dividend is the amount excluded from income by operation of the
dividends-received deduction. An extraordinary dividend on the common stock or
preferred stock generally would be a dividend that:

    .   equals or exceeds 5% (in the case of preferred stock) or 10% (in the
        case of common stock) of the corporate shareholder's adjusted tax basis
        in the common stock or preferred stock, treating all dividends having
        ex-dividend dates within an 85 day period as one dividend; or

    .   exceeds 20% of the corporate shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the
        common stock or preferred stock, treating all dividends having
        ex-dividend dates within a 365 day period as one dividend.

     In determining whether a dividend paid on the common stock or preferred
stock is an extraordinary dividend, a corporate shareholder may elect to
substitute the fair market value of the stock for its tax basis for purposes of
applying these tests if the fair market value as of the day before the
ex-dividend date is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the
Treasury. An extraordinary dividend also includes any amount treated as a
dividend in the case of a repurchase or redemption that is either non-pro rata
as to all stockholders or in partial liquidation of the company, regardless of
the stockholder's holding period and regardless of the size of the dividend.
Any part of the nontaxed portion of an extraordinary dividend that is not
applied to reduce the corporate shareholder's tax basis as a result of the
limitation on reducing its basis below zero would be treated as capital gain
and would be recognized in the taxable year in which the extraordinary dividend
is received.

     If you are a corporate shareholder, please consult your tax advisor with
respect to the possible application of the extraordinary dividend provisions of
the federal income tax law to your ownership or disposition of common stock or
preferred stock in your particular circumstances.

Redemption Premium

     If we may redeem your preferred stock at a redemption price in excess of
its issue price, the entire amount of the excess may constitute an unreasonable
redemption premium which will be treated as a constructive dividend. You
generally must take this constructive dividend into account each year in the
same manner as original issue discount would be taken into account if the
preferred stock were treated as an original issue discount debt security for
United States federal income tax purposes. See -- Taxation of Debt Securities"
"17463","-- United States Holders -- Original Issue Discount above for a discussion of
the special tax rules for original issue discount. A corporate shareholder
would be entitled to a dividends-received deduction for any constructive
dividends unless the special rules denying a dividends-received deduction
described above in -- Limitations on Dividends-Received Deduction apply. A
corporate shareholder would also be required to take these constructive
dividends into account when applying the extraordinary dividend rules described
above. Thus, a corporate

                                      42

<PAGE>

shareholder's receipt of a constructive dividend may cause some or all stated
dividends to be treated as extraordinary dividends. The applicable prospectus
supplement for preferred stock that is redeemable at a price in excess of its
issue price will indicate whether tax counsel believes that a shareholder must
include any redemption premium in income.

Sale or Exchange of Common Stock and Preferred Stock Other Than by Repurchase
or Redemption

     If you sell or otherwise dispose of your common stock or preferred stock
(other than by repurchase or redemption), you will generally recognize capital
gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the
disposition and your adjusted tax basis of the common stock or preferred stock.
Capital gain of a noncorporate United States holder is generally taxed at
preferential rates where the holder has a holding period greater than one year.

Repurchase or Redemption of Common Stock or Preferred Stock

     If we repurchase or redeem your common stock or preferred stock, it
generally would be a taxable event. You would be treated as if you had sold
your common stock or preferred stock if the repurchase or redemption:

    .   results in a complete termination of your stock interest in us;

    .   is substantially disproportionate with respect to you; or

    .   is not essentially equivalent to a dividend with respect to you.

     In determining whether any of these tests has been met, shares of stock
considered to be owned by you by reason of certain constructive ownership rules
set forth in Section 318 of the Code, as well as shares actually owned, must be
taken into account.

     If we repurchase or redeem your common stock or preferred stock in a
repurchase or redemption that meets one of the tests described above, you
generally would recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the sum of the amount
of cash and fair market value of property (other than stock of us or a
successor to us) received by you less your tax basis in the common stock or
preferred stock repurchased or redeemed. This gain or loss would be long-term
capital gain or capital loss if you have held the common stock or preferred
stock for more than one year.

     If a repurchase or redemption does not meet any of the tests described
above, you generally would be taxed on the cash and fair market value of the
property you receive as a dividend to the extent paid out of our current or
accumulated earnings and profits. Any amount in excess of our current and
accumulated earnings and profits would first reduce your tax basis in the
common stock or preferred stock and thereafter would be treated as capital
gain. If a repurchase or redemption of the common stock or preferred stock is
treated as a distribution that is taxable as a dividend, you should consult
with your own tax advisor regarding the treatment of your basis in the
repurchased or redeemed common stock or preferred stock.

Medicare Tax

     For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, a U.S. holder that is
an individual or estate, or a trust that does not fall into a special class of
trusts that is exempt from such tax, will be subject to a 3.8% tax on the
lesser of (1) the U.S. holder's net investment income for the relevant
taxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S. holder's modified adjusted gross
income for the taxable year over a certain threshold (which in the case of
individuals will be between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the
individual's circumstances). A U.S. holder's net investment income will
generally include its dividend income and its net gains from the disposition of
the common stock and preferred stock, unless such dividends or net gains are
derived in the ordinary course of

                                      43

the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade or business that
consists of certain passive or trading activities). If you are a U.S. holder
that is an individual, estate or trust, you are advised to consult your tax
advisors regarding the applicability of the Medicare tax to your income and
gains in respect of your investment in the common stock and preferred stock.

United States Alien Holders

     Except as described below, if you are a United States alien holder of
common stock or preferred stock, dividends paid to you are subject to
withholding of United States federal income tax at a 30% rate or at a lower
rate if you are eligible for the benefits of an income tax treaty that provides
for a lower rate. Even if you are eligible for a lower treaty rate, we and
other payors will generally be required to withhold at a 30% rate (rather than
the lower treaty rate) on dividend payments to you, unless you have furnished
to us or another payor:

    .   a valid Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or an acceptable
        substitute form upon which you certify, under penalties of perjury,
        your status as a person who is not a United States person and your
        entitlement to the lower treaty rate with respect to such payments; or

    .   in the case of payments made outside the United States to an offshore
        account (generally, an account maintained by you at an office or branch
        of a bank or other financial institution at any location outside the
        United States), other documentary evidence establishing your
        entitlement to the lower treaty rate in accordance with U.S. Treasury
        regulations.

     If you are eligible for a reduced rate of United States withholding tax
under a tax treaty, you may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld in excess
of that rate by filing a refund claim with the United States Internal Revenue
Service.

     If dividends paid to you are effectively connected with your conduct of
a trade or business within the United States, and, if required by a tax treaty,
the dividends are attributable to a permanent establishment that you maintain
in the United States, we and other payors generally are not required to
withhold tax from the dividends, provided that you have furnished to us or
another payor a valid Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or an acceptable
substitute form upon which you represent, under penalties of perjury, that:

    .   you are not a United States person; and

    .   the dividends are effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or
        business within the United States and are includible in your gross
        income.

     Effectively connected dividends are taxed at rates applicable to United
States citizens, resident aliens and domestic United States corporations.

     If you are a corporate United States alien holder, effectively connected
dividends that you receive may, under certain circumstances, be subject to an
additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or at a lower rate if you are
eligible for the benefits of an income tax treaty that provides for a lower
rate.

Gain on Disposition of Common Stock and Preferred Stock

     If you are a United States alien holder, you generally will not be subject
to United States federal income tax on gain that you recognize on a disposition
of common stock or preferred stock unless:

    .   the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or
        business in the United States, and the gain is attributable to a
        permanent establishment that you maintain in the United States, if that
        is required by an applicable income tax treaty as a condition for
        subjecting you to United States taxation on a net income basis;

                                      44

<PAGE>

    .   you are an individual, you hold the common stock or preferred stock as
        a capital asset, you are present in the United States for 183 or more
        days in the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions
        exist; or

    .   we are or have been a United States real property holding corporation
        for federal income tax purposes and certain other conditions are met.

     If you are a corporate United States alien holder, effectively connected
gains that you recognize may also, under certain circumstances, be subject to
an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or at a lower rate if you are
eligible for the benefits of an income tax treaty that provides for a lower
rate.

     We have not been, are not and do not anticipate becoming a United States
real property holding corporation for United States federal income tax purposes.

Federal Estate Taxes

     Common stock or preferred stock held by a United States alien holder at
the time of death will be included in the holder's gross estate for United
States federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty
provides otherwise.

Withholdable Payments to Foreign Financial Entities and Other Foreign Entities

     A 30% withholding tax will be imposed on certain payments that are made to
certain foreign financial institutions, investment funds and other non-U.S.
persons that fail to comply with information reporting requirements in respect
of their direct and indirect United States shareholders and/or United States
accountholders. Such payments would include U.S.-source dividends and the gross
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of stock that can produce
U.S.-source dividends. Under administrative guidance and proposed regulations,
withholding would only be made on payments of interest and dividends made on or
after January 1, 2014, and to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other
disposition of our common stock or preferred stock made on or after January 1,
2015.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

     United States Holders.  In general, if you are a non-corporate United
States holder, dividend payments, or other taxable distributions, made on your
common stock or preferred stock, as well as the payment of the proceeds from
the sale, repurchase or redemption of your common stock or preferred stock that
are made within the United States will be subject to information reporting
requirements. Additionally, backup withholding will apply to such payments if
you are a non-corporate United States holder and you:

    .   fail to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number;

    .   are notified by the United States Internal Revenue Service that you
        have failed to report all interest or dividends required to be shown on
        your federal income tax returns; or

    .   in certain circumstances, fail to comply with applicable certification
        requirements.

     If you sell your common stock or preferred stock outside the United States
through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker, and the sales proceeds are paid
to you outside the United States, then U.S. backup withholding and information
reporting requirements generally will not apply to that payment. However, U.S.
information reporting will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if that
payment is made outside the United States, if you sell your common stock or
preferred stock through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is:

    .   a United States person;

    .   a controlled foreign corporation for United States tax purposes;

                                      45

<PAGE>

    .   a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income is effectively
        connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business for a
        specified three-year period; or

    .   a foreign partnership, if at any time during its tax year:

        .   one or more of its partners are United States persons, as defined
            in U.S. Treasury regulations, who in the aggregate hold more than
            50% of the income or capital interest in the partnership; or

        .   such foreign partnership is engaged in the conduct of a United
            States trade or business.

     Backup withholding will apply if the sale is subject to information
reporting and the broker has actual knowledge that you are a United States
person.

     You generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the U.S.
backup withholding rules that exceed your income tax liability by filing a
refund claim with the United States Internal Revenue Service.

     United States Alien Holders.  If you are a United States alien holder, you
are generally exempt from backup withholding and information reporting
requirements with respect to:

    .   dividend payments; and

    .   the payment of the proceeds from the sale of common stock or preferred
        stock effected at a United States office of a broker;

as long as the income associated with such payments is otherwise exempt from
United States federal income tax, and:

    .   the payor or broker does not have actual knowledge or reason to know
        that you are a United States person and you have furnished to the payor
        or broker:

        .   a valid Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or an acceptable
            substitute form upon which you certify, under penalties of perjury,
            that you are not a United States person; or

        .   other documentation upon which it may rely to treat the payments as
            made to a non-United States person that is, for United States
            federal income tax purposes, the beneficial owner of the payments
            in accordance with U.S. Treasury regulations; or

    .   you otherwise establish an exemption.

     Payment of the proceeds from the sale of common stock or preferred stock
effected at a foreign office of a broker generally will not be subject to
information reporting or backup withholding. However, a sale of common stock or
preferred stock that is effected at a foreign office of a broker will be
subject to information reporting and backup withholding if:

    .   the proceeds are transferred to an account maintained by you in the
        United States;

    .   the payment of proceeds or the confirmation of the sale is mailed to
        you at a United States address; or

    .   the sale has some other specified connection with the United States as
        provided in U.S. Treasury regulations;

unless the broker does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are
a United States person and the documentation requirements described above are
met or you otherwise establish an exemption.

                                      46

<PAGE>

     In addition, a sale of common stock or preferred stock will be subject to
information reporting if it is effected at a foreign office of a broker that is:

    .   a United States person;

    .   a controlled foreign corporation for United States tax purposes;

    .   a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income is effectively
        connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business for a
        specified three-year period; or

    .   a foreign partnership, if at any time during its tax year:

        .   one or more of its partners are United States persons, as defined
            in U.S. Treasury regulations, who in the aggregate hold more than
            50% of the income or capital interest in the partnership; or

        .   such foreign partnership is engaged in the conduct of a United
            States trade or business;

unless the broker does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are
a United States person and the documentation requirements described above are
met or you otherwise establish an exemption. Backup withholding will apply if
the sale is subject to information reporting and the broker has actual
knowledge that you are a United States person that is, for United States
federal income tax purposes, the beneficial owner of the payments.

     You generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules that exceed your income tax liability by filing a refund
claim with the United States Internal Revenue Service.

                    EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT

     A fiduciary of a pension, profit-sharing or other employee benefit plan
governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(ERISA) (each, a Plan), should consider the fiduciary standards of ERISA in
the context of the Plan's particular circumstances before authorizing an
investment in the securities offered hereunder. Among other factors, the
fiduciary should consider whether the investment would satisfy the prudence and
diversification requirements of ERISA and would be consistent with the
documents and instruments governing the Plan, and whether the investment would
involve a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the U.S. Internal Revenue Code,
as amended (the Code).

     Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Plans that are
subject to Title I of ERISA and plans described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the
Code (including, without limitation, retirement accounts, Keogh plans and any
other plans that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code (also Plans)), from
engaging in certain transactions involving plan assets with persons who are
parties in interest under ERISA or disqualified persons under the Code with
respect to the Plan. A violation of these prohibited transaction rules may
result in excise tax or other liabilities under ERISA or the Code for those
persons, unless exemptive relief is available under an applicable statutory,
regulatory or administrative exemption. Employee benefit plans that are
governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans
(as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in
Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) (Non-ERISA Arrangements) are not subject to the
requirements of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but may be
subject to similar provisions under applicable federal, state, local, non-U.S.
or other laws (Similar Laws).

     The acquisition of the securities that we may offer by a Plan or any
entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of any Plan's
investment in the entity (a Plan Asset Entity) with respect to which we or
certain of our affiliates is or becomes a party in interest or disqualified
person may result in a prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code, unless those securities are acquired pursuant to an applicable
exemption. AIG, directly or through its affiliates, may be considered a party"
"17464","in interest or a disqualified person to a large number of Plans. A purchase
of offered securities by any such Plan may constitute or result in a prohibited
transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the offered
securities are acquired pursuant to and in accordance with an applicable
exemption. The U.S. Department of Labor has issued five prohibited transaction
class exemptions, or PTCEs, that may provide exemptive relief if required for
direct or indirect prohibited transactions that may arise from the purchase or
holding of a security offered hereunder. These exemptions are PTCE 84-14 (for
certain transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset
managers), PTCE 90-1 (for certain transactions involving insurance company
pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (for certain transactions involving bank
collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (for transactions involving certain
insurance company general accounts), and PTCE 96-23 (for transactions managed
by in-house asset managers). In addition, ERISA Section 408(b)(17) and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide an exemption for the purchase and sale
of the securities offered hereby, provided that neither AIG nor any of its
affiliates have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render
any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Plan involved in the
transaction, and provided further that the Plan pays no more and receives no
less than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction (the
service provider exemption). There can be no assurance that all of the
conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. The assets of a Plan may
include the assets held in the general account of an insurance company that are
deemed to be plan assets under ERISA.

     Any purchaser or holder of any security offered hereunder or any interest
therein will be deemed to have represented by its purchase and holding of the
security that either (1) it is not a Plan, a Plan Asset Entity or a Non-ERISA
Arrangement and is not purchasing the security on behalf of or with the assets
of any Plan, a Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement or (2) the purchase
and holding of the security will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

     Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed
upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is important
that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the

                                      48

<PAGE>

securities offered hereunder on behalf of or with the assets of any Plan, a
Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement consult with their counsel regarding
the availability of exemptive relief under any of the PTCEs listed above, the
service provider exemption or the potential consequences of any purchase or
holding under Similar Laws, as applicable. Purchasers of the securities offered
hereunder have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and
holding of the securities do not violate the fiduciary or prohibited
transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or any similar provisions of Similar
Laws. The sale of any security offered hereunder to a Plan, Plan Asset Entity
or Non-ERISA Arrangement is in no respect a representation by us or any of our
affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal
requirements with respect to investments by any such Plans, Plan Asset Entities
or Non-ERISA Arrangements generally or any particular Plan, Plan Asset Entity
or Non-ERISA Arrangement or that such investment is appropriate for such Plans,
Plan Asset Entities or Non-ERISA Arrangements generally or any particular Plan,
Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement.

                          FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, including the
documents incorporated by reference herein and therein, contain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. These
statements are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for forward-looking"
"17466","statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Words such as expect(s), feel(s), believe(s), will, may,
anticipate(s), intend, estimate, project and similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not
historical in nature. These statements include, but are not limited to,
financial projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions;
statements regarding plans, objectives and expectations with respect to future
operations, products and services; and statements regarding future performance.
Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which
are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control, that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or
projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. These risks and
uncertainties include: those discussed under Risk Factors in this prospectus
supplement and those identified in our public filings with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, or SEC; increased government participation in, or
regulation or taxation of health benefits and managed care operations,
including, but not limited to, the impact of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of
2010; trends in health care costs and utilization rates; our ability to secure
sufficient premium rates including regulatory approval for and implementation
of such rates; our ability to contract with providers consistent with past
practice; our ability to integrate and achieve expected synergies and operating
efficiencies in the AMERIGROUP Corporation acquisition within the expected
timeframe or at all, as such integration may be more difficult, time consuming
or costly than expected, revenues following the transaction may be lower than
expected and operating costs, customer loss and business disruption, including,
without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees,
customers, clients and suppliers, may be greater than expected following the
transaction; competitor pricing below market trends of increasing costs;
reduced enrollment, as well as a negative change in our health care product
mix; risks and uncertainties regarding Medicare and Medicaid programs,
including those related to non-compliance with the complex regulations imposed
thereon and funding risks with respect to revenue received from participation
therein; a downgrade in our financial strength ratings; litigation and
investigations targeted at our industry and our ability to resolve litigation
and investigations within estimates; medical malpractice or professional
liability claims or other risks related to health care services provided by our
subsidiaries; risks inherent in selling health care products in the consumer
retail market; our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock and pay
dividends on our common stock due to the adequacy of our cash flow and earnings
and other considerations; non-compliance by any party with the Express Scripts,
Inc. pharmacy benefit management services agreement, which could result in
financial penalties, our inability to meet customer demands, and sanctions
imposed by governmental entities, including the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services; events that result in negative publicity for us or the
health benefits industry; failure to effectively maintain and modernize our
information systems and e-business organization and to maintain good
relationships with third party vendors for information system resources; events
that may negatively affect our licenses with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield
Association; possible impairment of the value of our intangible assets if
future results do not adequately support goodwill and other intangible assets;
intense competition to attract and retain employees; unauthorized disclosure of
member sensitive or confidential information; changes in the economic and
market conditions, as well as regulations that may negatively affect our
investment portfolios and liquidity; possible restrictions in the payment of
dividends by our subsidiaries and increases in required minimum levels of
capital and the potential negative effect from our substantial amount of
outstanding indebtedness; general risks associated with mergers and
acquisitions; various laws and provisions in our governing documents that may
prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations; future public health
epidemics and catastrophes; and general economic downturns. Readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements that
speak only as of the date hereof. Except to the extent otherwise required by
federal securities law, we do not undertake any obligation to republish revised
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date
hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Readers are also
urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures in our SEC
reports.

The Tender Offer

Concurrently with this offering, we intend to commence cash tender offers for
up to $600 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes (subject
to increase), in each case at a purchase price determined in accordance with
the procedures of a modified Dutch Auction.

The offers (the Offers, and each an Offer) will comprise:

..  an Offer (the First Tranche Dutch Auction Offer) to purchase up to $300
   million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5.875% Notes due 2017
   and 7.000% Notes due 2019 (the First Tranche Dutch Auction Notes); and

..  an Offer (the Second Tranche Dutch Auction Offer) to purchase up to $300
   million aggregate principal amount of our 5.950% Notes due 2034, 5.850%
   Notes due 2036, 6.375% Notes due 2037, and 5.800%

                                      S-1

<PAGE>

   Notes due 2040 (the Second Tranche Dutch Notes and, together with the
   First Tranche Dutch Auction Notes, the Tender Notes).

The consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of Tender Notes validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City Time
on August 12, 2013 (the Early Tender Time) and accepted for purchase by us
(subject to prorationing) will be determined by reference to a spread over the
yield based on the bid-side price of an applicable Reference U.S. Treasury
security, as calculated by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated
and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., the dealer managers, as of 11:00 a.m. New
York City time, on August 12, 2013. The consideration payable on the Tender
Notes includes an early tender premium of $30 per $1,000 principal amount of
Tender Notes accepted for purchase. The funds required to pay for those Tender
Notes accepted for purchase in the Offers, including accrued and unpaid
interest on such Tender Notes, is estimated to be approximately $730 million,
plus related fees and expenses, assuming that all Tender Notes are validly
tendered at or prior to the applicable Early Tender Time, all Tender Notes
tendered in the Offers are tendered at the applicable midpoint of an acceptance
bid spread range specified for the Offers in the Offer documents, and the price
is determined and the Tender Notes are settled on the dates contemplated in the
Offer documents.

Holders of Tender Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time but before 11:59
p.m., New York City time, on August 26, 2013 (as may be extended, the
Expiration Time) and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers will not
receive the early tender premium. In addition, all holders of Tender Notes
accepted for purchase pursuant to the applicable Offer will receive accrued and
unpaid interest on their Tender Notes from the last interest payment date to
the applicable settlement date. No tenders submitted after the Expiration Time
will be valid.

Each Offer is conditioned upon the satisfaction of certain conditions,
including the closing and issuance of the notes offered hereby, which
conditions may be waived with respect to either Offer at our option. We cannot
assure you that either Offer will be consummated in accordance with its terms,
or at all. This offering is not conditioned upon the consummation of either
Offer. If the Offers are completed as planned, there would be a pre-tax charge
associated with the transactions that will vary depending on the pricing and
the level of participation in the Offers, which charge may be significant. The
amount of any such charge and its impact on our results cannot be determined at
this time.

                              2018 notes and the 2044 notes in full, upon the
                              occurrence of both (1) a change of control of us
                              and (2) a downgrade of the notes below an
                              investment grade rating by each of Moody's
                              Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor's
                              Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings, Inc. within a
                              specified period, we will be required to make an
                              offer to purchase all of the notes at a price in
                              cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of
                              such notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest
                              to the date of repurchase. See Description of"
"17469","                              the Notes--Repurchase Upon a Change of Control.

Ranking.....................  The notes will be our unsecured and
                              unsubordinated obligations and will rank equally
                              with all of our current and future unsecured and
                              unsubordinated indebtedness, including any
                              borrowings under our senior credit facility, and
                              senior to all of our future subordinated debt.
                              The notes will effectively rank junior to any of
                              our future secured indebtedness to the extent of
                              the value of the assets securing such
                              indebtedness. The notes will not be guaranteed by
                              any of our subsidiaries and will therefore be
                              effectively subordinated to all existing and
                              future liabilities of our subsidiaries. The
                              indenture does not restrict our ability or the
                              ability of our subsidiaries to incur other
                              indebtedness. As of June 30, 2013, we had
                              approximately $14.8 billion of indebtedness
                              outstanding, of which approximately $0.4 billion
                              consisted of indebtedness of our subsidiaries and
                              approximately $0.4 billion was secured debt.

  Notes.....................  The notes of each series will initially be
                              represented by one or more global notes which
                              will be deposited with a custodian for, and
                              registered in the name of a nominee of The
                              Depository Trust Company, or DTC. Indirect
                              holders trading their beneficial interests in the
                              global notes through DTC must trade in DTC's
                              same-day funds settlement system and pay in
                              immediately available funds. The notes may only
                              be withdrawn from DTC in the limited situations
                              described in the accompanying prospectus in the
                              section entitled Description of the Debt"
"17470","                              Securities--Global Notes, Delivery and Form. The
                              notes of each series will be issued in minimum
                              denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of
                              $1,000 in excess of $2,000.

Use of Proceeds.............  The net proceeds of this offering, after
                              deducting the underwriting discounts and
                              estimated offering expenses payable by us, will
                              be approximately $1.234 billion. We will use the
                              net proceeds to fund the purchase price of the
                              Tender Notes tendered and accepted by us for
                              purchase pursuant to the Offers, including the
                              payment of accrued interest and any applicable
                              early tender premiums. We will use the remaining
                              net proceeds from this offering for general
                              corporate purposes, including repurchases of
                              other outstanding indebtedness. See Use of"

Further Issues..............  We may from time to time, without the consent of
                              the holders of the notes, create and issue
                              additional securities having substantially the
                              same terms and conditions, other than the
                              offering price, original interest accrual date
                              and/or the initial interest payment date, as the
                              2018 notes or the 2044 notes, in each case, so
                              that such issue shall be consolidated and form a
                              single series with the outstanding 2018 notes or

<PAGE>

                                 RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the risk
factors described in and incorporated by reference into this prospectus
supplement and the accompanying prospectus, as well as all of the other
information in, and incorporated by reference into, this prospectus supplement
and the accompanying prospectus before you decide to buy the notes. If any of
the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of
operations could suffer. In that event, we may be unable to meet our
obligations under the notes and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Risks Relating to the Notes

As of June 30, 2013, we had indebtedness outstanding of approximately $14.8
billion and expect to incur additional indebtedness in the future. As a holding
company, we will not be able to repay our indebtedness except through dividends
from subsidiaries, some of which are restricted in their ability to pay such
dividends under applicable insurance law and undertakings. Such indebtedness
could also adversely affect our ability to pursue desirable business
opportunities.

As of June 30, 2013, we had indebtedness outstanding of approximately $14.8
billion and had available borrowing capacity of approximately $2.0 billion
under our senior revolving credit facility, which expires on September 29,
2016. We also expect to incur additional indebtedness in the future. The terms
of the indenture under which the notes are issued do not prohibit us or our
subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness. Our debt service
obligations will require us to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest
and principal on debt instead of for other corporate purposes, including
funding future expansion. If our cash flow and capital resources are
insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to seek
extraordinary dividends from our subsidiaries, sell assets, seek additional
equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. However, these measures might
be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service
obligations.

As a holding company, we have no operations and are dependent on dividends from
our subsidiaries for cash to fund our debt service and other corporate needs.
Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities. Furthermore, our subsidiaries are
not obligated to make funds available to us, and creditors of our subsidiaries
will have a superior claim to certain of our subsidiaries' assets. State
insurance laws restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay
dividends, and in some states we have made special undertakings that may limit
the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our
subsidiaries' ability to make any payments to us will also depend on their
earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, business and tax considerations and
other legal restrictions. We cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be
able to pay dividends or otherwise contribute or distribute funds to us in an
amount sufficient to pay the principal of or interest on the indebtedness owed
by us. Indebtedness could also limit our ability to pursue desirable business
opportunities, and may affect our ability to maintain an investment grade
rating for our indebtedness.

We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to restrictive
covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. Our
breach or failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in a
default under our credit agreements. If we default under our credit agreements,
the lenders could cease to make further extensions of credit or cause all of
our outstanding debt obligations under our credit agreements to become
immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If the
indebtedness under the notes or our credit agreements is accelerated, we may be
unable to repay or finance the amounts due.

The notes are not secured by any of our assets and any secured creditors would
have a prior claim on our assets.

The notes are not secured by any of our assets. The terms of the indenture
permit us to incur secured debt. If we become insolvent or are liquidated, or
if payment under any of the agreements governing our secured debt is
accelerated, the lenders under our secured debt agreements will be entitled to
exercise the remedies available to a secured lender under applicable law and
pursuant to agreements governing that debt. Accordingly, the lenders

                                      S-5

<PAGE>

will have a prior claim on our assets. In that event, because the notes are not
secured by any of our assets, it is possible that there will be no assets
remaining from which claims of the holders of notes can be satisfied or, if any
assets remain, the remaining assets might be insufficient to satisfy those
claims in full. As of June 30, 2013, we had approximately $0.4 billion of
secured debt outstanding.

The notes are effectively subordinated to the indebtedness of our subsidiaries.

Because we operate as a holding company, our right to participate in any
distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon that subsidiary's dissolution,
winding-up, liquidation, reorganization or otherwise (and thus the ability of
the holders of the notes to participate indirectly from the distribution) is
subject to the prior claims of the creditors of that subsidiary, except to the
extent that we are a creditor of the subsidiary and our claims are recognized.
Therefore, the notes are effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other
obligations of our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities
and have no obligations to pay, or make funds available for the payment of, any
amounts due on the notes. The indenture governing the notes does not prohibit
or limit the incurrence of indebtedness and other liabilities by us or our
subsidiaries. The incurrence of additional indebtedness and other liabilities
by us or our subsidiaries could adversely affect our ability to pay obligations
on the notes. As of June 30, 2013, we had approximately $14.8 billion of
indebtedness outstanding, of which approximately $0.4 billion consisted of
indebtedness of our subsidiaries.

We may not be able to satisfy our obligations to repurchase the notes upon the
occurrence of both a change of control and downgrades of the notes.

Unless we have exercised our right to redeem the 2018 notes and the 2044 notes
in full, upon the occurrence of both (1) a change of control of us and (2) a
downgrade of the notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody's
Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings,
Inc. within a specified period, which we refer to as a change of control
triggering event, we will be required to make an offer to purchase all of the
2018 notes and the 2044 notes at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount of the 2018 notes and the 2044 notes, plus any accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of repurchase. The source of funds for any purchase of our
debt securities, including the notes, will be our available cash or cash
generated from our operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of
assets or sales of equity. We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a
change of control triggering event because we may not have sufficient financial
resources to purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered upon a
change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due, if
any. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such
purchases, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain financing
on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to repurchase the notes
may be limited by applicable law. See Description of the Notes--Repurchase"
"17472","Upon a Change of Control. As a result of our potential obligations to
repurchase the notes, we may have to avoid certain change of control
transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us and our shareholders.

                                USE OF PROCEEDS

We estimate that the net proceeds from the offering of the notes will be
approximately $1.234 billion, after deducting the underwriting discounts and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use a portion of the
net proceeds of this offering to fund the purchase price of the Tender Notes
tendered and accepted by us for purchase pursuant to the Offers, including the
payment of accrued interest and any applicable early tender premiums. See
Prospectus Supplement Summary--Recent Developments--The Tender Offer.

If $600 million aggregate principal amount of the Tender Notes are validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Tender Offer prior to the
Early Tender Date, we estimate that the total amount of funds required to
purchase the Tender Notes, including payment of any applicable early tender
premium, and to pay all accrued and unpaid interest on such Tender Notes would
be approximately $730 million. The Tender Offer is conditioned upon the
satisfaction of certain conditions, including our receipt of funds sufficient
to pay the aggregate consideration payable with respect to the Tender Notes.

                           DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES

The Notes Will be Issued under the Indenture

We will issue $650,000,000 initial aggregate principal amount of 2.300% notes
due 2018 and $600,000,000 initial aggregate principal amount of 5.100% notes
due 2044. The notes will be issued under the senior note indenture dated as of
January 10, 2006 between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.
(formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), as trustee. The
trustee has two main roles. First, the trustee can enforce your rights against
us if we default; however, there are some limitations on the extent to which
the trustee acts on your behalf. Second, the trustee performs administrative
functions for us, such as sending you interest payments (as our paying agent),
transferring your notes to a new buyer if you sell them (as our registrar) and
sending you notices.

The indenture and the notes contain the full legal text of the matters
described in this section. We have filed a copy of the indenture with the SEC
as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 11, 2006. The
indenture and the notes are governed by New York law.

Because this section is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the
notes and the indenture. This description is subject to, and qualified in its
entirety by, all the provisions of the indenture, including definitions of
certain terms used in the indenture. For example, in this section we use
capitalized words to signify defined terms that have been given special meaning
in the indenture. We describe the meaning for only the more important terms. We
urge you to read the indenture and the notes because they, and not this
description, define your rights as a holder of the notes.

Terms of the Notes

The 2018 notes will mature on July 15, 2018 and the 2044 notes will mature on
January 15, 2044. The notes will be our unsecured and unsubordinated
obligations and will rank equally with all of our other unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. No sinking fund will
be provided with respect to the notes. The notes will not be convertible or
exchangeable for other securities or property. No additional amounts will be
payable with respect to the notes.

Each series of notes will be issued in fully registered form only, in minimum
denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000.
Each series of notes will be issued in the form of one or more Global
Securities, without coupons, which will be deposited initially with, or on
behalf of, DTC.

We will pay interest on the notes from August 6, 2013 or from the most recent
Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for,
semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing
January 15, 2014 until the principal is paid or made available for payment.
Interest will be paid to the persons in whose names the notes are registered at
the close of business on January 1 or July 1 (whether or not a Business Day),
as the case may be, next preceding the relevant Interest Payment Date. Interest
will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

If any Interest Payment Date or date of maturity of principal of the notes
falls on a day that is not a Business Day, then payment of interest or
principal may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force
and effect as if made on the nominal date of maturity, and no interest will
accrue for the period after such nominal date.

Optional Redemption

We will have the right to redeem the notes of any series, in whole at any time
or in part from time to time, at our option, on at least 30 days' but no more
than 60 days' prior written notice mailed to the registered holders of the
notes to be redeemed. Upon redemption of the notes, we will pay a redemption
price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to
be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the

                                     S-10

<PAGE>

Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) of the applicable notes to be
redeemed, discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming
a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30 day months) at the Treasury Rate (as
defined below) plus 15 basis points in the case of the 2018 notes and 25 basis
points in the case of the 2044 notes, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid
interest on the applicable notes to the redemption date.

Treasury Rate means, for any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the
semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity, computed by us as of the second
Business Day immediately preceding that redemption date, of the applicable
Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for such Comparable Treasury Issue
(expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the applicable
Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date.

Comparable Treasury Issue means the United States Treasury security selected
by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the
remaining term of the applicable notes to be redeemed that would be utilized,
at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice,
in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to
the remaining term of the applicable notes to be redeemed.

Comparable Treasury Price means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the
average of the bid and asked prices for the applicable Comparable Treasury
Issue, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, on the
third Business Day preceding such redemption date, as contained in the daily
statistical release, or any successor release, published by the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York and designated Composite 3:30 p.m. Quotations for U.S."
"17473","Government Securities or (2) if the release, or any successor release, is not
published or does not contain these prices on that Business Day, (a) the
average of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date,
after excluding the highest and lowest of the Reference Treasury Dealer
Quotations, or (b) if we obtain fewer than four Reference Treasury Dealer
Quotations, the average of all of such quotations.

Independent Investment Banker means the Reference Treasury Dealer appointed
by us.

Reference Treasury Dealer means each of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and their respective successors, or if at any
time any of the above is not a primary U.S. Government securities dealer, any
other nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by us that is a
primary U.S. Government securities dealer, as well as four other nationally
recognized investment banking firms selected by us that are primary U.S.
Government securities dealers.

Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations means, with respect to each Reference
Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by us, of
the bid and asked prices for the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue
(expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in
writing to us by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.

Remaining Scheduled Payments means, with respect to each note to be redeemed,
the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon
that would be due after the related redemption date for such redemption;
provided, however, that, if such redemption date is not an interest payment
date with respect to such note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled
interest payment thereon will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued
thereon to such redemption date.

If less than all the notes of any series are to be redeemed, the notes of such
series to be redeemed shall be selected by the trustee by such method as the
trustee deems fair and appropriate. In the case of notes in global form, the
notes to be redeemed will be selected in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC. Unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and
after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the notes or
portions thereof called for redemption.

Except as described above, the notes will not be redeemable by us prior to
maturity.

                                     S-11

<PAGE>

Repurchase Upon a Change of Control

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless we have exercised our
right to redeem the 2018 notes and the 2044 notes in full, as described above,
we will make an offer to each holder (the Change of Control Offer) to
repurchase any and all (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in
excess of $2,000) of such holder's 2018 notes and 2044 notes at a repurchase
price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to the date of purchase (the
Change of Control Payment). Within 30 days following any Change of Control
Triggering Event, we will be required to mail a notice to holders of notes
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of
Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the notes on the date
specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no
later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the Change of Control"
"17474","Payment Date), pursuant to the procedures required by the notes and described
in such notice. We must comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the
extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict
with the Change of Control repurchase provisions of the notes, we will be
required to comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will
not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the Change of Control
repurchase provisions of the notes by virtue of such conflicts.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, we will be required, to the extent
lawful, to:

..  accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered pursuant
   to the Change of Control Offer;

..  deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control
   Payment in respect of all notes or portions of notes properly tendered; and

..  deliver or cause to be delivered to the trustee the notes properly accepted,
   together with an officer's certificate stating the principal amount of notes
   or portions of notes being purchased.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or
indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or"
"17475","substantially all of the properties or assets of WellPoint and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase substantially all, there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the applicability
of the requirement that we offer to repurchase the notes as a result of a sale,
lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets
of WellPoint and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person (as
defined in the indenture) or group may be uncertain.

For purposes of the foregoing discussion of the applicable Change of Control
provisions, the following definitions are applicable:

Below Investment Grade Rating Event means the notes are rated below an
Investment Grade Rating by each of the Rating Agencies (as defined below) on
any date from the date of the public notice of an arrangement that could
reasonably be expected to result in a Change of Control until the end of the
60-day period following public notice of the occurrence of the Change of
Control (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the
notes is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade by any
of the Rating Agencies); provided, however, that a Below Investment Grade
Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating
will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of
Control (and thus will not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Rating Event for
purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the rating
agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would
otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the trustee in
writing at our request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part,
of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in
respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable
Change of Control has occurred at the time of the Below Investment Grade Rating
Event).

                                     S-12

<PAGE>

Change of Control means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) direct or
indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of
merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or
substantially all of the properties or assets of WellPoint and its subsidiaries
taken as a whole to any person (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of
the Exchange Act) other than to WellPoint or one of its subsidiaries; (2) the
consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or
consolidation) the result of which is that any person (as that term is used
in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) becomes the beneficial owner, directly
or indirectly, of more than 50% of the then outstanding number of shares of
WellPoint's voting stock; or (3) the first day on which a majority of the
members of WellPoint's Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors;
provided, however, that a transaction will not be deemed to involve a Change of
Control if we become a wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company and the
holders of the voting stock of such holding company immediately following that
transaction are substantially the same as the holders of our voting stock
immediately prior to that transaction. For purposes of this definition, voting"
"17476","stock means capital stock of any class or kind the holders of which are
ordinarily, in the absence of contingencies, entitled to vote for the election
of directors (or persons performing similar functions) of WellPoint, even if
the right to vote has been suspended by the happening of such a contingency.

Change of Control Triggering Event means the occurrence of both a Change of
Control and a Below Investment Grade Rating Event.

Continuing Directors means, as of any date of determination, any member of
the Board of Directors of WellPoint who (1) was a member of the Board of
Directors of WellPoint on the date of the issuance of the notes; or (2) was
nominated for election or elected to the Board of Directors of WellPoint with
the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of such
Board of Directors of WellPoint at the time of such nomination or election
(either by specific vote or by approval of WellPoint's proxy statement in which
such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without
objection to such nomination).

Fitch means Fitch Ratings, Inc.

Investment Grade Rating means a rating by Moody's equal to or higher than
Baa3 (or the equivalent under a successor rating category of Moody's), a rating
by S&P equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent under any successor
rating category of S&P) or a rating by Fitch equal to or higher than BBB- (or
the equivalent under any successor rating category of Fitch), or a rating by a
replacement Rating Agency, if applicable, substantially equivalent to the
foregoing ratings or higher.

Moody's means Moody's Investors Service, Inc.

Rating Agencies means (1) Moody's, S&P and Fitch; and (2) if any or all of
Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceases to rate the notes or fails to make a rating of the
notes publicly available for reasons outside of our control, a nationally"
"17477","recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of
Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act, selected by us (as certified
by a resolution of our Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for any of
Moody's, S&P or Fitch, or all of them, as the case may be.

S&P means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill

We May Issue Other Series of Debt Securities

The indenture permits us to issue different series of debt securities from time
to time. The specific terms of each other series that we may issue in the
future may differ from those of the notes. The indenture does not limit the
aggregate amount of debt securities that may be issued under the indenture, nor
does it limit the number of other series or the aggregate amount of any
particular series. The 2018 notes will be limited initially to $650,000,000
aggregate principal amount and the 2044 notes will be limited initially to
$600,000,000 aggregate principal amount, but we may re-open any series of
notes at any time without the consent of the noteholders. We may issue

                                     S-13

<PAGE>

additional securities from time to time after this offering. The notes of any
series and any additional new notes at any time of such series subsequently
issued under the indenture would be treated as a single series for all purposes
under the indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase.

The indenture and the notes do not limit our ability to incur other debt or to
issue other securities. When we refer to a series of debt securities, we mean a
series, such as each of the series of notes we are offering by means of this
prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, issued under the
indenture. When we refer to the notes or these notes, we mean each series of
notes we are offering by means of this prospectus supplement and the
accompanying prospectus.

Defeasance

The notes may be defeased, at our option, through legal defeasance or covenant
defeasance as provided for in the indenture and as described in the
accompanying prospectus in the sections entitled Description of the Debt"
"17478","Securities--Defeasance and Description of the Debt Securities--Satisfaction"
"17479","and Discharge.

Book-Entry Notes

Each series of notes will be issued in the form of one or more Global
Securities in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons. Each
Global Security will be deposited with the trustee, as custodian for, and
registered in the name of, a nominee of DTC, as depository and will be held
through the book-entry system of DTC and its participants, including Euroclear
and Clearstream. See Description of the Debt Securities--Global Notes,"
"17480","Delivery and Form in the accompanying prospectus for a description of
registered Global Securities held in book entry form.

We will issue debt securities in definitive form in exchange for a Global Note
only in the following situations:

..  if the Depository is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as
   depository and a successor depository is not appointed by us within 120 days;

..  subject to DTC procedures, if we choose to issue definitive debt securities;
   or

..  if there is an Event of Default and there is a request from the Depository
   or any holder.

In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note will
be entitled to have debt securities equal in principal amount to that
beneficial interest registered in its name and will be entitled to physical
delivery of debt securities in definitive form. Debt securities in definitive
form will be issued in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000
in excess thereof and will be issued in registered form only, without coupons.
We will maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, one or more
offices or agencies where debt securities may be presented for payment and may
be transferred or exchanged. You will not be charged a fee for any transfer or
exchange of debt securities, but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

                UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

The following summary describes certain material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of ownership and disposition of the notes. This discussion applies
only to notes that are:

..  purchased by those initial holders who purchase notes in this offering at
   the issue price, which will equal the first price to the public (not
   including bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in
   the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) at which a
   substantial amount of the notes is sold for money; and

..  held as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code (as
   defined below).

This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be
relevant to a holder in light of the holder's particular circumstances or to
holders subject to special rules, such as:

..  certain financial institutions;

..  insurance companies;

..  dealers in securities;

..  traders in securities that elect a mark-to-market method of accounting;

..  persons holding notes as part of a hedge, straddle, integrated transaction
   or similar transaction;

..  U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S.
   dollar;

..  partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal
   income tax purposes;

..  tax-exempt entities; or

..  persons subject to the alternative minimum tax.

If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes holds notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will
generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. Partnerships holding notes and partners in such partnerships
should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax
consequences to them of holding and disposing of the notes.

This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
Code), administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary
and proposed Treasury Regulations, changes to any of which subsequent to the
date of this prospectus supplement may affect the tax consequences described
herein. This summary is not binding on the courts or the Internal Revenue
Service (the IRS), and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not
challenge one or more of the tax consequences described herein, and we have not
obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, a ruling from the IRS with respect to the
U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning or disposing of the
notes. This discussion is not intended to be used, and cannot be used, for
purpose of avoiding penalties. Persons considering the purchase of notes are
urged to consult their tax advisors with regard to the application of the U.S.
federal income tax laws to their particular situations as well as any tax
consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing
jurisdiction.

This discussion does not address the effect of any federal taxes other than
income taxes (e.g., federal estate or gift taxes or the Medicare tax on certain
investment income) or any state, local or foreign taxes.

Optional redemption and repurchase upon a change in control

We intend to take the position that the possibility of the payment of
additional amounts above the principal amount of the notes described in
Description of the Notes--Optional Redemption, and Description of the"
"17481","Notes--Repurchase Upon a Change in Control is remote and therefore will not
cause the notes to be considered contingent payment debt instruments under
applicable Treasury Regulations. Our position is binding on you

                                     S-15

<PAGE>

unless you disclose that you are taking a contrary position in the manner
required by applicable Treasury Regulations. Our position is not, however,
binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to challenge this position, you might
be required to use the accrual method, even if you were otherwise a cash method
taxpayer, to accrue income on the notes in excess of the stated interest on the
notes, and to treat as ordinary income rather than capital gain any income that
you realize on the taxable disposition of a note. The remainder of this
discussion assumes that the notes will not be considered contingent payment
debt instruments.

Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders

As used herein, the term U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of a note that
is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

..  an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

..  a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal
   income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United
   States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia;

..  an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation
   regardless of its source; or

..  a trust, if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary
   supervision over administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons
   have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (b) the
   trust was in existence on August 20, 1996 and has a valid election to be
   treated as a U.S. person in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury
   Regulations.

The term U.S. Holder also includes certain former citizens and residents of
the United States.

Payments of interest

It is anticipated, and the following discussion assumes, that the notes will be
issued with no more than a de minimis amount of original issue discount.
Interest payable on a note will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary
interest income at the time it accrues or is received in accordance with the
U.S. Holder's method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Sale, exchange or other disposition of the notes

Upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of a note, a U.S. Holder
will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount
realized on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition and the U.S.
Holder's tax basis in the note (generally the price paid by the U.S. Holder to
purchase the note). For these purposes, the amount realized does not include an
amount equal to the accrued but unpaid interest on the note, which will be
treated as interest as described under Payments of interest above.

Gain or loss realized on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of a
note will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain
or loss if at the time of the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition the
note has been held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. Long-term capital
gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals)
generally are subject to U.S. federal income taxation at preferential rates.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations under the Code.

Backup withholding and information reporting

Information returns will be filed with the IRS in connection with payments on
the notes and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the notes to
certain non-corporate U.S. Holders. A U.S. Holder will be subject to U.S.
backup withholding on these payments if the U.S. Holder fails to provide its
taxpayer identification number to the paying agent and comply with certain
certification procedures or otherwise establish an exemption from backup
withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any
backup withholding from a

                                     S-16

<PAGE>

payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder's
U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund,
provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders

As used herein, the term Non-U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of a note
that is not a U.S. Holder.

Payments of interest

Subject to the discussions below concerning backup withholding and new
legislation relating to foreign accounts, payments of interest on the notes by
us or any paying agent to any Non-U.S. Holder that is not effectively connected
with the Non-U.S. Holder's conduct of a trade or business within the United
States will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax, provided
that:

..  the Non-U.S. Holder does not own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of
   the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to
   vote, and is not a controlled foreign corporation related, directly or
   indirectly, to us through stock ownership; and

..  the Non-U.S. Holder certifies on Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, under
   penalties of perjury, that it is not a United States person or holds its
   notes through various foreign intermediaries and satisfies the certification
   requirements of applicable Treasury Regulations.

In the event that a Non-U.S. Holder does not meet the foregoing requirements,
interest on the notes that is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S.
Holder's conduct of a trade or business within the United States will be
subject to the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax (or lower rate under an
applicable income tax treaty).

If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and
interest on the note is effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or
business, the Non-U.S. Holder will generally be taxed in the same manner as a
U.S. Holder (see --Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders above), subject to an
applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise. Such a Non-U.S. Holder will
be required to provide a properly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W8-ECI
in order to claim an exemption from withholding tax on interest. Non-U.S.
Holders whose interest derived from the notes may be effectively connected with
the conduct of a trade or business in the United States are urged to consult
their own tax advisors with respect to the U.S. tax consequences of the
ownership and disposition of notes, including the possible imposition of an
additional branch profits tax, currently at a rate of 30% (or lower rate under
an applicable income tax treaty), on Non-U.S. Holders that are corporations.

Sale, exchange or other disposition of the notes

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and new legislation relating
to foreign accounts below, U.S. federal income or withholding tax will not
apply to any gain that a Non-U.S. Holder realizes on the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note unless (i) that
gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the
United States by the Non-U.S. Holder and, if required by an applicable income
tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment or fixed base of
the Non-U.S. Holder or (ii) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present
in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more in
the taxable year of that disposition and other conditions are met. If clause
(i) applies, the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
the net gain derived from the disposition generally in the same manner as if
the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder, and if the Non-U.S. Holder is a
corporation, such Non-U.S. Holder may also be subject to a branch profits tax
equal to 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) as described above. If clause
(ii) applies, such Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to a flat 30% tax (or lower
applicable treaty rate) on the gain derived from the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition, which may be offset by
certain U.S. source capital losses, even though such holder is not considered a
resident of the United States.

                                     S-17

<PAGE>

Backup withholding and information reporting

Information returns will be filed with the IRS in connection with interest
payments on the notes. Copies of the information returns may also be made
available to the tax authorities in the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder
resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or applicable
tax information exchange agreement. In general, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be
subject to backup withholding or additional information reporting requirements
with respect to payments that we make to the Non-U.S. Holder on the notes,
provided that the withholding agent has received the certifications required to
claim the exemption from withholding tax on interest described above. Unless
the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certification procedures to establish that it
is not a United States person, information returns may be filed with the IRS in
connection with the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the notes and
the Non-U.S. Holder may be subject to U.S. backup withholding on payments on
the notes or on the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the notes
within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related financial
intermediaries. Compliance with the certification procedures required to claim
the exemption from withholding tax on interest described above will satisfy the
certification requirements necessary to avoid backup withholding as well.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup
withholding from a payment to a Non-U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit
against the Non-U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and
may entitle the Non-U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

We are offering the notes described in this prospectus supplement through a
number of underwriters. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Citigroup Global Markets
Inc. are the representatives of the underwriters. We have entered into a firm
commitment underwriting agreement with the representatives. Subject to the
terms and conditions of the underwriting agreement, we have agreed to sell to
the underwriters, and each underwriter has agreed to purchase, severally and
not jointly, the aggregate principal amount of notes listed next to its name in

</TABLE>

The underwriting agreement is subject to a number of terms and conditions and
provides that the underwriters must buy all of the notes if they buy any of
them. The underwriters will sell the notes to the public when and if the
underwriters buy the notes from us.

The underwriters have advised us that they propose to initially offer the notes
to the public for cash at the public offering prices set forth on the cover of
this prospectus supplement, and that they may offer the notes to certain
dealers at such price less concessions not in excess of 0.350% of the principal
amount of the 2018 notes and 0.500% of the principal amount of the 2044 notes.
The underwriters may allow, and such dealers may reallow, a concession not in
excess of 0.175% of the principal amount of the 2018 notes and 0.250% of the
principal amount of the 2044 notes to certain other dealers. After the public
offering of the notes, the public offering prices and other selling terms may
be changed. The offering of the notes by the underwriters is subject to receipt
and acceptance and subject to the underwriters' right to reject any order in
whole or in part.

We estimate that our share of the total expenses of the offering, excluding
underwriting discounts, will be approximately $3.3 million.

We have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against, or contribute to
payments that the underwriters may be required to make in respect of, certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

The notes are new issues of securities with no established trading market. The
notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or on any automated dealer
quotation system. The underwriters may make a market in each series of the
notes after completion of the offering, but will not be obligated to do so and
may discontinue any

                                     S-19

<PAGE>

market-making activities at any time without notice. No assurance can be given
as to the liquidity of the trading markets for the notes or that an active
public market for either series of the notes will develop. If active public
markets for the notes do not develop, the market prices and liquidity of the
notes may be adversely affected.

In connection with the offering of the notes, certain of the underwriters may
engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the prices
of the notes. Specifically, the underwriters may overallot in connection with
the offering, creating a short position. In addition, the underwriters may bid
for, and purchase, the notes in the open market to cover short positions or to
stabilize the prices of the notes. Any of these activities may stabilize or
maintain the market prices of the notes above independent market levels, but no
representation is made hereby of the magnitude of any effect that the
transactions described above may have on the market prices of the notes. The
underwriters will not be required to engage in these activities, and may engage
in these activities, and may end any of these activities, at any time without
notice.

The underwriters also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular
underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount
received by it because the representatives have repurchased notes sold by or
for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering
transactions.

We expect to deliver the notes against payment for the notes on or about August
6, 2013, the fifth business day following the date of the pricing of the notes.
Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally
are required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to a trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes on
the date of this prospectus supplement or the next succeeding business day will
be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed
settlement.

European Economic Area

In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has
implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a Relevant Member State), each
underwriter has represented and agreed that with effect from and including the
date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member
State (the Relevant Implementation Date) it has not made and will not make an
offer of Notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated by this
Prospectus Supplement and the accompanying Prospectus to the public in that
Relevant Member State other than:

(a)to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the
   Prospectus Directive;

(b)to fewer than 100 or, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the
   relevant provision of the 2010 PD Amending Directive, 150, natural or legal
   persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus
   Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive, subject to
   obtaining the prior consent of the relevant Dealer or Dealers nominated by
   the Issuer for any such offer; or

(c)in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus
   Directive,

provided that no such offer of Notes shall require the Issuer or any
underwriter to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus
Directive.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an offer of Notes to the"
"17482","public in relation to any Notes in any Relevant Member State means the
communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the
terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to
decide to purchase or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that
Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that
Member State, the expression Prospectus Directive means Directive 2003/71/EC
(and amendments thereto, including the 2010 PD Amending Directive, to the
extent implemented in the Relevant Member State), and includes any relevant
implementing measure in the Relevant Member State and the expression 2010 PD
Amending Directive means Directive 2010/73/EU.

(a)(i) it is a person whose ordinary activities involve it in acquiring,
   holding, managing or disposing of investments (as principal or agent) for
   the purposes of its business and (ii) it has not offered or sold and will
   not offer or sell the Notes other than to persons whose ordinary activities
   involve them in acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of investments (as
   principal or as agent) for the purposes of their businesses or who it is
   reasonable to expect will acquire, hold, manage or dispose of investments
   (as principal or agent) for the purposes of their businesses where the issue
   of the Notes would otherwise constitute a contravention of Section 19 of the
   FSMA by the Issuer; and

(b)it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only
   communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to
   engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA)
   received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in
   circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the
   Issuer.

Hong Kong

The notes may not be offered or sold by means of any document other than (i) in
circumstances which do not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning
of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.32, Laws of Hong Kong), or (ii) to
professional investors within the meaning of the Securities and Futures
Ordinance (Cap.571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder, or
(iii) in other circumstances which do not result in the document being a
prospectus within the meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.32, Laws of
Hong Kong), and no advertisement, invitation or document relating to the notes
may be issued or may be in the possession of any person for the purpose of

Japan

The securities have not been and will not be registered under the Securities
and Exchange Law of Japan (the Securities and Exchange Law) and each
underwriter has agreed that it will not offer or sell any securities, directly
or indirectly, in Japan or to, or for the benefit of, any resident of Japan
(which term as used herein means any person resident in Japan, including any
corporation or other entity organized under the laws of Japan), or to others
for re-offering or resale, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to a resident of
Japan, except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of,
and otherwise in compliance with, the Securities and Exchange Law and any other
applicable laws, regulations and ministerial guidelines of Japan.

Other Relationships

Certain of the underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in
the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the
ordinary course of business with us or our affiliates. They have received, or
may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these
transactions. Certain affiliates of underwriters are participants in our
revolving credit agreement.

In addition, certain underwriters or their affiliates hold positions in the
First Tranche Dutch Auction Notes and the Second Tranche Dutch Auction Notes
and therefore may receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering. In the
ordinary course of their business activities, the underwriters and their
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade
debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts
of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve
securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the underwriters or
their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge
their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management
policies. Typically, the underwriters and their affiliates would hedge such
exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of
credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities,
including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The
underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations
and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such
securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that
they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

regarding plans, objectives and expectations with respect to future operations,
products and services; and statements regarding future performance.
Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and
uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our
control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and
statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date hereof. You are also
urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us,
which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors that affect our
business, including the Risk Factors incorporated by reference herein and our
reports filed with the SEC from time to time. Except to the extent otherwise
required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake any obligation to
republish revised forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

                                USE OF PROCEEDS

   Unless we otherwise specify in the applicable prospectus supplement, the net
proceeds we receive from the sale of the securities offered by this prospectus
and the accompanying prospectus supplement will be used for general corporate
purposes. General corporate purposes may include but are not limited to the
repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries,
the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion or the repurchase
of shares of our common stock. The net proceeds may be invested temporarily or
applied to repay short-term debt until they are used for their stated purpose.

  RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES AND RATIO OF EARNINGS TO COMBINED FIXED
                     CHARGES AND PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS

   Our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and ratio of earnings to combined
fixed charges and preferred stock dividends for each of the five most recently
completed fiscal years and any required interim periods will each be specified
in a prospectus supplement or in a document we file with the SEC and
incorporate by reference.

   We compute the ratio of earnings to fixed charges by dividing earnings by
fixed charges. For purposes of this computation, earnings are defined as income
before income taxes, plus interest expense, including amortization of debt
discount and expense related to indebtedness and an estimated interest portion
of rental expense. Fixed charges are defined as interest expense, including
amortization of debt discount and expense related to indebtedness plus an
estimated interest portion of rental expense.

   We compute the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred
stock dividends by dividing earnings by the sum of fixed charges and dividends
on preferred stock.

                      DESCRIPTION OF THE DEBT SECURITIES

General

   The description below of the general terms of the debt securities will be
supplemented by the more specific terms in a prospectus supplement.

   The debt securities offered by this prospectus will be our unsecured
obligations and will be either senior or subordinated debt (together, the debt"
"17485","securities). We will issue the debt securities under one of two separate
indentures between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.
(formerly The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.) (the Trustee). Senior
debt will be issued under a senior note indenture and subordinated debt will be
issued under a subordinated note indenture. The senior note indenture and the
subordinated note indenture are sometimes referred to in this prospectus
individually as an indenture and collectively as the indentures. The
indentures provide that our debt securities may be issued in one or more
series, with different terms, in each case as authorized from time to time by
us. The indentures also give us the ability to reopen a previous issue of a
series of debt securities and issue additional debt securities of that series
or establish additional terms for that series of debt securities. None of the
indentures limits the amount of debt securities or other unsecured debt which
we may issue.

   Neither the senior debt securities nor the subordinated debt securities will
be secured by any of our property or assets. Thus, by owning a debt security,
you are one of our unsecured creditors.

   In addition to the following description of the debt securities, you should
refer to the detailed provisions of each indenture, copies of which are filed
as exhibits to the registration statement.

       authorized denominations if other than $1,000 and integral multiples of
       $1,000;

   .   the price(s) at which debt securities will be issued;

   .   whether the debt securities will be issued pursuant to a periodic

   .   the percentage of their principal amount at which the debt securities
       will be issued and, if applicable, the method of determining the price;

   .   the date or dates on which the debt securities will mature and any right
       to extend the date or dates;

   .   the currency, currencies or currency units in which payments on the debt

   .   the rate or rates at which the debt securities will bear interest, if
       any, or the method of determination (including indices) of the rate or

   .   the date or dates from which such interest, if any, shall accrue, the
       dates on which the interest, if any, will be payable and the method of
       determining holders to whom any of the interest shall be payable;

   .   any mandatory or optional sinking fund or analogous provisions;

       securities issued by us or a third party and the terms for any
       conversion or exchange or settlement;

   .   the exchanges, if any, on which the debt securities may be listed;

                                      3

<PAGE>

   .   any special provisions for the payment of additional amounts with
       respect to the debt securities;

   .   whether the debt securities are to be issuable as registered securities
       or bearer securities or both, whether any of the debt securities are to
       be issuable initially in temporary global form and whether any of the
       debt securities are to be issuable in permanent global form;

   .   each office or agency where the principal of and any premium and
       interest on the debt securities will be payable and each office or
       agency where the debt securities may be presented for registration of
       transfer or exchange;

   .   any right to defer payments of interest by extending the interest
       payment periods and the duration of the extensions;

   .   the trustee under the indenture pursuant to which the debt securities

   The senior debt securities will be unsecured and will rank equally with all
other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of WellPoint. The subordinated
debt securities will be unsecured and will rank subordinated and junior in
right of payment, to the extent set forth in the subordinated note indenture,
to all Senior Debt, as defined herein, of WellPoint. See Subordination below.

   Some of the debt securities may be issued as discounted debt securities to
be sold at a substantial discount below their stated principal amount. The
prospectus supplement will contain any United States federal income tax
consequences and other special considerations applicable to discounted debt
securities.

Payment and Transfer

   Unless we state otherwise in a prospectus supplement, we will issue debt
securities only as registered securities, which means that the name of the
holder will be entered in a register, which will be kept by the trustee or
another agent of ours. Unless we state otherwise in a prospectus supplement, we
will make principal and interest payments at the office of the paying agent or
agents we name in the prospectus supplement or by mailing a check to you at the
address we have for you in the register.

   Unless we state otherwise in a prospectus supplement, you will be able to
transfer registered debt securities at the office of the transfer agent or
agents we name in the prospectus supplement. You may also exchange registered
debt securities at the office of the transfer agent for an equal aggregate
principal amount of registered debt securities of the same series having the
same maturity date, interest rate and other terms as long as the debt
securities are issued in authorized denominations.

   Neither we nor the trustee will impose any service charge for any transfer
or exchange of a debt security; however, we may ask you to pay any taxes or
other governmental charges in connection with a transfer or exchange of debt
securities.

   If the debt securities are redeemable and we redeem less than all of the
debt securities of a particular series, we may block the transfer or exchange
of debt securities during a specified period of time in order to freeze the
list of holders to prepare the mailing. The period begins 15 days before the
day we mail the notice of redemption and ends on the day of that mailing. We
may also refuse to register transfers or exchanges of debt securities selected
for redemption. However, we will continue to permit transfers and exchanges of
the unredeemed portion of any debt security being partially redeemed.

Global Notes, Delivery and Form

   Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement, the debt securities
will be issued in the form of one or more fully registered Global Notes, as
defined below, that will be deposited with, or on behalf of, The

                                      4

<PAGE>

Depository Trust Company, referred to herein as the Depository, and registered
in the name of the Depository's nominee. Global Notes are not exchangeable for
definitive note certificates except in the specific circumstances described
below. For purposes of this prospectus, Global Note refers to the Global Note
or Global Notes representing an entire issue of debt securities.

   A Global Note may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another
nominee of the Depository or to a successor of the Depository or its nominee.

   The Depository has advised us as follows:

   .   The Depository is:

      .   a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State
          of New York;

      .   a banking organization within the meaning of the New York banking
          law;

      .   a member of the Federal Reserve System;

      .   a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform
          Commercial Code; and

      .   a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of
          Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

   .   The Depository was created to hold securities of its participants and to
       facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among
       its participants through electronic book entry changes in accounts of
       its participants, eliminating the need for physical movements of
       securities certificates.

   .   The Depository participants include securities brokers and dealers,
       banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and others, some of whom
       own the Depository.

   .   Access to the Depository book-entry system is also available to others
       that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a
       participant, either directly or indirectly.

   .   Where we issue a Global Note in connection with the sale thereof to an
       underwriter or underwriters, the Depository will immediately credit the
       accounts of participants designated by the underwriter or underwriters
       with the principal amount of the debt securities purchased by the
       underwriter or underwriters.

   .   Ownership of beneficial interests in a Global Note will be shown on, and
       the transfers of ownership will be effected only through, records
       maintained by the Depository (with respect to participants), by the
       participants (with respect to indirect participants and certain
       beneficial owners) and by the indirect participants (with respect to all
       other beneficial owners). The laws of some states require that certain
       purchasers of securities take physical delivery in definitive form of
       securities they purchase. These laws may limit your ability to transfer
       beneficial interests in a Global Note.

   So long as a nominee of the Depository is the registered owner of a Global
Note, that nominee for all purposes will be considered the sole owner or holder
of the debt securities under the applicable indenture. Except as provided
below, you will not be entitled to have debt securities registered in your
name, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of debt
securities in definitive form, and will not be considered the owners or holders
thereof under the applicable indenture.

   We will make payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, debt
securities represented by a Global Note to the Depository or its nominee, as
the case may be, as the registered owner and holder of the Global Note
representing those debt securities. The Depository has advised us that upon
receipt of any payment of principal of, or interest on, a Global Note, the
Depository will immediately credit accounts of participants with payments in
amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal
amount of that Global Note, as shown in the records of the Depository. Standing
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to
owners of beneficial interests in a Global Note held through those
participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of
customers registered in street name. Those payments will

                                      5

<PAGE>

be the sole responsibility of those participants, subject to any statutory or
regulatory requirements that may be in effect from time to time.

   Neither we, the trustee nor any of our respective agents will be responsible
in any respect for actions or inactions of the Depository, any nominee or any
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial interest in
a Global Note or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of the records
of the Depository, any nominee or any participant relating to those beneficial
interests.

   As described above, we will issue debt securities in definitive form in
exchange for a Global Note only in the following situations:

   .   if the Depository is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as
       depository and a successor depository is not appointed by us within
       90 days; or

   .   if we choose to issue definitive debt securities.

   In either instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note will
be entitled to have debt securities equal in principal amount to that
beneficial interest registered in its name and will be entitled to physical
delivery of debt securities in definitive form. Debt securities in definitive
form will be issued in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof
and will be issued in registered form only, without coupons. We will maintain
in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, one or more offices or
agencies where debt securities may be presented for payment and may be
transferred or exchanged. You will not be charged a fee for any transfer or
exchange of debt securities, but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Mergers and Similar Events

   We are generally permitted to consolidate with or merge into any other
person. In this section, person refers to any individual, corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, unincorporated
organization or government or any agency or political subdivision of a
government or governmental agency. We are also permitted to sell substantially
all of our assets to any other person, or to buy substantially all of the
assets of any other person. However, we may not take any of these actions
unless all the following conditions are met:

   .   Where we merge out of existence or sell all or substantially all of our
       assets, the other person may not be organized under a foreign country's
       laws (that is, it must be a corporation, partnership, limited liability
       company or trust organized under the laws of a state or the District of
       Columbia or under federal law) and it must agree to be legally
       responsible for the outstanding debt securities issued under the
       indentures. Upon assumption of our obligations by such a person in such
       circumstances, we shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants
       under the indentures and the debt securities.

   .   The merger, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other
       transaction must not cause a default on the debt securities, and we must
       not already be in default unless the merger or other transaction would
       cure the default. For purposes of this no-default test, a default would
       include an Event of Default that has occurred and not been cured, as
       described below under Events of Default. A default for this purpose
       would also include any event that would be an Event of Default if we
       received the required notice of our default or if under the indentures
       the default would become an Event of Default after existing for a
       specified period of time.

Modification and Waiver

   There are three types of changes we can make to the indentures and the debt
securities.

   Changes Requiring Your Approval. First, there are changes that cannot be
made to your debt securities without your specific approval. Following is a
list of those types of changes:

   .   change the stated maturity of the principal or interest on a debt
       security;

                                      6

<PAGE>

   .   reduce any amounts due on a debt security;

   .   reduce the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the maturity
       of a note following an Event of Default;

   .   change the place or currency of payment for a debt security;

   .   impair your right to sue for payment;

   .   reduce the percentage in principal amount of the debt securities, the
       approval of whose holders is needed to modify or amend the applicable
       indenture or the debt securities;

   .   reduce the percentage in principal amount of the debt securities, the
       approval of whose holders is needed to waive compliance with certain
       provisions of the applicable indenture or to waive certain defaults; and

   .   modify any other aspect of the provisions dealing with modification and
       waiver of the applicable indenture, except to increase the percentage
       required for any modification or to provide that other provisions of
       such indenture may not be modified or waived without your consent.

   Changes Not Requiring Approval. The second type of change does not require
any vote by holders of the debt securities. This type is limited to corrections
and clarifications and certain other changes that would not adversely affect
holders of the debt securities. Nor do we need any approval to make changes
that affect only debt securities to be issued under the applicable indenture
after the changes take effect. We may also make changes or obtain waivers that
do not adversely affect a particular debt security, even if they affect other
debt securities issued under the applicable indenture. In those cases, we need
only obtain any required approvals from the holders of the affected debt
securities.

   Changes Requiring a Majority Vote. Any other change to the applicable
indenture and the debt securities would require the following approval:

   .   If the change affects only debt securities of one series, it must be
       approved by the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount
       of the debt securities of that series.

   .   If the change affects the debt securities of one series as well as the
       debt securities of one or more other series issued under the applicable
       indenture, it must be approved by the holders of not less than a
       majority in principal amount of the debt securities of each series
       affected by the change. In each case, the required approval must be
       given by written consent. Most changes fall into this category.

   The same vote would be required for us to obtain a waiver of a past default.
However, we cannot obtain a waiver of a payment default or any other aspect of
the applicable indenture or the debt securities listed in the first category
described previously under Changes Requiring Your Approval unless we obtain
your individual consent to the waiver.

   Further Details Concerning Voting. Debt securities will not be considered
outstanding, and therefore not eligible to vote, if we have deposited or set
aside in trust for you money for their payment or redemption. Debt securities
will also not be eligible to vote if they have been fully defeased as described
later under Full Defeasance.

   We will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the
purpose of determining the holders of outstanding debt securities that are
entitled to vote or take other action under the applicable indenture. In
certain limited circumstances, the trustee will be entitled to set a record
date for action by holders. If we or the trustee set a record date for a vote
or other action to be taken by holders of debt securities, that vote or action
may be taken only by persons who are holders of outstanding debt securities on
the record date and must be taken within 180 days following the record date or
another period that we may specify (or as the trustee may specify, if it set
the record date). We may shorten or lengthen (but not beyond 180 days) this
period from time to time.

                                      7

Conversion and Exchange Rights

   The debt securities of any series may be convertible into or exchangeable
for other securities of WellPoint or another issuer or property or cash on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable prospectus
supplement.

   In particular, the prospectus supplement will specify:

   .   the type of securities into which the debt security may be converted or
       exchanged;

   .   the conversion price or exchange ratio, and its method of calculation;

   .   whether conversion or exchange is mandatory or at your election; and

   .   how the conversion price or exchange ratio may be adjusted if our debt
       securities are redeemed.

Defeasance

   The following discussion of full defeasance and discharge will apply to any
series of debt securities unless otherwise indicated in the applicable
prospectus supplement with respect to the debt securities of a series.

   Full Defeasance. If there is a change in U.S. federal tax law, as described
below, we can legally release ourselves from any payment or other obligations
on the debt securities (a full defeasance) if we put in place the following
other arrangements for you to be repaid:

   .   We must deposit in trust for your benefit and the benefit of all other
       direct holders of the debt securities of the same series a combination
       of money and U.S. government or U.S. government agency notes or bonds
       that will generate enough cash to make interest, principal, any premium
       and any other payments on the debt securities of that series on their
       various due dates.

   .   There must be a change in current U.S. federal tax law or an IRS ruling
       that lets us make the above deposit without causing you to be taxed on
       the debt securities any differently than if we did not make the deposit
       and instead repaid the debt securities ourselves when due. Under current
       U.S. federal tax law, the deposit and our legal release from the debt
       securities would be treated as though we took back your debt securities
       and gave you your share of the cash and debt securities or bonds
       deposited in trust. In that event, you could recognize gain or loss on
       the debt securities you give back to us.

   .   We must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel confirming
       the tax law change described above.

   If we ever did accomplish full defeasance, as described above, you would
have to rely solely on the trust deposit for repayment of the debt securities.
You could not look to us for repayment in the event of any shortfall.
Conversely, the trust deposit would most likely be protected from claims of our
lenders and other creditors if we ever become bankrupt or insolvent.

   In addition, the subordinated note indenture provides that if we choose to
have the defeasance and discharge provision applied to the subordinated debt
securities, the subordination provisions of the subordinated note indenture
will become ineffective upon full defeasance of the subordinated debt
securities.

   However, even if we make the deposit in trust and opinion delivery
arrangements discussed above, a number of our obligations relating to the debt
securities will remain. These include our obligations:

   .   to register the transfer and exchange of debt securities;

   .   to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen debt securities;

   .   to maintain paying agencies; and

   .   to hold money for payment in trust.

                                      8

<PAGE>

   Covenant Defeasance. Under current U.S. federal tax law, we can make the
same type of deposit described above and be released from some of the covenants
in the debt securities. This is called covenant defeasance. In that event,
you would lose the protection of those covenants but would gain the protection
of having money and securities set aside in trust to repay the debt securities.
In order to achieve covenant defeasance, we must do the following:

   .   We must deposit in trust for your benefit and the benefit of all other
       direct holders of the debt securities of the same series a combination
       of money and U.S. government or U.S. government agency notes or bonds
       that will generate enough cash to make interest, principal, any premium
       and any other payments on the debt securities of that series on their
       various due dates.

   .   We must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel confirming
       that under current U.S. federal income tax law we may make the above
       deposit without causing you to be taxed on the debt securities any
       differently than if we did not make the deposit and instead repaid the
       debt securities ourselves when due.

   If we accomplish covenant defeasance, you can still look to us for repayment
of the debt securities if there were a shortfall in the trust deposit. In fact,
if one of the Events of Default occurred (such as our bankruptcy) and the debt
securities become immediately due and payable, there may be such a shortfall.
Depending on the event causing the default, you may not be able to obtain
payment of the shortfall.

Satisfaction and Discharge

   The indentures will cease to be of further effect and the trustee, upon our
demand and at our expense, will execute appropriate instruments acknowledging
the satisfaction and discharge of the applicable indenture upon compliance with
certain conditions, including:

   .   Our having paid all sums payable by us under the applicable indenture,
       as and when the same shall be due and payable.

   .   Our having delivered to the trustee for cancellation all debt securities
       theretofore authenticated under the applicable indenture; or, all debt
       securities of any series outstanding under the applicable indenture not
       theretofore delivered to the trustee for cancellation shall have become
       due and payable or are by their terms to become due and payable within
       one year and we shall have deposited with the trustee sufficient cash or
       U.S. government or U.S. government agency notes or bonds that will
       generate enough cash to pay, at maturity or upon redemption, all such
       debt securities of any series outstanding under the applicable indenture.

   .   Our having delivered to the trustee an officer's certificate and an
       opinion of counsel, each stating that these conditions have been
       satisfied.

Highly Leveraged Transaction

   The general provisions of the indentures do not afford holders of the debt
securities protection in the event of a highly leveraged or other transaction
involving us that may adversely affect holders of the debt securities.

Subordination

   Any subordinated debt securities issued under the subordinated note
indenture will be subordinate and junior in right of payment to all of our
Senior Debt (including all debt securities issued under the senior note
indenture) whether existing at the date of the subordinated note indenture or
subsequently incurred. Upon any payment or distribution of our assets to
creditors upon any:

   .   liquidation;

   .   dissolution;

                                      9

<PAGE>

   .   winding-up;

   .   receivership;

   .   reorganization;

   .   assignment for the benefit of creditors;

   .   marshaling of assets and liabilities;

   .   bankruptcy;

   .   insolvency; or

   .   debt restructuring or similar proceedings in connection with any
       insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding,

the holders of Senior Debt will first be entitled to receive payment in full of
the principal of and any premium and interest on such Senior Debt before the
holders of the subordinated debt securities will be entitled to receive or
retain any payment in respect of the principal of and any premium or interest
on the subordinated debt securities.

   Upon the acceleration of the maturity of any subordinated debt securities,
the holders of all Senior Debt outstanding at the time of the acceleration will
first be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due thereon,
including any amounts due upon acceleration, before the holders of subordinated
debt securities will be entitled to receive or retain any payment in respect of
the principal of or any premium or interest on the subordinated debt securities.

   No payments on account of principal, or any premium or interest, in respect
of the subordinated debt securities may be made if:

   .   there has occurred and is continuing a default in any payment with
       respect to Senior Debt; or

   .   there has occurred and is continuing an event of default with respect to
       any Senior Debt resulting in the acceleration of, or permitting the
       holder or holders thereof to accelerate, the maturity thereof.

   Senior Debt means the principal of, and any premium and interest,
including interest accruing on or after the filing of any petition in
bankruptcy or for reorganization relating to us, whether or not such claim for
post-petition interest is allowed in such proceeding, on our Debt, whether
incurred on, before or after the date of the subordinated note indenture,
unless the instrument creating or evidencing the Debt or under which the Debt
is outstanding provides that obligations created by it are not superior in
right of payment to the subordinated debt securities.

   Debt means, with respect to any person, whether recourse is to all or a
portion of the assets of that person and whether or not contingent:

   .   every obligation of that person for money borrowed;

   .   every obligation of that person evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or
       other similar instruments, including obligations incurred in connection
       with the acquisition of property, assets or businesses;

   .   every reimbursement obligation of that person with respect to letters of
       credit, bankers' acceptances or similar facilities issued for the
       account of that person;

   .   every obligation of that person incurred in connection with the
       acquisition of property or services, but excluding trade accounts
       payable or accrued liabilities arising in the ordinary course of
       business;

   .   every capital lease obligation of that person; and

   .   every obligation of the type referred to above of another person and all
       dividends of another person the payment of which, in either case, such
       person has guaranteed or for which such person is responsible or liable,
       directly or indirectly, as obligor or otherwise.

   The indentures will place no limitation on the amount of additional Senior
Debt that we may incur.

Events of Default

   Each indenture defines an Event of Default with respect to any series of
debt securities. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus
supplement, Events of Default are any of the following:

   .   We do not pay the principal or any premium on a note on its due date.

   .   We do not pay interest on a note within 30 days of its due date.

   .   We remain in breach of any other term of the applicable indenture for
       60 days after we receive a notice of default stating we are in breach.
       The notice must be sent by either the trustee or holders of 25% of the
       principal amount of the debt securities of the affected series.

   .   We file for bankruptcy or certain other events in bankruptcy, insolvency
       or reorganization occur.

   An Event of Default under one series of debt securities does not necessarily
constitute an Event of Default under any other series of debt securities. Each
indenture provides that the trustee may withhold notice to the holders of any
series of debt securities issued thereunder of any default if the trustee
considers it in the interest of such holders to do so provided the trustee may
not withhold notice of default in the payment of principal, premium, if any, or
interest, if any, on any of the debt securities of that series or in the making
of any sinking fund installment or analogous obligation with respect to that
series.

   Remedies If an Event of Default Occurs. Each indenture provides that if an
Event of Default has occurred and has not been cured, the trustee or the
holders of 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of the affected
series may declare the entire principal amount of all the debt securities of
that series to be due and immediately payable. This is called a declaration of
acceleration of maturity. If an Event of Default occurs because of certain
events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, the principal amount of all
the debt securities will be automatically accelerated, without any action by
the trustee or any holder. A declaration of acceleration of maturity may be
cancelled by the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the debt
securities of the affected series if certain conditions are satisfied.

   Except as may otherwise be provided in the indentures in cases of default,
where the trustee has some special duties, the trustee is not required to take
any action under the applicable indenture at the request of any holders unless
the holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from expenses and liability
(an indemnity). If a reasonable indemnity is provided, the holders of a
majority in principal amount of the debt securities outstanding of the affected
series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other
formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the trustee. Subject to
certain exceptions contained in the indentures, these majority holders may also
direct the trustee in performing any other action under the applicable
indenture.

   Before you bypass the trustee and bring your own lawsuit or other formal
legal action or take other steps to enforce your rights or protect your
interests relating to the debt securities, the following must occur:

   .   You must give the trustee written notice that an Event of Default has
       occurred and remains uncured.

   .   The holders of 25% in principal amount of all outstanding debt
       securities of the affected series must make a written request that the
       trustee take action because of the Event of Default, and must offer
       reasonable indemnity to the trustee against the cost and other
       liabilities of taking that action.

   .   The trustee must have not taken action for 60 days after receipt of the
       above notice and offer of indemnity.

   However, you are entitled at any time to bring a lawsuit for the payment of
money due on your debt security on or after the due date of that payment.

                                      11

   We will furnish to the trustee every year a written statement of two of our
officers certifying that to their knowledge we are in compliance with the
indentures and the debt securities, or else specifying any default.

Governing Law

   The indentures and the debt securities will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York, except to the extent that
the Trust Indenture Act applies.

                      DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED STOCK

   This section describes the general terms and provisions of the preferred
stock we may offer by this prospectus. The applicable prospectus supplement
will describe the specific terms of the series of the preferred stock then
offered, and the terms and provisions described in this section will apply only
to the extent not superseded by the terms of the applicable prospectus
supplement.

   This section is only a summary of the preferred stock that we may offer. We
urge you to read carefully our articles of incorporation and the articles of
amendment we have filed or will file in relation to an issue of any particular
series of preferred stock before you buy any preferred stock.

   We are authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
without par value, none of which is issued or outstanding. Our board of
directors may issue from time to time shares of preferred stock in one or more
series and with the relative powers, rights and preferences and for the
consideration our board of directors may determine.

   Our board of directors may, without further action of the shareholders,
determine and set forth in an amendment to our articles of incorporation the
following for each series of preferred stock:

   .   the serial designation and the number of shares in that series;

   .   the dividend rate or rates, whether dividends shall be cumulative and,
       if so, from what date, the payment date or dates for dividends, and any
       participating or other special rights with respect to dividends;

   .   any voting powers of the shares;

   .   whether the shares will be redeemable and, if so, the price or prices at
       which, and the terms and conditions on which the shares may be redeemed;

   .   the amount or amounts payable upon the shares in the event of voluntary
       or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of us prior to any
       payment or distribution of our assets to any class or classes of our
       stock ranking junior to the preferred stock;

   .   whether the shares will be entitled to the benefit of a sinking fund
       and, if so entitled, the amount of the fund and the manner of its
       application, including the price or prices at which the shares may be
       redeemed or purchased through the application of the fund;

   .   whether the shares will be convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares
       of any other class or of any other series of the same or any other class
       of our stock or the stock of another issuer, and if so convertible or
       exchangeable, the conversion price or prices, or the rates of exchange,
       and any adjustments to the conversion price or rates of exchange at
       which the conversion or exchange may be made, and any other terms and
       conditions of the conversion or exchange; and

   .   any other preferences, privileges and powers, and relative,
       participating, optional, or other special rights, and qualifications,
       limitations or restrictions, as our board of directors may deem
       advisable and as shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of our
       articles of incorporation.

   Depending on the rights prescribed for a series of preferred stock, the
issuance of preferred stock could have an adverse effect on the voting power of
the holders of common stock and could adversely affect holders of common stock
by delaying or preventing a change in control of us, making removal of our
present management more difficult or imposing restrictions upon the payment of
dividends and other distributions to the holders of common stock.

   The preferred stock, when issued, will be fully paid and nonassessable.
Unless the applicable prospectus supplement provides otherwise, the preferred
stock will have no preemptive rights to subscribe for any additional securities
which may be issued by us in the future. The transfer agent and registrar for
the preferred stock will be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.

                        DESCRIPTION OF THE COMMON STOCK

   The following is a summary of the terms of our common stock. For additional
information regarding our common stock, please refer to our articles of
incorporation, our by-laws and the applicable provisions of Indiana law.

General

   We are authorized to issue up to 900,000,000 shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share. Each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote
per share of record on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders.
Holders do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors or
any other matter. Subject to the preferential rights of the holders of any
preferred stock that may at the time be outstanding, each share of common stock
will entitle the holder of that share to an equal and ratable right to receive
dividends or other distributions (other than purchases, redemptions or other
acquisitions of shares by us) if declared from time to time by our board of
directors and if there are sufficient funds to legally pay a dividend.

   In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, whether
voluntary or involuntary, the holders of common stock will be entitled to share
ratably in all assets remaining after payments to creditors and after
satisfaction of the liquidation preference, if any, of the holders of any
preferred stock that may at the time be outstanding. Holders of common stock
have no preemptive or redemption rights and will not be subject to further
calls or assessments by us. Any shares of common stock offered by this
prospectus will, when issued, be fully paid and non-assessable.

Authorized But Unissued Shares

   Indiana law does not require shareholder approval for any issuance of
authorized shares. Authorized but unissued shares may be used for a variety of
corporate purposes, including future public or private offerings to raise
additional capital or to facilitate corporate acquisitions. One of the effects
of the existence of authorized but unissued shares may be to enable the board
of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, which
issuance could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control
of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and
thereby protect the continuity of current management and possibly deprive the
shareholders of opportunities to sell their shares of common stock at prices
higher than prevailing market prices.

Limitations on Ownership of Our Common Stock in Articles of Incorporation

   As required under our Blue Cross Blue Shield Association license, our
articles of incorporation contain certain limitations on the ownership of our
common stock. Our articles of incorporation provide that subsequent to our
demutualization which took place on November 2, 2001, no person may
beneficially own shares of voting capital stock in excess of specified
ownership limits, except with the prior approval of a majority of the
continuing directors. The ownership limits, which may not be exceeded without
the prior approval of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, are the following:

   .   for any institutional investor (as defined in our articles of
       incorporation), one share less than 10% of our outstanding voting
       securities;

   .   for any non-institutional investor (as defined in our articles of
       incorporation), one share less than 5% of WellPoint's outstanding voting
       securities; and

   .   for any person, one share less than the number of shares of our common
       stock or other equity securities (or a combination thereof) representing
       a 20% ownership interest in us.

   Any transfer of stock that would result in any person beneficially owning
shares of capital stock in excess of any ownership limit will result in the
intended transferee acquiring no rights in the shares exceeding such

                                      14

<PAGE>

ownership limit (with certain exceptions) and the person's excess shares will
be deemed transferred to an escrow agent to be held until the shares are
transferred to a person whose ownership of the shares will not violate the
ownership limit.

Certain Other Provisions of Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws

   Certain other provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws may
delay or make more difficult unsolicited acquisitions or changes of control of
us. These provisions could have the effect of discouraging third parties from
making proposals involving an unsolicited acquisition or change in control of
us, although these proposals, if made, might be considered desirable by a
majority of our shareholders. These provisions may also have the effect of
making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of the
current management without the concurrence of the board of directors. These
provisions include:

   .   the division of the board of directors into three classes serving
       staggered terms of office of three years;

   .   provisions limiting the maximum number of directors to 19, and requiring
       that any increase in the number of directors then in effect must be
       approved by a majority of continuing directors;

   .   permitting only the board of directors, the Chair of the Board, the Lead
       Director, the Chief Executive Officer or the President to call a special
       meeting of shareholders; and

   .   requirements for advance notice for raising business or making
       nominations at shareholders' meetings.

   Our by-laws establish an advance notice procedure with regard to business to
be brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders and with regard
to the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than by or at
the direction of the board of directors. Although our by-laws do not give the
board of directors any power to approve or disapprove shareholder nominations
for the election of directors or proposals for action, they may have the effect
of precluding a contest for the election of directors or the consideration of
shareholder proposals if the established procedures are not followed, and of
discouraging or deterring a third party from conducting a solicitation of
proxies to elect its own slate of directors or to approve its proposal without
regard to whether consideration of those nominees or proposals might be harmful
or beneficial to us and our shareholders.

Amendment and Repeal of By-Laws

   WellPoint's by-laws provide that, in general, the board of directors may
amend, rescind or change the by-laws by the affirmative vote of a majority of
the entire number of directors.

Listing

   Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
WLP. Computershare Limited is the registrar, transfer agent, conversion agent
and dividend disbursing agent for the common stock.
