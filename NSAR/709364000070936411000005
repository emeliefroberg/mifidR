The Adviser shall, during the term and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, (a) determine the composition of the portfolio of the Series, the nature and timing of the changes therein and the manner of implementing such changes, and (b) provide the Series with such investment advisory, research and related services as the Series may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of its funds. The Adviser shall perform such duties in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Fund's Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and current prospectus and any directions it may receive from the Fund's Trustees.</LI></P>"

Except as otherwise provided in Paragraphs 1 and 3 hereof, the Fund shall be responsible for effecting sales and redemptions of the Series' shares, for determining the net asset value thereof and for all of the Series' other operations and shall cause the Series to pay all administrative and other costs and expenses attributable to its operations and transactions, including, without limitation, transfer agent and custodian fees; legal, administrative and clerical services; rent for office space and facilities; auditing; preparation, printing and distribution of its prospectuses, proxy statements, shareholders' reports and notices; supplies and postage; Federal and state registration fees; Federal, state and local taxes; non-affiliated Trustees' fees; and brokerage commissions.</LI></P>"
"11083","<U><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><LI>Expenses Payable by the Adviser</U>. The Adviser shall pay all expenses which it may incur in performing its duties under Paragraph 1 hereof and shall reimburse the Fund for any space leased by the Fund and occupied by the Adviser. In the event the Fund shall qualify shares of the Series for sale in any jurisdiction, the applicable statutes or regulations of which expressly limit the amount of the Series' total annual expenses, the Adviser agrees to reduce its annual investment advisory fee for the Series, to the extent that such total annual expenses (other than brokerage commissions and other capital items, interest, taxes, distribution fees, extraordinary items and other excludable items, charges, costs and expenses) exceed the limitations imposed on the Series by the most stringent regulations of any such jurisdiction.</LI></P>"
"11084","<U><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><LI>Compensation of the Adviser</U>. The Fund agrees to cause the Series to pay to the Adviser, and the Adviser agrees to accept as compensation for the services provided by the Adviser hereunder, a fee equal to 1.00% per annum of the first $2,000,000,000 of the Series' average net assets at the close of business on each day that the value of its net assets is computed during the year, 0.95% per annum of the next $2,000,000,000 of the Series' average net assets, 0.90% per annum of the next $2,000,000,000 of the Series' average net assets and 0.85% per annum of the Series' average net assets in excess of $6,000,000,000. However, the Fund and the Adviser may agree in writing to temporarily or permanently reduce such fee. Such compensation shall be accrued on the Series' books at the close of business on each day that the value of its net assets is computed during each year and shall be payable to the Adviser monthly, on the last day of each month, and adjusted as of year-end if required.<"
