"1977","series of Columbia Funds Series Trust II and hereafter referred to as the"
"1978","Funds) as of and for the year ended August 31, 2012, in accordance with the"
"1979","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1980","considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"1981","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1982","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"1983","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1984","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal"
"1985","control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on"
"1986","the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"1987","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1988","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"1989","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"1990","the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control"
"1991","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"1992","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"1993","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally"
"1994","accepted accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial"
"1995","reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"1996","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"1997","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund;"
"1998","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to"

"2001","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"2002","trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"2003","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's"
"2004","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2005","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"2006","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"2007","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"2008","become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"2009","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2010","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"2011","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"2012","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"2013","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"2014","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"2015","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"2016","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"

"2144","At a meeting held on June 14, 2012, the Board of Trustees of the Trust, upon"
"2145","recommendation of the Audit Committee, approved the replacement of Ernst &"
"2146","Young LLP (Ernst & Young) as the independent registered public accounting firm"
"2147","for each of the funds in the Trust and certain other funds in the Columbia"
"2148","Family of Funds (collectively, the Funds) and appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers"
"2149","LLP (PwC). PwC's engagement was effective at the completion of Ernst & Young's"
"2150","audits of the financial statements of Funds with fiscal years ended July 31,"
"2151","2012. The Funds did not consult with PwC during the fiscal years ended"
"2152","August 31, 2011 and 2010 for the Columbia Diversified Bond Fund and the fiscal"
"2153","period ended August 31, 2011 for the Columbia Marsico Flexible Capital Fund and"
"2154","through the June meeting."
"2155","Ernst & Young's reports on the financial statements of each of the funds in the"
"2156","Trust as of and for the fiscal periods ended August 31, 2012 and 2011 contained"
"2157","no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified"
"2158","as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During such fiscal"
"2159","periods, there were no: (1) disagreements between the Funds and Ernst & Young"
"2160","on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement"
"2161","disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Ernst &"
