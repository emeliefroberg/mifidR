"2855","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of the FBR Large Cap Fund, FBR Mid Cap Fund, FBR Small Cap Fund, FBR Focus Fund, FBR Large Cap Financial Fund, FBR Small Cap Financial Fund, FBR Technology Fund, and FBR Gas Utility Index Fund (the &#147;Funds&#148;), in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered their internal control over financial reporting, including control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds&#146; internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"2856","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.   In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.   A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance generally accepted accounting principles.   A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and "
"2857","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"2858","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.   Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"2859","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.   A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company&#146;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."

"2914","AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION"
"2915","The Board of Trustees (the &#147;Board&#148;) of The FBR Funds, a Delaware statutory trust with its principal place of business at 1001 Nineteenth Street North, Arlington, Virginia (the &#147;Trust&#148;), deems it advisable that FBR Pegasus Small Cap Fund (the &#147;Acquiring Fund&#148;), a series of the Trust, and FBR Pegasus Small Cap Growth Fund (the Acquired Fund&#148;), also a series of the Trust, engage in the reorganization described below."
"2916","This Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization and liquidation  (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;).  The reorganization (the &#147;Reorganization&#148;) will consist of the transfer of all of the assets of the Acquired Fund to the Acquiring Fund in exchange solely for the classes of shares of beneficial interest of the Acquiring Fund as listed in Schedule A (the &#147;Acquiring Fund Shares&#148;), the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of the liabilities of the Acquired Fund described in paragraph 1.3, and the distribution of the Acquiring Fund Shares to the shareholders of the Acquired Fund in complete liquidation of the Acquired Fund as provided herein, all upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth in this Agreement."
"2917","WHEREAS, the Acquired Fund and Acquiring Fund are each a series of an open-end, registered investment company of the management type and the Acquired Fund owns securities that generally are assets of the character in which the Acquiring Fund is permitted to invest; and"
"2918","WHEREAS, the Board of the Trust has determined, with respect to the Acquiring Fund, that the exchange of all of the assets of the Acquired Fund for Acquiring Fund Shares and the assumption of the liabilities of the Acquired Fund by the Acquiring Fund, as described in paragraph 1.3 herein, is in the best interests of the Acquiring Fund and its shareholders and that the interests of the existing shareholders of the Acquiring Fund would not be diluted as a result of this transaction; and"
"2919","WHEREAS, the Board of the Trust has also determined, with respect to the Acquired Fund, that the exchange of all of the assets of the Acquired Fund for the Acquiring Fund Shares and the assumption of the liabilities of the Acquired Fund by the Acquiring Funds, as described in paragraph 1.3 herein, is in the best interests of the Acquired Fund and its shareholders and that the interests of the existing shareholders of the Acquired Fund would not be diluted as a result of this transaction."
"2920","NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the Trust, on behalf of the Acquiring Fund and the Acquired Fund separately, hereby covenants and agrees as follows:"
"2921","1.	TRANSFER OF ASSETS OF THE ACQUIRED FUND TO THE ACQUIRING FUND IN EXCHANGE FOR ACQUIRING FUND SHARES, THE ASSUMPTION OF THE LIABILITIES OF THE ACQUIRED FUND AND THE LIQUIDATION OF THE ACQUIRED FUND"
"2922","1.1.	Subject to the requisite approvals and the other terms and conditions herein set forth and on the basis of the representations and warranties contained herein, the Acquired Fund agrees to transfer all of its respective assets, as set forth in paragraph 1.2, to the Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund agrees in exchange therefor: (i) to deliver to the Acquired Fund the number of full and fractional Acquiring Fund Shares as of the time and date set forth in paragraph 2.1 and (ii) to assume the liabilities of the Acquired Fund, as set forth in paragraph 1.3.  Such transactions shall take place at the closing provided for in paragraph 3.1 (the &#147;Closing&#148;)."
"2923","1.2.	The assets of the Acquired Fund to be acquired by the Acquiring Fund shall consist of all assets and property, including, without limitation, all cash, securities, commodities and futures interests, claims (whether absolute or contingent, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued) and dividends or interest receivable that are owned by the Acquired Fund and any deferred or prepaid expenses shown as an asset on the books of the Acquired Fund on the closing date provided for in paragraph 3.1 (the &#147;Closing Date&#148;) (collectively, &#147;Assets&#148;)."
"2924","1.3.	The Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the liabilities of the Acquired Fund.   The Acquired Fund shall deliver to the Acquiring Fund the Acquired Fund&#146;s Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of the Closing Date pursuant to paragraph 8.2 hereof."
"2925","1.4.	Immediately after the transfer of assets provided for in paragraph 1.1, the Acquired Fund will: (i) distribute to the Acquired Fund&#146;s shareholders of record with respect to the classes of shares listed in Schedule A, determined as of immediately after the close of business on the Closing Date, on a pro rata basis within each class, the Acquiring Fund Shares of the class received by the Acquired Fund pursuant to paragraph 1.1 (as listed in Schedule A) and (ii) completely liquidate.  Such distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with respect to each class of the Acquired Fund&#146;s shares, by the transfer of the Acquiring Fund Shares then credited to the account of the Acquired Fund on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open accounts on the share records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the shareholders of record of each class of the Acquired Fund&#146;s shares, determined as of immediately after the close of business on the Closing Date (the &#147;Acquired Fund Shareholders&#148;).  "
"2926","The aggregate net asset value of such classes of Acquiring Fund Shares to be so credited to such Acquired Fund Shareholders shall, with respect to each class, be equal to the aggregate net asset value of the Acquired Fund shares of that class owned by such shareholders on the Closing Date.  All issued and outstanding classes of Acquired Fund shares as listed in Schedule A will simultaneously be canceled on the books of the Acquired Fund.  The Acquiring Fund shall not issue certificates representing such Acquiring Fund Shares in connection with such exchange."
"2927","1.5.	Ownership of Acquiring Fund Shares of the Acquiring Fund will be shown on its books.  Acquiring Fund Shares will be issued in the manner described in the Acquiring Fund&#146;s current prospectus."
"2928","1.6.	Any reporting responsibility of the Acquired Fund including, but not limited to, the responsibility for filing of regulatory reports, tax returns, or other documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;), any state securities commission, and any federal, state or local tax authorities or any other relevant regulatory authority, is and shall remain the responsibility of the Acquired Fund."
"2929","1.7.	As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, the Acquired Fund shall make all filings and take all steps as shall be necessary and proper to effect its complete dissolution."
"2930","2.	VALUATION"
"2931","2.1.	The value of the Assets shall be the value computed as of immediately after the close of business of the New York Stock Exchange (after the declaration of any dividends) (such time and date being hereinafter called the &#147;Valuation Date&#148;), using the valuation procedures set forth in the Trust&#146;s Declaration of Trust and then-current prospectus and statement of additional information with respect to the Acquiring Fund, and valuation procedures established by the Acquiring Fund&#146;s Board."
"2932","2.2.	All computations of value shall be made by the Acquired Fund&#146;s designated record keeping agent and shall be subject to review by the Acquiring Fund&#146;s record keeping agent and by each  Fund&#146;s respective independent registered public accountants."
"2933","3.	CLOSING AND CLOSING DATE"
"2934","3.1.	The Closing Date shall be August 27, 2010, or such other date as the parties may agree to in writing.  All acts taking place at the Closing shall be deemed to take place simultaneously as of immediately after the close of business on the Closing Date unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.  The close of business on the Closing Date shall be as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time.  The Closing shall be held at the offices of the Trust or at such other time and/or place as the parties may agree."
"2935","3.2.	The Trust shall direct JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as custodian for the Acquired Fund (the &#147;Custodian&#148;), to deliver, at the Closing, a certificate of an authorized officer stating that (i) the Assets shall have been delivered in proper form to each Acquiring Fund within two business days prior to or on the Closing Date; and (ii) all necessary taxes in connection with the delivery of the Assets, including all applicable federal and state stock transfer stamps, if any, have been paid or provision for payment has been made.  The Acquired Fund&#146;s portfolio securities represented by a certificate or other written instrument shall be presented by the Custodian to those persons at the Custodian who have primary responsibility for the safekeeping of the Assets of the Acquiring Fund for examination no later than five business days preceding the Closing Date, and shall be transferred and delivered by the Acquired Fund as of the Closing Date for the account of the Acquiring Fund duly endorsed in prope"
