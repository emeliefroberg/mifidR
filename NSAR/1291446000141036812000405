"920","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"921","To the Board of Trustees of Credit Suisse Commodity Strategy Funds"
"922","and the Shareholders of Credit Suisse Commodity ACCESS Strategy Fund:"
"923","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"924","Credit Suisse Commodity ACCESS Strategy Fund (a portfolio of Credit"
"925","Suisse Commodity Strategy Funds) and consolidated Cayman subsidiary"
"926","(the Fund) as of and for the year ended October 31, 2012, in"
"927","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"928","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"929","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"930","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"931","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"932","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"933","Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"934","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"935","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"936","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"937","reporting."
"938","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"939","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"940","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"941","management are required to assess the expected benefits and related"
"942","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over financial"
"943","reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"944","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"945","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with"
"946","generally accepted accounting principles.  A fund's internal control"
"947","over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that"
"948","(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"949","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of"
"950","the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"951","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"952","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"953","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being"
"954","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"955","trustees of the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"956","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"957","disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material effect on"
"958","the financial statements."
"959","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"960","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"961","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to"
"962","the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"963","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"964","procedures may deteriorate."
"965","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"966","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"967","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"968","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"969","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"970","deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"971","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement"
"972","of the fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"973","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"974","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"975","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"976","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"977","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"978","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"979","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no"
"980","deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"981","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"982","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"983","above as of October 31, 2012."
"984","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"985","management and the Board of Trustees of Credit Suisse Opportunity"
"986","Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"987","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"988","parties."

"1099","Dear Sirs:"
"1100","            Credit Suisse Commodity Strategy Funds, a Delaware business"
"1101","trust (formerly, Credit Suisse Commodity Return Strategy Fund) (the"
"1102","Fund), for and on behalf of its series listed on Annex I hereto,"
"1103","which may be amended from time to time (each, a Series and,"
"1104","collectively, the Series), herewith confirms its agreement with"
"1105","Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC (the Adviser) as follows:"
"1106","1. Investment Description; Appointment"
"1107","            The Fund, on behalf of its respective Series, desires to"
"1108","employ the capital of such Series by investing and reinvesting in"
"1109","investments of the kind and in accordance with the limitations"
"1110","pecified in its Trust Instrument, as may be amended from time to time,"
"1111","and in each Series' Prospectus(es) and Statement(s) of Additional"
"1112","Information as from time to time in effect (the Prospectus and"
"1113","SAI, respectively), and in such manner and to such extent as may"
"1114","from time to time be approved by the Board of Trustees of the Fund."
"1115","Copies of each Series' Prospectus and SAI have been or will be"
"1116","submitted to the Adviser.  The Fund desires to employ and hereby"
"1117","appoints the Adviser to act as investment adviser to each Series."
"1118","The Adviser accepts the appointment and agrees to furnish the"
"1119","services for the compensation set forth below."
"1120","1. Services as Investment Adviser"
"1121","            Subject to the supervision and direction of the Board of"
"1122","Trustees of the Fund, the Adviser will (a) act in strict conformity"
"1123","with the Fund's Trust Instrument, the Investment Company Act of 1940,"
"1124","as amended, (the 1940 Act) and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,"
"1125","as the same may from time to time be amended, (b) manage each Series'"
"1126","assets in accordance with such Series' investment objective and"
"1127","policies as stated in the Series' Prospectus and SAI, (c) make"
"1128","investment decisions for each Series, (d) place purchase and sale"
"1129","orders for securities on behalf of each Series, (e) exercise voting"
"1130","rights in respect of portfolio securities and other investments for"
"1131","each Series, and (f) monitor and evaluate the services provided by"
"1132","each Series' investment sub-adviser(s), if any, under the terms of"
"1133","the applicable investment sub-advisory agreement.   In providing those"
"1134","services, the Adviser will provide investment research and supervision"
"1135","of each Series' investments and conduct a continual program of"
"1136","investment, evaluation and, if appropriate, sale and reinvestment of"
"1137","such Series' assets.  In addition, the Adviser will furnish each"
"1138","Series with whatever statistical information the Fund may reasonably"
"1139","request with respect to the securities that such Series may hold or"
"1140","contemplate purchasing."
"1141","            Subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees of the"
"1142","Fund and, where required, the Series' shareholders, the Adviser may"
"1143","engage an investment sub-adviser or sub-advisers to provide advisory"
"1144","services in respect of a Series and may delegate to such investment"
"1145","sub-adviser(s) the responsibilities described in subparagraphs (b),"
"1146","(c), (d) and (e) above.  In the event that an investment sub-adviser's"
"1147","engagement has been terminated, the Adviser shall be responsible for"
"1148","furnishing each Series with the services required to be performed by"
"1149","such investment sub-adviser(s) under the applicable investment"
"1150","sub-advisory agreement(s) or arranging for a successor investment"
"1151","sub-adviser(s) to provide such services on terms and conditions"
"1152","acceptable to the Series and the Fund's Board of Trustees and"
"1153","subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act."
"1154","2. Brokerage"
"1155","            In executing transactions for each Series, selecting"
"1156","brokers or dealers and negotiating any brokerage commission rates,"
"1157","the Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall"
"1158","terms available.  In assessing the best overall terms available"
"1159","for any portfolio transaction, the Adviser will consider all"
"1160","factors it deems relevant including, but not limited to, breadth"
"1161","of the market in the security, the price of the security, the"
"1162","financial condition and execution capability of the broker or"
"1163","dealer and the reasonableness of any commission for the specific"
"1164","transaction and for transactions executed through the broker or"
"1165","dealer in the aggregate.  In selecting brokers or dealers to"
"1166","execute a particular transaction and in evaluating the best"
"1167","overall terms available, the Adviser may consider the brokerage"
"1168","and research services (as those terms are defined in Section"
"1169","28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as the same may"
"1170","from time to time be amended) provided to each Series and/or"
"1171","other accounts over which the Adviser or an affiliate exercises"
"1172","investment discretion."
"1173","3. Information Provided to the Fund"
"1174","            The Adviser will keep each Series informed of"
"1175","developments materially affecting such Series, and will, on"
"1176","its own initiative, furnish such Series from time to time with"
"1177","whatever information the Adviser believes is appropriate for"
"1178","this purpose."
"1179","4. Standard of Care"
"1180","            The Adviser shall exercise its best judgment in"
"1181","rendering the services listed in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above."
"1182","The Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment or"
"1183","mistake of law or for any loss suffered by a Series in connection"
"1184","with the matters to which this Agreement relates, provided that"
"1185","nothing herein shall be deemed to protect or purport to protect"
"1186","the Adviser against any liability to each Series or to shareholders"
"1187","of such Series to which the Adviser would otherwise be subject by"
"1188","reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on"
"1189","its part in the performance of its duties or by reason of the"
"1190","Adviser's reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under"
"1191","this Agreement."
"1192","5. Compensation"
"1193","            In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to"
"1194","this Agreement, each Series will pay the Adviser an annual fee"
"1195","applicable to such Series calculated at an annual rate set forth"
"1196","on Annex I hereto of such Series' average daily net assets.  The"
"1197","fee for the period from the date of this Agreement to the end of"
"1198","the calendar year shall be prorated according to the proportion"
"1199","that such period bears to the full yearly period.  Upon any"
"1200","termination of this Agreement before the end of a year, the fee"
"1201","for such part of that year shall be prorated according to the"
"1202","proportion that such period bears to the full yearly period and"
"1203","shall be payable upon the date of termination of this Agreement."
"1204","For the purpose of determining fees payable to the Adviser, the"
"1205","value of each Series' net assets shall be computed at the times"
"1206","and in the manner specified in such Series' Prospectus or SAI."
"1207","6. Expenses"
"1208","            The Adviser will bear all expenses in connection"
"1209","with the performance of its services under this Agreement,"
"1210","including the fees payable to any investment sub-adviser engaged"
"1211","pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Agreement.  Each Series will bear"
"1212","its proportionate share of certain other expenses to be incurred in"
"1213","its operation, including:  investment advisory and administration"
"1214","fees; taxes, interest, brokerage fees and commissions, if any; fees"
"1215","of Trustees of the Fund who are not officers, directors, or"
"1216","employees of the Adviser, any sub-adviser, or any of their"
"1217","affiliates; fees of any pricing service employed to value shares of"
"1218","the Series; Securities and Exchange Commission fees and state blue"
"1219","sky qualification fees; charges of custodians and transfer and"
"1220","dividend disbursing agents; each Series proportionate share of"
"1221","insurance premiums; outside auditing and legal expenses; costs"
"1222","of maintenance of each Series' existence; costs attributable to"
"1223","investor services, including, without limitation, telephone and"
"1224","personnel expenses; costs of preparing and printing prospectuses"
"1225","and statements of additional information for regulatory purposes"
"1226","and for distribution to existing shareholders; costs of shareholders'"
"1227","reports and meetings of the shareholders of such Series and of the"
"1228","officers or Board of Trustees of the Fund; and any extraordinary"
"1229","expenses."
"1230","            Each Series will be responsible for nonrecurring"
"1231","expenses which may arise, including costs of litigation to which"
"1232","the Fund is a party and of indemnifying officers and Trustees of"
"1233","such Series with respect to such litigation and other expenses as"
"1234","determined by the Trustees."
"1235","7. Services to Other Companies or Accounts"
"1236","            The Fund understands that the Adviser now acts, will"
"1237","continue to act and may act in the future as investment adviser"
"1238","to fiduciary and other managed accounts and to one or more other"
"1239","investment companies or series of investment companies, and the"
"1240","Fund has no objection to the Adviser so acting, provided that"
"1241","whenever a Series and one or more other accounts or investment"
"1242","companies or portfolios advised by the Adviser have available"
"1243","funds for investment, investments suitable and appropriate for"
"1244","each will be allocated in accordance with a formula believed to"
"1245","be equitable to each entity.  The Fund recognizes that in some"
"1246","cases this procedure may adversely affect the size of the position"
"1247","obtainable for the Series.  In addition, the Fund understands that"
"1248","the persons employed by the Adviser to assist in the performance"
"1249","of the Adviser's duties hereunder will not devote their full time"
"1250","to such service and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to"
"1251","limit or restrict the right of the Adviser or any affiliate of"
"1252","the Adviser to engage in and devote time and attention to other"
"1253","businesses or to render services of whatever kind or nature,"
"1254","provided that doing so does not adversely affect the ability of"
"1255","the Adviser to perform its services under this Agreement."
"1256","8. Term of Agreement"
"1257","            This Agreement shall continue with respect to each"
"1258","Series for an initial two-year period from the commencement date"
"1259","for the Series, specified in Annex I, and thereafter shall"
"1260","continue automatically for successive annual periods, provided"
"1261","such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by"

"1263","(as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Series' outstanding voting"
"1264","securities, provided that in either event the continuance is also"
"1265","approved by a majority of the Board of Trustees who are not"
"1266","interested persons (as defined in said Act) of any party to this"
"1267","Agreement, by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the"
"1268","purpose of voting on such approval.  This Agreement is terminable,"

"1272","by the Adviser.  This Agreement will also terminate automatically"
"1273","in the event of its assignment (as defined in said Act)."
"1274","9. Representation by the Fund"
"1275","            The Fund represents that a copy of its Trust"
"1276","Instrument, dated May 18, 2004, together with all amendments"
"1277","thereto, is on file in the State of Delaware."
"1278","10. Use of Names"
"1279","            The Fund recognizes that directors, officers and"

"1338","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1339","To the Board of Trustees of Credit Suisse Commodity Strategy Funds"
"1340","and the Shareholders of Credit Suisse Commodity Return Strategy Fund:"
"1341","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"1342","Credit Suisse Commodity Return Strategy Fund (a portfolio of Credit"
"1343","Suisse Commodity Strategy Funds) and consolidated Cayman subsidiary"
"1344","(the Fund) as of and for the year ended October 31, 2012, in"
"1345","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting"
"1346","Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund's internal"
"1347","control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"1348","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"1349","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1350","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"1351","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1352","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1353","reporting.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"1354","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1355","reporting."
"1356","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1357","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1358","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1359","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"1360","related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"1361","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"1362","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1363","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"1364","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"1365","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"1366","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"1367","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"1368","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"1369","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"1370","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1371","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"1372","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"1373","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of"
"1374","the fund; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1375","prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use"
"1376","or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a material"
"1377","effect on the financial statements."
"1378","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"1379","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"1380","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"1381","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1382","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the"
"1383","degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"1384","deteriorate."
"1385","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"1386"," when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"1387","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"1388","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"1389","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"1390","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1391","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the fund's"
"1392","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"1393","detected on a timely basis."
"1394","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1395","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"1396","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"1397","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"1398","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"1399","Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted"
"1400","no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial"
"1401","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"1402","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"1403","above as of October 31, 2012."
"1404","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"1405","management and the Board of Trustees of Credit Suisse Opportunity"
"1406","Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not"
"1407","intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"1408","specified parties."

Board of Trustees
Credit Suisse Commodity Return Strategy Fund
1 Madison Ave
New York, New York 10010

Dear Trustees:

We are providing this letter to you for inclusion as an exhibit to your
Form N-SAR filing pursuant to Item 77L.

We have audited the consolidated financial statements included in the
Fund's Annual Report on Form N-CSR for the year ended October 31, 2012
and issued our report thereon dated December 28, 2012.  Note 2 to the
financial statements describes a change in the Fund's basis of
presentation relating to the Fund's investment in a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Fund (the Subsidiary).  The Fund previously
presented its financial statements as a portfolio investment in which
the Fund's investment in the Subsidiary is presented as a single line
item within the Fund's statement of assets and liabilities and the
financial statements of the Subsidiaries accompanied the audited
financial statements of the Fund.

The Fund has changed its methodology to currently consolidate the
financial statements of the Subsidiaries.  It should be understood
that the preferability of one acceptable method of accounting over
another for determining whether to consolidate or utilize a portfolio
investment presentation has not been addressed in any authoritative
accounting literature, and in expressing our concurrence below we have
relied on management's determination that this change in accounting
principle is preferable.  Based on our reading of management's stated
reasons and justification for this change in accounting principle in
Form N-CSR, and our discussions with management as to their judgment
about the relevant business planning factors relating to the change,
we concur with management that such change represents, in the Funds'
circumstances, the adoption of a preferable accounting principle in
conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 250, Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections.

Very truly yours,



PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
