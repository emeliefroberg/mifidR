"584","<TEXT>"
"585","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"586","To the Board of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"587","and the Shareholders of Princeton Futures Strategy Fund"
"588","In planning and performing our audit of the consolidated financial"
"589","statements of Princeton Futures Strategy Fund (the Fund) as of"
"590","and for the year ended March 31, 2012, in accordance with the"
"591","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"592","(United States), we considered the Fund's internal control"
"593","over financial reporting, including controls over"
"594","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"595","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"596","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of"
"597","Form N-SAR, but not for the purposeof expressing an opinion"
"598","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"599","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"600","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"601","maintaining effective internalcontrol over financial reporting."
"602","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments"
"603","by management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"604","related costs of controls.  A fund's internal control over"
"605","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"606","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"607","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes"
"608","in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"609","A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"610","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the"
"611","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately"
"612","and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"613","assets of thefund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that"
"614","transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation"
"615","of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"616","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"617","the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations"
"618","of management and directors of the fund; and (3) provide"
"619","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"620","of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's"
"621","assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"622","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"623","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"624","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"625","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"626","inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree"
"627","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"628","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"629","when the design or operation of a control does not allow management"
"630","or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"631","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"632","A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,"
"633","in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"634","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund's"
"635","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or"
"636","detected on a timely basis."
"637","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"638","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"639","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"640","internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards"
"641","established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"642","(United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"643","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its operation,"
"644","including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider"
"645","to be a material weakness, as defined above, as of March 31, 2012."
"646","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"647","management and the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Princeton"
"648","Futures Strategy Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and"
"649","is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"650","these specified parties."
