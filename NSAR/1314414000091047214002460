"486","To the Shareholders of"

"496","in accordance with the standards"
"497","of the Public Company"
"498","Accounting Oversight Board"
"499","(United States), we considered"
"500","the Fund's internal control over"

"502","controls over safeguarding"
"503","securities, as a basis for designing"
"504","our auditing procedures for the"
"505","purpose of expressing our opinion"
"506","on the financial statements and to"
"507","comply with the requirements of"
"508","Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"509","purpose of expressing an opinion"
"510","on the effectiveness of the Fund's"
"511","internal control over financial"
"512","reporting.  Accordingly, we"
"513","express no such opinion."
"514","The management of the Fund is"

"518","In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"519","estimates and judgments by"
"520","management are required to"
"521","assess the expected benefits and"
"522","related costs of controls.  A"
"523","fund's internal control over"

"528","preparation of financial"
"529","statements for external purposes"
"530","in accordance with generally"
"531","accepted accounting principles"

"537","reasonable detail, accurately and"
"538","fairly reflect the transactions and"
"539","dispositions of the assets of the"
"540","fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"541","assurance that transactions are"

"552","timely detection of unauthorized"
"553","acquisition, use or disposition of"
"554","a fund's assets that could have a"
"555","material effect on the financial"
"556","statements."
"557","Because of its inherent"
"558","limitations, internal control over"
"559","financial reporting may not"

"561","Also, projections of any"

"564","risk that controls may become"
"565","inadequate because of changes in"
"566","conditions, or that the degree of"
"567","compliance with the policies or"
"568","procedures may deteriorate."
"569","A deficiency in internal control"
"570","over financial reporting exists"
"571","when the design or operation of a"

"580","over financial reporting, such that"
"581","there is a reasonable possibility"
"582","that a material misstatement of"

"585","prevented or detected on a timely"
"586","basis."
"587","Our consideration of the Fund's"
