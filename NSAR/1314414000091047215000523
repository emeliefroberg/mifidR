"778","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED"
"779","PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"780","To the Shareholders of Leader Short-Term"
"781","Bond Fund,"
"782","Leader Total Return Fund and Leader"
"783","Global Bond Fund and"
"784","Board of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund"
"785","Trust"
"786","In planning and performing our audits of the"
"787","financial statements of the Leader Short-Term"
"788","Bond Fund, Leader Total Return Fund and"
"789","Leader Global Bond Fund (the Funds), each a"
"790","series of shares of beneficial interest in the"
"791","Northern Lights Fund Trust, as of May 31, 2015"
"792","and for the year and period then ended, in"
"793","accordance with the standards of the Public"
"794","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"795","States) (PCAOB), we considered internal"
"796","control over financial reporting, including"
"797","control activities over safeguarding securities,"
"798","as a basis for designing our auditing"
"799","procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"800","opinion on the financial statements and to"
"801","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR,"
"802","but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"803","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
"804","internal control over financial reporting."
"805","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"806","The management of the Funds is responsible"
"807","for establishing and maintaining effective"
"808","internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"809","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"810","judgments by management are required to"
"811","assess the expected benefits and related costs"
"812","of controls.  A companys internal control over"
"813","financial reporting is a process designed to"
"814","provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"815","reliability of financial reporting and the"
"816","preparation of financial statements for external"
"817","purposes in accordance with accounting"
"818","principles generally accepted in the United"
"819","States of America (GAAP).  A companys"
"820","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"821","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain"
"822","to the maintenance of records that, in"
"823","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"824","the transactions and dispositions of the assets"
"825","of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"826","assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"827","necessary to permit preparation of the financial"
"828","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that"
"829","receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"830","being made only in accordance with"
"831","authorizations of management and trustees of"
"832","the company; and (3) provide reasonable"
"833","assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"834","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"835","disposition of a companys assets that could"
"836","have a material effect on the financial"
"837","statements."
"838","Because of inherent limitations, internal control"
"839","over financial reporting may not prevent or"
"840","detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any"
"841","evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are"
"842","subject to the risk that controls may become"
"843","inadequate because of changes in conditions"
"844","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"845","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"846","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"847","reporting exists when the design or operation"
"848","of a control does not allow management or"
"849","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"850","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"851","misstatements on a timely basis.  A material"
"852","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of"
"853","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"854","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"855","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"856","Funds annual or interim financial statements"
"857","will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"858","basis."
"859","Our consideration of the Funds internal control"
"860","over financial reporting was for the limited"
"861","purpose described in the first paragraph and"
"862","would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies"
"863","in internal control that might be material"
"864","weaknesses under standards established by"
"865","the PCAOB.  However, we noted no"
"866","deficiencies in the internal control over financial"
"867","reporting and its operations, including controls"
"868","over safeguarding securities that we consider"
"869","to be material weaknesses, as defined above,"
"870","as of May 31, 2015."
"871","This report is intended solely for the"
"872","information and use of management, the"
"873","shareholders of the Leader Short-Term Bond"
"874","Fund, Leader Total Return Fund and Leader"
"875","Global Bond Fund, the Board of Trustees of"
"876","Northern Lights Fund Trust and the Securities"
"877","and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"878","to be and should not be used by anyone other"
