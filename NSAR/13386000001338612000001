"855","Accounting Firm"
"856","To the Shareholders and"
"857","Board of Trustees of"
"858","Federated Asset Allocation"
"859","Fund"
"860","In planning and performing"
"861","our audit of the financial"
"862","statements of Federated"
"863","Asset Allocation Fund (the"
"864","?Fund?) (formerly,"
"865","Federated Stock and Bond"
"866","Fund) as of and for the year"
"867","ended November 30, 2011,"
"868","in accordance with the"
"869","standards of the Public"
"870","Company Accounting"
"871","Oversight Board (United"
"872","States), we considered the"
"873","Fund?s internal control over"
"874","financial reporting,"
"875","including controls over"
"876","safeguarding securities, as a"
"877","basis for designing our"
"878","auditing procedures for the"
"879","purpose of expressing our"
"880","opinion on the financial"
"881","statements and to comply"
"882","with the requirements of"
"883","Form N-SAR, but not for"
"884","the purpose of expressing an"
"885","opinion on the effectiveness"
"886","of the Fund?s internal"
"887","control over financial"
"888","reporting. Accordingly, we"
"889","express no such opinion."
"890","Management of the Fund is"
"891","responsible for establishing"
"892","and maintaining effective"
"893","internal control over"
"894","financial reporting. In"
"895","fulfilling this responsibility,"
"896","estimates and judgments by"
"897","management are required to"
"898","assess the expected benefits"
"899","and related costs of"
"900","controls. A company?s"
"901","internal control over"
"902","financial reporting is a"
"903","process designed to provide"
"904","reasonable assurance"
"905","regarding the reliability of"
"906","financial reporting and the"
"907","preparation of financial"
"908","statements for external"
"909","purposes in accordance with"
"910","generally accepted"
"911","accounting principles. A"
"912","company?s internal control"
"913","over financial reporting"
"914","includes those policies and"
"915","procedures that (1) pertain"
"916","to the maintenance of"
"917","records that, in reasonable"
"918","detail, accurately and fairly"
"919","reflect the transactions and"
"920","dispositions of the assets of"
"921","the company; (2) provide"
"922","reasonable assurance that"
"923","transactions are recorded as"
"924","necessary to permit"
"925","preparation of financial"
"926","statements in accordance"
"927","with generally accepted"
"928","accounting principles, and"
"929","that receipts and"
"930","expenditures of the"
"931","company are being made in"
"932","accordance with"
"933","authorizations of"
"934","management and directors"
"935","of the company; and (3)"
"936","provide reasonable"
"937","assurance regarding"
"938","prevention or timely"
"939","detection of the"
"940","unauthorized acquisition,"
"941","use, or disposition of the"
"942","company?s assets that could"
"943","have a material affect on the"
"944","financial statements."
"945","Because of its inherent"
"946","limitations, internal control"
"947","over financial reporting may"
"948","not prevent or detect"
"949","misstatements. Also,"
"950","projections of any"
"951","evaluation of effectiveness"
"952","to future periods are subject"
"953","to the risk that controls may"
"954","become inadequate because"
"955","of changes in conditions, or"
"956","that the degree of"
"957","compliance with the"
"958","policies or procedures may"
"959","deteriorate."
"960","A deficiency in internal"
"961","control over financial"
"962","reporting exists when the"
"963","design or operation of a"
"964","control does not allow"
"965","management or employees,"
"966","in the normal course of"
"967","performing their assigned"
"968","functions, to prevent or"
"969","detect misstatements on a"
"970","timely basis. A material"
"971","weakness is a deficiency, or"
"972","a combination of"
"973","deficiencies, in internal"
"974","control over financial"
"975","reporting, such that there is"
"976","a reasonable possibility that"
"977","a material misstatement of"
"978","the Fund?s annual or interim"
"979","financial statements will not"
"980","be prevented or detected on"
"981","a timely basis."
"982","Our consideration of the"
"983","Fund?s internal control over"
"984","financial reporting was for"
"985","the limited purpose"
"986","described in the first"
"987","paragraph and would not"
"988","necessarily disclose all"
"989","deficiencies in internal"
"990","control that might be"
"991","material weaknesses under"
"992","standards established by the"
"993","Public Company"
"994","Accounting Oversight"
"995","Board (United States)."
"996","However, we noted no"
"997","deficiencies in the Fund?s"
"998","internal control over"
"999","financial reporting and its"
"1000","operation, including"
"1001","controls over safeguarding"
"1002","securities that we consider"
"1003","to be a material weakness as"
"1004","defined above as of"
"1005","November 30, 2011."
"1006","This report is intended"
"1007","solely for the information"
