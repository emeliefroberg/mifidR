In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients."

"6613","</P>"
"6614","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Sub-Adviser may place orders pursuant to its investment determinations for the Fund directly with the issuers of the securities, or with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients."

The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients."

In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the <font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#147;</font>1934 Act<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#148;</font>)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s investment objectives and the policies and procedures that &nbsp;the Adviser notifies the Sub-Adviser the Fund has adopted, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the Sub-Adviser<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s &nbsp;trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board, is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients. &nbsp;The Adviser recognizes that, in some cases, the Sub-Adviser<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s allocation procedure may limit the size of the position that may be acquired or sold for the Portfolio.</p> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; WIDTH:48px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FLOAT:left; FONT-SIZE:11pt><b>4.</b></p> <p style=TEXT-INDENT:-2px; MARGIN:0px; FONT-SIZE:11pt align=justify><b>Books, Records and Regulatory Filings</b></p> <p style=MARGIN:0px; CLEAR:left align=justify><br></p> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:14px align=justify><br><br></p> <p style=MARGIN:0px; FONT-SIZE:12pt>5</p> <p style=LINE-HEIGHT:8pt; MARGIN:0px>#498497</p> <p style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always; MARGIN-TOP:0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:-4pt; FONT-SIZE:4pt /> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:48px; WIDTH:96px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FLOAT:left; FONT-SIZE:11pt>(a)</p> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:14px; FONT-SIZE:11pt align=justify>The Sub-Adviser agrees to maintain and to preserve for the applicable periods any such records as are required to be maintained by the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund by the 1940 Act and rules adopted thereunder, and by any other applicable laws, rules and regulations.

The Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, &nbsp;the &nbsp;Sub-Adviser &nbsp;will &nbsp;consider &nbsp;all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. &nbsp;In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particu lar transaction, and in evaluating the best overall &nbsp;terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research &nbsp;services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &quot;1934 Act&quot;)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that &nbsp;the &nbsp;Sub&#173; Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage &nbsp;and &nbsp;research &nbsp;services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. <FONT style=font-family:Arial>It </FONT>is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule l la2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall &nbsp;not &nbsp;be &nbsp;obligated &nbsp;to, &nbsp;aggregate &nbsp;or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients.</P>"

"7459","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>3.	Brokerage</B>"
"7460","</P>"
"7461","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Sub-Adviser may place orders pursuant to its investment determinations for the Fund directly with the issuers of the securities, or with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients."

In addition, the Sub-Adviser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trust and the Fund from any and all claims, losses, expenses, obligations and liabilities (including reasonable attorney's fees) to which either the Trust or the Fund may become subject directly arising out of or resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty by the Sub-Adviser under Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act with respect to the receipt of compensation for its services under this Agreement.

Nor shall the Sub-Adviser seek satisfaction of any such obligation from the trustees of the Trust (each, a Trustee and, together, the Trustees) or any individual Trustee or any officers."

In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion.

Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions.

"7998","</P>"
"7999","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Sub-Adviser may place orders pursuant to its investment determinations for the Fund directly with the issuers of the securities, or with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients."

In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions.

In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients."

"8814","</P>"
"8815","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Sub-Adviser may place orders pursuant to its investment determinations for the Fund directly with the issuers of the securities, or with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the Sub-Adviser's trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients."

"9094","</P>"
"9095","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Sub-Adviser may place orders pursuant to its investment determinations for the Fund directly with the issuers of the securities, or with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients."

"9367","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>3.	Brokerage</B>"
"9368","</P>"
"9369","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Sub-Adviser may place orders pursuant to its investment determinations for the Fund directly with the issuers of the securities, or with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients."

"9634","</P>"
"9635","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Sub-Adviser may place orders pursuant to its investment determinations for the Fund directly with the issuers of the securities, or with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients."

TEXT-INDENT:48px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:14px; FONT-SIZE:11pt align=justify>The Sub-Adviser may place orders pursuant to its investment determinations for the Fund directly with the issuers of the securities, or with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the <font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#147;</font>1934 Act<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#148;</font>)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s investment objectives and the policies and procedures that &nbsp;the Adviser notifies the Sub-Adviser the Fund has adopted, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the Sub-Adviser<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s &nbsp;trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board, is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients. &nbsp;The Adviser recognizes that, in some cases, the Sub-Adviser<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s allocation procedure may limit the size of the position that may be acquired or sold for the Portfolio.</p> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; WIDTH:48px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FLOAT:left; FONT-SIZE:11pt><b>4.</b></p> <p style=TEXT-INDENT:-2px; MARGIN:0px; FONT-SIZE:11pt align=justify><b>Books, Records and Regulatory Filings</b></p> <p style=MARGIN:0px; CLEAR:left align=justify><br></p> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:14px align=justify><br><br></p> <p style=MARGIN:0px; FONT-SIZE:12pt>5</p> <p style=LINE-HEIGHT:8pt; MARGIN:0px>#498497</p> <p style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always; MARGIN-TOP:0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:-4pt; FONT-SIZE:4pt /> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:48px; WIDTH:96px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FLOAT:left; FONT-SIZE:11pt>(a)</p> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:14px; FONT-SIZE:11pt align=justify>The Sub-Adviser agrees to maintain and to preserve for the applicable periods any such records as are required to be maintained by the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund by the 1940 Act and rules adopted thereunder, and by any other applicable laws, rules and regulations.

"10281","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Sub-Adviser may place orders pursuant to its investment determinations for the Fund directly with the issuers of the securities, or with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser.

The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients."

In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients."

"10819","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Sub-Adviser may place orders pursuant to its investment determinations for the Fund directly with the issuers of the securities, or with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients."

"11098","</P>"
"11099","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Sub-Adviser may place orders pursuant to its investment determinations for the Fund directly with the issuers of the securities, or with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser may open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the Sub-Adviser's trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients."

In addition, the Sub-Adviser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trust and the Fund from any and all claims, losses, expenses, obligations and liabilities (including reasonable attorney's fees) to which either the Trust or the Fund may become subject directly arising out of or resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty by the Sub-Adviser under Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act with respect to the receipt of compensation for its services under this Agreement.

In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion.

It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions.

"11635","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>3.	Brokerage</B>"
"11636","</P>"
"11637","<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Sub-Adviser may place orders pursuant to its investment determinations for the Fund directly with the issuers of the securities, or with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser may, in respect of the Portfolio, open and maintain brokerage accounts of all types on behalf of and in the name of the Fund. The Sub-Adviser may enter into standard customer agreements with brokers and direct payments of cash, cash equivalents and securities and other property into such brokerage accounts as the Sub-Adviser deems desirable or appropriate. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions on behalf of the Fund, the Sub-Adviser will use its best efforts to seek the best overall terms available. In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser's services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the Sub-Adviser's trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser's fiduciary obligations to the Fund and each of its other clients."

In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the <font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#147;</font>1934 Act<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#148;</font>)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the </p> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:14px align=justify><br><br></p> <p style=MARGIN:0px; FONT-SIZE:12pt>5</p> <p style=LINE-HEIGHT:8pt; MARGIN:0px>#498497</p> <p style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always; MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:48px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:14px; FONT-SIZE:11pt align=justify>judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s obligations to the Fund under this Agreement and each of its other clients.</p> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; WIDTH:48px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FLOAT:left; FONT-SIZE:11pt><b>4.</b></p> <p style=TEXT-INDENT:-2px; MARGIN:0px; FONT-SIZE:11pt align=justify><b>Books, Records and Regulatory Filings</b></p> <p style=MARGIN:0px; CLEAR:left align=justify><br></p> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:48px; WIDTH:96px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FLOAT:left; FONT-SIZE:11pt>(a)</p> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:14px; FONT-SIZE:11pt align=justify>The Sub-Adviser agrees to maintain and to preserve for the applicable periods any such records as are required to be maintained by the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund by the 1940 Act and rules adopted thereunder, and by any other applicable laws, rules and regulations.

In assessing the best overall terms available for the Fund transaction, the Sub-Adviser will consider all factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis. In selecting broker-dealers to execute a particular transaction, and in evaluating the best overall terms available, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to consider the brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the <font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#147;</font>1934 Act<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#148;</font>)) provided to the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. The parties hereto acknowledge that it is desirable for the Trust that the Sub-Adviser have access to supplemental investment and market research and security and economic analysis provided by broker-dealers who may execute brokerage transactions at a higher cost to the Fund than may result when allocating brokerage to other brokers on the basis of seeking the most favorable price and efficient execution. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act. It is understood that the services provided by such brokers may be useful to the Sub-Adviser in connection with the Sub-Adviser<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s services to other clients. In accordance with Section 11(a) of the 1934 Act and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder and subject to any other applicable laws and regulations, the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are authorized to effect portfolio transactions for the Fund and to retain brokerage commissions on such transactions. The Sub-Adviser may, but shall not be obligated to, aggregate or bunch orders for the purchase or sale of securities for the Fund with orders for its other clients where: (i) such aggregation or bunching of orders is not inconsistent with the Fund<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s investment objectives, policies and procedures, (ii) the allocation of the securities so purchased or sold, as well as the allocation of expenses incurred in any such transaction, shall be made by the Sub-Adviser in a manner that complies with the trade allocation policies and procedures approved by the Board and is fair and equitable in the </p> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:14px align=justify><br><br></p> <p style=MARGIN:0px; FONT-SIZE:12pt>5</p> <p style=LINE-HEIGHT:8pt; MARGIN:0px>#498497</p> <p style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always; MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:48px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:14px; FONT-SIZE:11pt align=justify>judgment of the Sub-Adviser and is consistent with the Sub-Adviser<font style=FONT-FAMILY:Arial Unicode MS,Times New Roman>&#146;</font>s obligations to the Fund under this Agreement and each of its other clients.</p> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; WIDTH:48px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FLOAT:left; FONT-SIZE:11pt><b>4.</b></p> <p style=TEXT-INDENT:-2px; MARGIN:0px; FONT-SIZE:11pt align=justify><b>Books, Records and Regulatory Filings</b></p> <p style=MARGIN:0px; CLEAR:left align=justify><br></p> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:48px; WIDTH:96px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; FLOAT:left; FONT-SIZE:11pt>(a)</p> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:14px; FONT-SIZE:11pt align=justify>The Sub-Adviser agrees to maintain and to preserve for the applicable periods any such records as are required to be maintained by the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund by the 1940 Act and rules adopted thereunder, and by any other applicable laws, rules and regulations.

Therefore, the Sub-Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that furnishes brokerage and research services a higher commission than that which might be charged by another broker-dealer for effecting the same transaction, provided that the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms </p> <p style=MARGIN-TOP:0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:16px align=justify><br><br></p> <p style=MARGIN:0px; FONT-SIZE:12pt>5</p> <p style=LINE-HEIGHT:10pt; MARGIN:0px>#498497</p> <p style=MARGIN:0px><br></p> <p style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always; MARGIN-TOP:0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM:16px; FONT-SIZE:12pt align=justify>of either the particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Sub-Adviser to the Fund in compliance with Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act.
