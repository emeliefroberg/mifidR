"496","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC"
"497","ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"498","To the Board of Trustees of Lotsoff Capital Management Trust"
"499","and the Shareholders of Lotsoff Capital Management Micro Cap"
"500","Fund"
"501","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"502","Lotsoff Capital Management Micro Cap Fund (the Fund), a series of"
"503","Lotsoff Capital Management Investment Trust, as of and for the year"
"504","ended September 30, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the"
"505","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)"
"506","(PCAOB), we considered its internal control over financial reporting,"
"507","including control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"508","designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our"
"509","opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"510","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"511","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"512","financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"513","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"514","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In"
"515","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management"
"516","are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of"
"517","controls.  A funds internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"518","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of"
"519","financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for"
"520","external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally"
"521","accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  A funds internal"
"522","control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures"
"523","that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,"
"524","accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"525","assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"526","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial"
"527","statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and"
"528","expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with"
"529","authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3)"
"530","provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"531","of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the funds assets that"
"532","could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"533","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"534","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections"
"535","of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the"
"536","risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in"
"537","conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or"
"538","procedures may deteriorate."
"539","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"540","design or operation of a control does not allow management or"
"541","employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned"
"542","functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A"
"543","material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in"
"544","internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"545","possibility that a material misstatement of the Funds annual or interim"
"546","financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely"
"547","basis."
"548","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over financial reporting"
"549","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would"
"550","not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"551","material weaknesses under standards established by the PCAOB."
"552","However, we noted no deficiencies in the internal control over financial"
"553","reporting and its operations, including controls for safeguarding"
"554","securities that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined"
"555","above, as of September 30, 2010."
"556","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"557","management, shareholders and the Board of Trustees of Lotsoff"
"558","Capital Management Investment Trust and the Securities and Exchange"
"559","Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"560","anyone other than these specified parties."

"599","On August  27, 2010, Deloitte & Touche, LLP resigned as the"
"600","independent registered public accounting firm for the Lotsoff"
"601","Capital Management Micro Cap Fund (the Fund). Deloitte &"
"602","Touche, LLP had served as the Funds independent registered"
"603","public accounting firm for the each of the five years in the"
"604","period ended September 30, 2009. Deloitte & Touche, LLP had"
"605","issued a report on the financial statements of the Fund for each"
"606","of those years.  Such reports did not contain adverse opinions"
"607","or disclaimers of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as"
"608","to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles."
"609","During the five most recent fiscal years and through August 27,"
"610","2010, there were no disagreements between the management of"
"611","the Fund and Deloitte & Touche, LLP on any matter of"
"612","accounting principles or practices, financial statement"
"613","disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which"
"614","disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte &"
"615","Touche, LLP, would have caused it to make reference to the"
"616","subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its"
"617","reports on the Funds financial statements for such years."
"618","During the five most recent fiscal years and through August 27,"
"619","2010, none of the events enumerated in paragraphs (1)(v)(A)"
"620","through (D) of Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K occurred."
"621","On August 27, 2010, 2010, the Funds Board of Trustees"
"622","engaged the firm of BBD, LLP to serve as the new independent"
"623","registered public accounting firm to the Fund. During the five"
"624","most recent fiscal years and through August 27, 2010, the Funds"
"625","management did not consult BBD, LLP regarding either (i) the"
"626","application of accounting principles to a specified transaction,"
"627","either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that"
"628","might be rendered on the Funds financial statements, or (ii) any"
"629","matter that was either the subject of a disagreement or a"
"630","reportable event, as such terms are defined in Item 304 of"
"631","Regulation S-K."
"632","The Fund has provided Deloitte & Touche, LLP with a copy of"
"633","these disclosures and has requested that Deloitte & Touche,"
"634","LLP furnish the Fund with a letter addressed to the Commission"
