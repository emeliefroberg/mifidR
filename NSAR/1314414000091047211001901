"482","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"483","To the Board of Trustees of Northern Lights Fund Trust"
"484","and the Shareholders of Biltmore Index Enhancing Fund,"
"485","Arrow DWA Balanced Fund, Autopilot Managed Growth Fund"
"486","Changing Parameters Fund and The Alpha Fund"
"487","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of"
"488","Biltmore Index Enhancing Fund, Arrow DWA Balanced Fund, Autopilot Managed"
"489","Growth Fund, Changing Parameters Fund and The Alpha Fund (collectively,"
"490","the Funds), each a series of beneficial interest of the Northern Lights"
"491","Fund Trust, as of July 31, 2007 and for the period then ended, in"
"492","accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"493","Board (United States), we considered their internal control over financial"
"494","reporting, including control activities for safeguarding securities, as a"
"495","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"496","our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"497","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"498","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial reporting."
"499","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"500","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"501","effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this"
"502","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess"
"503","the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A company's internal"
"504","control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"505","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"506","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting"
"507","principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Such internal"
"508","control includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance"
"509","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or"
"510","disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the"
"511","financial statements."
"512","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"513","may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation"
"514","of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may"
"515","become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of"
"516","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"517","A control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does"
"518","not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"519","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis."
"520","A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,"
"521","in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a"
"522","material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those"
"523","responsible for oversight of the funds financial reporting.  A material"
"524","weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control"
"525","over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"526","material misstatement of the funds annual or interim financial statements"
"527","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"528","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"529","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"530","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be"
"531","significant deficiencies or material weaknesses under standards established"
"532","by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However,"
"533","we noted no deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting"
"534","and its operations, including controls for safeguarding securities that we"
"535","consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above, as of July 31, 2007."
"536","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management"
"537","and the Board of Trustees of the Northern Lights Fund Trust, the shareholders"
"538","of Biltmore Index Enhancing Fund, Arrow DWA Balanced Fund, Autopilot Managed"
"539","Growth Fund, Changing Parameters Fund and The Alpha Fund, and the Securities"
"540","and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by"
"541","anyone other than these specified parties."
