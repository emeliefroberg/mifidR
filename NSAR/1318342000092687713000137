"1811","April 30, 2013, in accordance with the standards of"
"1812","the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board"
"1813","(United States), we considered their internal control"
"1814","over financial reporting, including control activities"
"1815","for safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1816","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing"
"1817","our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"1818","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"1819","not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1820","effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"1821","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"1822","opinion."
"1823","The management of the Fund is responsible for"
"1824","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"1825","over financial reporting.   In fulfilling this"
"1826","responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"1827","management are required to assess the expected"
"1828","benefits and related costs of controls.   A companys"
"1829","internal control over financial reporting is a process"
"1830","designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"1831","the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1832","preparation of financial statements for external"
"1833","purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"1834","accounting principles.   A companys internal control"

"1837","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and"
"1838","fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the"
"1839","assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable"
"1840","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary"
"1841","to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1842","accordance with generally accepted accounting"

"1850","the financial statements."
"1851","Because of inherent limitations, internal control over"

"1868","companys annual or interim financial statements will"
"1869","not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1870","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"1871","financial reporting was for the limited purpose"
"1872","described in the first paragraph and would not"

"1874","that might be material weaknesses under standards"
