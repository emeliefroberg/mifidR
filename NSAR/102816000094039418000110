"1612","we considered the Fund's internal control over financial reporting,"
"1613","including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"1614","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1615","financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-"

"1617","effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting."
"1618","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"1619","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"1620","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling"
"1621","this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are"
"1622","required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls. A"

"1624","provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial"
"1625","reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external"
"1626","purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles."
"1627","A fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies"
"1628","and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in"
"1629","reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and"

"2377","with Eaton Vance Growth Trust, a Massachusetts business trust (the"
"2378","Trust) on behalf of Eaton Vance International Small-Cap Fund (the"

"2383","responsibilities under the Advisory Agreement to one or more sub-"
"2384","investment advisers; and"
"2385","	WHEREAS, the Adviser and the Trustees of the Trust desire"
"2386","to retain the Sub-Adviser to render portfolio management services to"
"2387","the Fund in the manner and on the terms set forth in this Agreement;"
"2388","	NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants"
"2389","and agreements set forth herein, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser"
"2390","agree as follows:"
"2391","	1.	Duties of the Sub-Adviser.  The Adviser hereby"
"2392","employs the Sub-Adviser to act as investment adviser for and to"
"2393","manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the Fund"
"2394","and to administer its investment affairs, subject to the supervision of"
"2395","the Adviser and the Trustees of the Trust, for the period and on the"
"2396","terms set forth in this Agreement."
"2397","	(a)	The Sub-Adviser hereby accepts such employment"
"2398","and undertakes to afford to the Fund the advice and assistance of the"
"2399","Sub-Adviser's organization in the choice of investments and in the"
"2400","purchase and sale of securities for the Fund and to furnish, for the"
"2401","use of the Fund, office space and all necessary office facilities,"
"2402","equipment and personnel for servicing the investments of the Fund"
"2403","and for administering its investment affairs and to pay the salaries"
"2404","and fees of all officers and Trustees of the Trust who are members of"
"2405","the Sub-Adviser's organization and all personnel of the Sub-Adviser"
"2406","performing services relating to research and investment activities."
"2407","The Sub-Adviser shall for all purposes herein be deemed to be an"
"2408","independent contractor and shall, except as otherwise expressly"
"2409","provided or authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the"
"2410","Adviser or the Fund in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of"
"2411","the Adviser or the Fund."
"2412","	(b)	The Sub-Adviser shall provide the Fund with such"
"2413","investment management and supervision as the Fund may, from time"
"2414","to time, consider necessary for the proper supervision of the Fund."
"2415","As investment adviser to the Fund, the Sub-Adviser shall furnish"
"2416","continuously an investment program and shall determine, from time to"
"2417","time, what securities and other investments shall be acquired,"
"2418","disposed of or exchanged and what portion of the Fund's assets shall"
"2419","be held uninvested, subject always to the applicable restrictions of the"
"2420","Trust's Declaration of Trust, By-Laws and Registration Statement"
"2421","under the Investment Company Act of 1940, all as from time to time"
"2422","amended.  The Sub-Adviser is authorized, in its discretion and"
"2423","without prior consultation with the Adviser or the Fund, to buy, sell,"
"2424","and otherwise trade in any and all types of securities and investment"
"2425","instruments on behalf of the Fund.  Should the Trustees of the Trust"
"2426","at any time, however, make any specific determination as to"
"2427","investment policy for the Fund and notify the Sub-Adviser thereof in"
"2428","writing, the Sub-Adviser shall be bound by such determination for the"
"2429","period, if any, specified in such notice or until similarly notified that"
"2430","such determination has been revoked.  The Sub-Adviser shall take,"
"2431","on behalf of the Fund, all actions that it deems necessary or desirable"
"2432","to implement the investment policies of the Fund."
"2433","	(c)	The Sub-Adviser shall place orders for the purchase"
"2434","or sale of portfolio securities for the account of the Fund either directly"
"2435","with the issuer or with brokers or dealers selected by the Sub-Adviser,"
"2436","and, to that end, the Sub-Adviser is authorized as the agent of the"
"2437","Fund to give instructions to the custodian of the Fund as to deliveries"
"2438","of securities and payments of cash for the account of the Fund.  In"
"2439","connection with the selection of such brokers or dealers and the"
"2440","placing of such orders, the Sub-Adviser shall use its best efforts to"
"2441","seek to execute security transactions at prices that are advantageous"
"2442","to the Fund and (when a disclosed commission is being charged) at"
"2443","reasonably competitive commission rates, and in accordance with"
"2444","procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Trust."
"2445","	(d)	The Sub-Adviser shall furnish such reports,"
"2446","evaluations, information or analyses to the Fund and the Adviser as"
"2447","the Trust's Board of Trustees or the Adviser may reasonably request"
"2448","from time to time, or as the Sub-Adviser may deem to be desirable."
"2449","	2.	Compensation of the Sub-Adviser.  For the services,"
"2450","payments and facilities to be furnished hereunder by the Sub-Adviser,"
"2451","to the extent the Adviser receives at least such amount from the Fund"
"2452","pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall be entitled"
"2453","to receive from the Adviser an annual fee equal to the amount"
"2454","specified in Schedule A hereto, payable monthly in arrears on the last"
"2455","business day of each month.  The Fund's daily net assets shall be"
"2456","computed in accordance with the Declaration of Trust of the Trust and"
"2457","any applicable votes and determinations of the Trustees of the Trust."
"2458","In case of initiation or termination of the Agreement during any month"
"2459","with respect to the Fund, the fee for that month shall be based on the"
"2460","number of calendar days during which it is in effect.  The Sub-Adviser"
"2461","may, from time to time, waive all or a part of the above compensation."
"2462","	3.	Allocation of Charges and Expenses.  It is"
"2463","understood that, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Fund will"
"2464","pay all expenses other than those expressly stated to be payable by"
