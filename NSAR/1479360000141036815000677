"3199","<TEXT>"
"3200","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"3201","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of PIMCO Equity"
"3202","Series:"
"3203","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"3204","statements of PIMCO Equity Series (the Funds) as of and for"
"3205","the year ended June 30,2014, in accordance with the standards"
"3206","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United"
"3207","States), we considered the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3208","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a"
"3209","basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"3210","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to"
"3211","comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"3212","purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the"
"3213","Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"3214","do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds'"
"3215","internal control over financial reporting."
"3216","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and"
"3217","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In"
"3218","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"3219","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"3220","related costs of controls. A company's internal control over"
"3221","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"3222","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the"
"3223","preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"3224","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A"
"3225","company's internal control over financial reporting includes"
"3226","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"3227","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"3228","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;"
"3229","(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded"
"3230","as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"3231","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"3232","that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made"
"3233","only in accordance with authorizations of management and"
"3234","trustees of the company ; and (3) provide reasonable assurance"
"3235","regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized"
"3236","acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could"
"3237","have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3238","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial"
"3239","reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,"
"3240","projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"3241","are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate"
"3242","because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of"
"3243","compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3244","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"3245","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"3246","management or employees, in the normal course of performing"
"3247","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"3248","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"3249","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"3250","reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a"
"3251","material misstatement of the Funds' annual or interim financial"
"3252","statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"3253","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3254","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"3255","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"3256","internal control over financial reporting that might be material"
"3257","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"3258","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted"
"3259","no deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3260","reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding"
"3261","securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as defined"
"3262","above as of June 30, 2014."

"3381","Laws shall be subject to the Declaration of Trust, as amended"
"3382","from time to time (Declaration of Trust), of PIMCO Equity"
"3383","Series, a Delaware statutory trust (Trust).  In the event of any"
"3384","inconsistency between the terms hereof and the terms of the"
"3385","Declaration of Trust, the terms of the Declaration of Trust shall"
"3386","control."
"3387","             Section 2.  Definitions.  Capitalized terms used"
"3388","herein and not herein defined are used as defined in the"
"3389","Declaration of Trust."
"3390","ARTICLE II"
"3391","Offices"
"3392","             Section 1.  Principal Office.  The principal"
"3393","executive office of the Trust shall be located in Newport Beach,"
"3394","California, until such time as the Trustees may change the"
"3395","location of the principal executive office of the Trust to any"
"3396","other place."
"3397","             Section 2.  Delaware Office.  The Trustees shall"
"3398","establish a registered office in the State of Delaware and shall"
"3399","appoint as the Trust's registered agent for service of process in"
"3400","the State of Delaware an individual who is a resident of the State"
"3401","of Delaware or a Delaware corporation or a corporation"
"3402","authorized to transact business in the State of Delaware; in each"
"3403","case the business office of such registered agent for service of"
"3404","process shall be identical with the registered Delaware office of"
"3405","the Trust.  The Trustees may designate a successor resident"
"3406","agent, provided, however, that such appointment shall not"
"3407","become effective until written notice thereof is delivered to the"
"3408","Office of the Secretary of the State of Delaware."
"3409","             Section 3.  Other Offices.  The Trustees may at"
"3410","any time establish branch or subordinate offices at any place or"

"3413","ARTICLE III"
"3414","Meetings of Shareholders"
"3415","             Section 1.  Place of Meetings.  Meetings of"
"3416","Shareholders shall be held at any place designated by the"
"3417","Trustees.  In the absence of any such designation, Shareholders'"
"3418","meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the"
"3419","Trust."
"3420","             Section 2.  Call of Meetings.  There shall be no"
"3421","annual meetings of Shareholders except as required by law."
"3422","Special meetings of the Shareholders of the Trust or of any"
"3423","Series or Class may be called at any time by the Trustees or by"
"3424","the President or the Secretary for the purpose of taking action"
"3425","upon any matter requiring the vote or authority of the"
"3426","Shareholders of the Trust or of any Series or Class as herein"
"3427","provided or provided in the Declaration of Trust or upon any"
"3428","other matter as to which such vote or authority is deemed by the"
"3429","Trustees or the President to be necessary or desirable.  Meetings"
"3430","of the Shareholders of the Trust or of any Series or Class may be"
"3431","called for any purpose deemed necessary or desirable upon the"
"3432","written request of the Shareholders holding at least ten percent"
"3433","(10%) of the Outstanding Shares of the Trust entitled to vote at"
"3434","such meeting, provided that (1) such request shall state the"
"3435","purposes of such meeting and the matters proposed to be acted"
"3436","on, and (2) the Shareholders requesting such meeting shall have"
"3437","paid to the Trust the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and"
"3438","mailing the notice thereof, which the Secretary shall determine"
"3439","and specify to such Shareholders.  If the Secretary fails for more"
"3440","than thirty (30) days to call a special meeting, the Trustees or the"
"3441","Shareholders requesting such a meeting may, in the name of the"
"3442","Secretary, call the meeting by giving the required notice.  If the"
"3443","meeting is a meeting of Shareholders of any Series or Class, but"
"3444","not a meeting of all Shareholders of the Trust, then only a special"
"3445","meeting of Shareholders of such Series or Class need be called"
"3446","and, in such case, only Shareholders of such Series or Class shall"
"3447","be entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting."
"3448","             Section 3.  Notice of Meetings of Shareholders."
"3449","All notices of meetings of Shareholders shall be sent or"
"3450","otherwise given to Shareholders in accordance with Section 4 of"
"3451","this Article III not less than ten (10) nor more than ninety (90)"
"3452","days before the date of the meeting.  The notice shall specify"
"3453","(i) the place, date and hour of the meeting, and (ii) the general"
"3454","nature of the business to be transacted."
"3455","             Section 4.  Manner of Giving Notice; Affidavit"
"3456","of Notice."
"3457","                    (a)	Notice of any meeting of"
"3458","Shareholders shall be (i) given either by hand delivery, first-class"
"3459","mail, telegraphic or other written or electronic communication,"
"3460","charges prepaid, and (ii) addressed to the Shareholder at the"
"3461","address of that Shareholder appearing on the books of the Trust"
"3462","or its transfer agent or given by the Shareholder to the Trust for"
"3463","the purpose of notice.  If no such address appears on the Trust's"
"3464","books or is not given to the Trust, or to the Trust's transfer or"
"3465","similar agent, notice shall be deemed to be waived and therefore"
"3466","unnecessary, unless and until the Shareholder provides the Trust,"
"3467","or the Trust's transfer or similar agent, with his or her address."
"3468","Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when"
"3469","delivered personally or deposited in the mail or sent by telegram"
"3470","or other means of written or electronic communication or, where"
"3471","notice is given by publication, on the date of publication."
"3472","Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be"
"3473","given effectively to Shareholders, any notice to Shareholders"
"3474","given by the Trust shall be effective if given by a single written"
"3475","notice to Shareholders who share an address if consented to by"
"3476","the Shareholders at that address."
"3477","                    (b)	If any notice addressed to a"
"3478","Shareholder at the address of that Shareholder appearing on the"
"3479","books of the Trust is returned to the Trust by the United States"
"3480","Postal Service marked to indicate that the Postal Service is"
"3481","unable to deliver the notice to the Shareholder at that address, all"
"3482","future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given"
"3483","without further mailing if such future notices or reports shall be"
"3484","kept available to the Shareholder, upon written demand of the"
"3485","Shareholder, at the principal executive office of the Trust for a"
"3486","period of one year from the date of the giving of the notice."
"3487","                    (c)	An affidavit of the mailing or"
"3488","other means of giving any notice of any meeting of Shareholders"
"3489","shall be filed and maintained in the minute book of the Trust."
"3490","             Section 5.  Conduct of Meetings of"
"3491","Shareholders.  The meetings of Shareholders shall be presided"
"3492","over by the President, or if he or she is not present, by any Vice"
"3493","President, unless there is an Executive Vice President, or if none"
"3494","of them is present, then any officer of the Trust appointed by the"
"3495","President to act on his or her behalf shall preside over such"
"3496","meetings.  The Secretary, if present, shall act as a Secretary of"
"3497","such meetings, or if he or she is not present or is otherwise"
"3498","presiding over the meeting in another capacity, an Assistant"
"3499","Secretary, if any, shall so act.  If neither the Secretary nor the"
"3500","Assistant Secretary is present or, if present, the Secretary is"
"3501","otherwise presiding over the meeting in another capacity, then"
"3502","any such person appointed by the Secretary to act on his or her"
"3503","behalf shall act as Secretary of such meetings."
"3504","             Section 6.  Adjourned Meeting; Notice.  Any"
"3505","meeting of Shareholders, whether or not a quorum is present,"
"3506","may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of"
"3507","the Shares represented at the meeting, either in person or by"
"3508","proxy.  Notwithstanding the above, broker non-votes will be"
"3509","excluded from the denominator of the calculation of the number"
"3510","of votes required to approve any proposal to adjourn a meeting."
"3511","Notice of adjournment of a Shareholders' meeting to another"
"3512","time or place need not be given, if such time and place are"
"3513","announced at the meeting at which adjournment is taken and the"
"3514","adjourned meeting is held within a reasonable time after the date"
"3515","set for the original meeting.  If the adjournment is for more than"
"3516","sixty (60) days from the date set for the original meeting or a"
"3517","new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of any"
"3518","such adjourned meeting shall be given to each Shareholder of"
"3519","record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance"
"3520","with the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this Article III.  At any"
"3521","adjourned meeting, the Trust may transact any business which"
"3522","might have been transacted at the original meeting."
"3523","             Section 7.  Voting.  The Shareholders entitled to"
"3524","vote at any meeting of Shareholders shall be determined in"
"3525","accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the"
"3526","Trust, as in effect as of such time.  The Shareholders' vote may"
"3527","be by voice vote or by ballot; provided, however, that any"
"3528","election for Trustees must be by ballot if demanded by any"
"3529","Shareholder before the voting has begun.  On any matter other"
"3530","than election of Trustees, any Shareholder may cast part of the"
"3531","votes that such Shareholder is entitled to cast in favor of the"
"3532","proposal and refrain from casting and/or cast the remaining part"
"3533","of such votes against the proposal; but if such Shareholder fails"
"3534","to specify the number of votes that such Shareholder is casting in"
"3535","favor of the proposal, it will be conclusively presumed that such"
"3536","Shareholder is casting all of the votes that such Shareholder is"
"3537","entitled to cast in favor of such proposal."
"3538","             Section 8.  Waiver of Notice; Consent of Absent"
"3539","Shareholders."
"3540","                    (a)	The transaction of business and"
"3541","any actions taken at a meeting of Shareholders, however called"
"3542","and noticed and wherever held, shall be as valid as though taken"
"3543","at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice provided a"
"3544","quorum is present either in person or by proxy at the meeting of"
"3545","Shareholders and if either before or after the meeting, each"
"3546","Shareholder entitled to vote who was not present in person or by"
"3547","proxy at the meeting of the Shareholders signs a written waiver"
"3548","of notice or a consent to a holding of the meeting or an approval"
"3549","of the minutes.  The waiver of notice or consent need not specify"
"3550","either the business to be transacted or the purpose of any meeting"
"3551","of Shareholders."
"3552","                    (b)	Attendance by a Shareholder at"
"3553","a meeting of Shareholders shall also constitute a waiver of notice"
"3554","of that meeting, except if the Shareholder objects at the"
"3555","beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business"
"3556","because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and"
"3557","except that attendance at a meeting of Shareholders is not a"
"3558","waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters not"
"3559","included in the notice of the meeting of Shareholders if that"
"3560","objection is expressly made at the beginning of the meeting."
"3561","             Section 9.  Shareholder Action by Written"
"3562","Consent Without a Meeting."
"3563","                    (a)	Except as provided in the"
"3564","Declaration of Trust, any action that may be taken at any"
"3565","meeting of Shareholders may be taken without a meeting and"
"3566","without prior notice if a consent or consents in writing setting"
"3567","forth the action to be taken is signed by the holders of"
"3568","Outstanding Shares having not less than the minimum number of"
"3569","votes that would be necessary to authorize or take that action at a"
"3570","meeting at which all Shares entitled to vote on that action were"
"3571","present and voted provided, however, that the Shareholders"
"3572","receive any necessary Information Statement or other necessary"
"3573","documentation in conformity with the requirements of the"
"3574","Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the rules or regulations"
"3575","thereunder.  Any such written consent may be executed and"
"3576","given by facsimile or other electronic means.  All such consents"
"3577","shall be filed with the Secretary of the Trust and shall be"
"3578","maintained in the Trust's records.  Any Shareholder giving a"
"3579","written consent, a transferee of the Shares, a personal"
"3580","representative of the Shareholder, or their respective proxy"
"3581","holders may revoke the Shareholder's written consent by a"
"3582","writing received by the Secretary of the Trust before written"
"3583","consents of the number of Outstanding Shares required to"
"3584","authorize the proposed action have been filed with the Secretary."
"3585","                    (b)	If the consents of all"
"3586","Shareholders entitled to vote have not been solicited in writing"
"3587","and if the unanimous written consent of all such Shareholders"
"3588","shall not have been received, the Secretary shall give prompt"
"3589","notice of the action approved by the Shareholders without a"
"3590","meeting.  This notice shall be given in the manner specified in"
"3591","Section 4 of this Article III to each Shareholder entitled to vote"
"3592","who did not execute such written consent."
"3593","             Section 10.  Record Date for Shareholder"
"3594","Notice, Voting and Giving Consents."
"3595","                    (a)	For purposes of determining the"
"3596","Shareholders entitled to vote or act at any meeting or"
"3597","adjournment or postponement thereof, the Trustees may fix in"
"3598","advance a record date which shall not be more than sixty (60)"
"3599","days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such"
"3600","meeting.  Without fixing a record date for a meeting, the"
"3601","Trustees may for voting and notice purposes close the register or"
"3602","transfer books for one or more Series (or Classes) for all or any"
"3603","part of the period between the earliest date on which a record"
"3604","date for such meeting could be set in accordance herewith and"
"3605","the date of such meeting.  If the Trustees do not so fix a record"
"3606","date or close the register or transfer books of the affected Series"
"3607","or Classes, the record date for determining Shareholders entitled"
"3608","to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders shall be the"
"3609","close of business on the business day next preceding the day on"
"3610","which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of"
"3611","business on the business day next preceding the day on which"
"3612","the meeting is held."
"3613","                    (b)	The record date for determining"
"3614","Shareholders entitled to give consent to action in writing without"
"3615","a meeting, (a) when no prior action of the Trustees has been"
"3616","taken, shall be the day on which the first written consent is"
"3617","given, or (b) when prior action of the Trustees has been taken,"
"3618","shall be (i) such date as determined for that purpose by the"
"3619","Trustees, which record date shall not precede the date upon"
"3620","which the resolution fixing it is adopted by the Trustees and shall"
"3621","not be more than twenty (20) days after the date of such"
"3622","resolution, or (ii) if no record date is fixed by the Trustees, the"
"3623","record date shall be the close of business on the day on which the"
"3624","Trustees adopt the resolution relating to that action."
"3625","                    (c)	Nothing in this Section shall be"
"3626","construed as precluding the Trustees from setting different"
"3627","record dates for different Series or Classes.  Only Shareholders"
"3628","of record on the record date, as herein determined, shall have any"
"3629","right to vote or to act at any meeting or give consent to any"
"3630","action relating to such record date, notwithstanding any transfer"
"3631","of Shares on the books of the Trust after such record date."
"3632","             Section 11.  Proxies.  Subject to the provisions"
"3633","of the Declaration of Trust, Shareholders entitled to vote for"
"3634","Trustees or on any other matter shall have the right to do so"
"3635","either in person or by proxy, provided that either (i) a written"
"3636","instrument authorizing such a proxy to act is executed by the"
"3637","Shareholder or his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact and"
"3638","dated not more than eleven (11) months before the meeting,"
"3639","unless the instrument specifically provides for a longer period, or"
"3640","(ii) the Trustees adopt an electronic, telephonic, computerized or"
"3641","other alternative to the execution of a written instrument"
"3642","authorizing the proxy to act, and such authorization is received"
"3643","not more than eleven (11) months before the meeting.  A proxy"
"3644","shall be deemed executed by a Shareholder if the Shareholder's"
"3645","name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature,"
"3646","typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the"
"3647","Shareholder or the Shareholder's attorney-in-fact.  A valid proxy"
"3648","which does not state that it is irrevocable shall continue in full"
"3649","force and effect unless (i) revoked by the Person executing it"
"3650","before the vote pursuant to that proxy is taken, (a) by a writing"
"3651","delivered to the Trust stating that the proxy is revoked, or (b) by"
"3652","a subsequent proxy executed by such Person, or (c) attendance at"
"3653","the meeting and voting in person by the Person executing that"
"3654","proxy, or (d) revocation by such Person using any electronic,"
"3655","telephonic, computerized or other alternative means authorized"
"3656","by the Trustees for authorizing the proxy to act; or (ii) written"
"3657","notice of the death or incapacity of the maker of that proxy is"
"3658","received by the Trust before the vote pursuant to that proxy is"
"3659","counted.  A proxy with respect to Shares held in the name of two"
"3660","or more Persons shall be valid if executed by any one of them"
"3661","unless at or prior to exercise of the proxy the Trust receives a"
"3662","specific written notice to the contrary from any one of the two or"
"3663","more Persons.  A proxy purporting to be executed by or on"
"3664","behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged"
"3665","at or prior to its exercise and the burden of proving invalidity"
"3666","shall rest on the challenger.  Unless otherwise specifically"
"3667","limited by their terms, proxies shall entitle the Shareholder to"
"3668","vote at any adjournment or postponement of a Shareholders'"
"3669","meeting.  At every meeting of Shareholders, unless the voting is"
"3670","conducted by inspectors, all questions concerning the"
