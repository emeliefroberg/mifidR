"402","            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"403","SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF TRUSTEES"
"404","SHELTON GREATER CHINA FUND"
"405","SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA"
"406","In  planning and performing our audit of Shelton Greater China Fund (the Fund)"
"407","as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, in accordance with the standards"
"408","of  the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"409","its  internal control over financial reporting, including control activities for"
"410","safeguarding  securities,  as  a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"411","the  purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply"
"412","with  the  requirements  of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"413","opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  Fund's internal control over financial"
"414","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"415","The  management  of  the  Fund  is  responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"416","effective   internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  In  fulfilling  this"
"417","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"418","expected  benefits  and  related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"419","over  financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"420","regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of"
"421","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"422","accounting  principles.  A  company's  internal control over financial reporting"
"423","includes  those  policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"424","records   that,   in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the"
"425","transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2) provide"
"426","reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as necessary to permit"
"427","preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally accepted"
"428","accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts and expenditures of the company are"
"429","being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of"
"430","the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"431","detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets"
"432","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"433","Because  of  inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may"
"434","not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"435","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"436","inadequate  because  of  changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"437","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"438","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"439","or  operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"440","course   of   performing   their   assigned  functions,  to  prevent  or  detect"
"441","misstatements  on  a  timely  basis.  A  material  weakness  is a deficiency, or"
"442","combination  of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"443","that  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that a material misstatement of the"
"444","company's  annual  or  interim  financial  statements  will  not be prevented or"
"445","detected on a timely basis."

"450","Our  consideration  of  the Fund's internal control over financial reporting was"
"451","for  the  limited  purpose  described  in  the  first  paragraph  and  would not"
"452","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"453","weaknesses   under  standards  established  by  the  Public  Company  Accounting"
"454","Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund's"
"455","internal  control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls"
"456","for  safeguarding  securities,  which  we consider to be material weaknesses, as"
"457","defined above, as of December 31, 2013."
"458","This  report is intended solely for the information and use of management, Board"
"459","of  Trustees  of  Shelton  Greater  China  Fund  and the Securities and Exchange"

"461","than these specified parties."
