"3325","In planning and performing our audit of the"

"3327","Bernstein Equity Strategy Fund (the Fund)"
"3328","(one of the funds constituting Eaton Vance"

"3330","August 31, 2014, in accordance with the"

"3336","basis for designing our auditing procedures"
"3337","for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"

"3340","for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"3341","the effectiveness of the Fund's internal"
"3342","control over financial reporting."
"3343","Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3344","The management of the Fund is responsible"
"3345","for establishing and maintaining effective"

"3347","fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"3348","judgments by management are required to"
"3349","assess the expected benefits and related"
"3350","costs of controls.  A fund's internal control"

"3354","reporting and the preparation of financial"
"3355","statements for external purposes in"
"3356","accordance with generally accepted"

"3374","acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's"
"3375","assets that could have a material effect on"
"3376","the financial statements."
"3377","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"

"3382","the risk that controls may become"
"3383","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"3384","or that the degree of compliance with the"
