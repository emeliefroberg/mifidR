"1382","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"1383","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of"
"1384","MFS Diversified Income Fund"
"1385","In planning and performing  our audit of the financial statements of MFS Diver"
"1386","sified Income Fund (the Fund) as of and for the year ended  February 28, 2011,"
"1387","in accordance  with the  standards of the Public  Company  Accounting Oversigh"
"1388","t Board (United States),  we considered the Funds internal  control over finan"
"1389","cial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1390","designing our auditing  procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on"
"1391","the financial statements and to comply with the  requirements of Form N-SAR, but"
"1392","not for the  purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds"
"1393","internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opini"
"1394","on."
"1395","The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1396","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsi"
"1397","bility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expecte"
"1398","d benefits and related costs of controls. A companys internal control over finan"
"1399","cial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding t"
"1400","he reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statement"
"1401","s for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting princip"
"1402","les. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policie"
"1403","s and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonab"
"1404","le detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of th"
"1405","e assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are"
"1406","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordanc"
"1407","e with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditu"
"1408","res of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of mana"
"1409","gement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regard"
"1410","ing prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or dispositi"
"1411","on of a companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial state"
"1412","ments."
"1413","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"1414","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"1415","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1416","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance wi"
"1417","th the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1418","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"1419","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"1420","course of performing  their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatemen"
"1421","ts on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of d"
"1422","eficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"1423","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or in"
"1424","terim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"1425","Our  consideration of the Funds internal control over financial  reporting was"
"1426","for the limited purpose  described in the first  paragraph  and would not  neces"
"1427","sarily  disclose all  deficiencies  in internal  control that might be material"
"1428","weaknesses under standards  established by the Public Company Accounting  Oversi"
"1429","ght Board (United States). However,  we noted no  deficiencies  in the Funds int"
"1430","ernal control over financial reporting and its operation,including controls over"
"1431","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness as de"
"1432","fined above as of February 28, 2011."
