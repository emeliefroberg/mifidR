"930","             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"931","To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of AIM Investment Funds"
"932","(Invesco Investment Funds):"
"933","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Invesco Van"
"934","Kampen International Growth Fund and Invesco Van Kampen International Advantage"
"935","Fund (formerly known as Van Kampen International Growth Fund and Van Kampen"
"936","International Advantage Fund, respectively; two of the funds constituting AIM"
"937","Investment Funds (Invesco Investment Funds), hereafter referred to as the"
"938","Funds) as of and for the period ended August 31, 2010, in accordance with the"
"939","standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"940","considered the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including"
"941","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing"
"942","procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements"
"943","and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of"
"944","expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over"
"945","financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the"
"946","effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting."
"947","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"948","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"949","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"950","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"951","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"952","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"953","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"954","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"955","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"956","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"957","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"958","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"959","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"960","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"961","in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and"
"962","(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of"
"963","unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund's assets that could have"
"964","a material effect on the financial statements."
"965","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"966","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"967","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"968","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"969","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"970","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"971","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"972","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"973","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"974","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"975","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"976","Funds' annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"977","on a timely basis."
"978","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"979","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"980","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"981","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"982","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"983","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"984","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"985","be material weaknesses as defined above as of August 31, 2010."
"986","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the"
"987","Board of Trustees of the Funds and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"988","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified"
"989","parties."

"1052","SETTLED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO MARKET TIMING"
"1053","          On October 8, 2004, Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Invesco), successor by"
"1054","merger to Invesco Aim Advisors, Inc. and INVESCO Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), both"
"1055","former investment advisers, along with Invesco Aim Distributors, n/k/a Invesco"
"1056","Distributors, Inc. (Invesco Distributors) reached final settlements with certain"
"1057","regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York"
"1058","Attorney General and the Colorado Attorney General, to resolve civil enforcement"
"1059","actions and/or investigations related to market timing and related activity in"
"1060","the AIM Funds (n/k/a the Invesco Funds), including those formerly advised by"
"1061","IFG. As part of the settlements, a $325 million fair fund ($110 million of which"
"1062","is civil penalties) was created to compensate shareholders harmed by market"
"1063","timing and related activity in funds formerly advised by IFG. Additionally,"
"1064","Invesco and Invesco Distributors created a $50 million fair fund ($30 million of"
"1065","which is civil penalties) to compensate shareholders harmed by market timing and"
"1066","related activity in funds advised by Invesco, which was done pursuant to the"
"1067","terms of the settlement. The methodology of the fair funds distributions was"
"1068","determined by Invesco's independent distribution consultant (IDC Plan), in"
"1069","consultation with Invesco and the independent trustees of the Invesco Funds, and"
"1070","approved by the SEC on May 23, 2008."
"1071","          The IDC Plan provides for distribution to all eligible investors, for"
"1072","the periods spanning January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2003 (for the IFG Fair"
"1073","Fund) and January 1, 2001 through September 30, 2003 (for the AIM Fair Fund),"
"1074","their proportionate share of the applicable Fair Fund to compensate such"
"1075","investors for injury they may have suffered as a result of market timing in the"
"1076","affected funds. The IDC Plan includes a provision for any residual amounts in"
"1077","the Fair Funds to be distributed in the future to the affected funds. Further"
"1078","details regarding the IDC Plan and distributions thereunder are available on"
"1079","Invesco's Web site, available at http://www.invesco.com/us."
"1080","At the present time, management of Invesco and the Invesco Funds are unable to"
"1081","estimate the impact, if any, that the outcome of the Pending Litigation and"
"1082","Regulatory Inquiries described herein may have on Invesco, Invesco Distributors"
"1083","or the Invesco Funds."
"1084","Pending Regulatory Action Alleging Market Timing"
"1085","          On August 30, 2005, the West Virginia Office of the State Auditor -"
"1086","Securities Commission (WVASC) issued a Summary Order to Cease and Desist and"
"1087","Notice of Right to Hearing to Invesco and Invesco Distributors (Order No."
"1088","05-1318). The WVASC makes findings of fact that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"1089","entered into certain arrangements permitting market timing of the Invesco Funds"
"1090","and failed to disclose these arrangements in the prospectuses for such Funds,"
"1091","and conclusions of law to the effect that Invesco and Invesco Distributors"
"1092","violated the West Virginia securities laws. The WVASC orders Invesco and Invesco"
"1093","Distributors to cease any further violations and seeks to impose monetary"
"1094","sanctions, including restitution to affected investors, disgorgement of fees,"
"1095","reimbursement of investigatory, administrative and legal costs and an"
"1096","administrative assessment, to be determined by the Commissioner. Initial"
"1097","research indicates that these damages could be limited or capped by statute. By"
"1098","agreement with the Commissioner of Securities, Invesco's time to respond to that"
"1099","Order has been indefinitely suspended."
"1100","Private Civil Actions Alleging Market Timing"
"1101","          Multiple civil lawsuits, including purported class action and"
"1102","shareholder derivative suits, have been filed against various parties"
"1103","(including, depending on the lawsuit, certain Invesco Funds, IFG, Invesco,"
"1104","Invesco Aim Management Group, Inc., n/k/a Invesco Management Group, Inc. and"

"1110","allegations of improper market timing and related activity in"
"1111","the Invesco Funds. These lawsuits allege a variety of theories of recovery,"
"1112","including but not limited to: (i) violation of various provisions of the Federal"
"1113","and state securities laws; (ii) violation of various provisions of Employee"
"1114","Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA); (iii) breach of"
"1115","fiduciary duty; and/or (iv) breach of contract. These lawsuits were initiated in"
"1116","both Federal and state courts and seek such remedies as compensatory damages;"
"1117","restitution; injunctive relief; disgorgement of management fees; imposition of a"
"1118","constructive trust; removal of certain directors and/or employees; various"
"1119","corrective measures under ERISA; rescission of certain Funds' advisory"
"1120","agreements; interest; and attorneys' and experts' fees. All lawsuits based on"
"1121","allegations of market timing, late trading, and related issues have been"
"1122","transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland"
"1123","(the MDL Court) for consolidated or coordinated pre-trial proceedings."
"1124","          Pursuant to an Order of the MDL Court, plaintiffs in these lawsuits"
"1125","consolidated their claims for pre-trial purposes into three amended complaints"
"1126","against various Invesco - and IFG-related parties. The parties in the amended"
"1127","complaints have agreed in principle to settle the actions. A list identifying"
"1128","the amended complaints in the MDL Court and details of the settlements are"
"1129","discussed below."

"1142","          1:04-MD-15864-FPS), filed on September 29, 2004."
"1143","          On March 1, 2006, the MDL Court dismissed all derivative causes of"
"1144","action in the Essenmacher lawsuit but two: (i) the excessive fee claim under"
"1145","Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act); and (ii) the"
"1146","control person liability claim under Section 48 of the 1940 Act, and all"
"1147","claims asserted in the Lepera class action lawsuit but three: (i) the securities"
"1148","fraud claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (ii)"
"1149","the excessive fee claim under Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act (which survived only"
"1150","insofar as plaintiffs seek recovery of fees associated with the assets involved"
"1151","in market timing); and (iii) the control person liability claim under Section"
"1152","48 of the 1940 Act. On June 14, 2006, the MDL Court entered an order dismissing"
"1153","the Section 48 claim in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. Based on the MDL"
"1154","Court's March 1, 2006 and June 14, 2006 orders, all claims asserted against the"
"1155","Funds that were transferred to the MDL Court were dismissed, although certain"
"1156","Funds remain nominal defendants in the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuit. On"
"1157","January 5, 2008, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle both"
"1158","the class action (Lepera) and the derivative (Essenmacher) lawsuits, subject to"
"1159","the MDL Court approval. Individual class members have the right to object."
"1160","          On September 15, 2006, Judge Motz for the MDL Court granted the"
"1161","Defendants' motion to dismiss the ERISA (Calderon) lawsuit and dismissed such"
"1162","lawsuit. The Plaintiff appealed this decision. On June 16, 2008, the Fourth"
"1163","Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal and remanded this lawsuit back"
"1164","to the MDL Court for further proceedings. On December 15, 2008, the parties"
"1165","reached an agreement in principle to settle this lawsuit, subject to the MDL"
"1166","Court approval. Individual class members have the right to object. No payments"
"1167","are required under the settlement; however, the parties agreed that certain"
"1168","limited changes to benefit plans and participants' accounts would be made."

"1173","     AVERY JACKSON, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED"
"1174","     V. VAN KAMPEN SERIES FUND INC. AND VAN KAMPEN INVESTMENT ADVISORY CORP. On"
"1175","     December 18, 2003, a class action was filed alleging defendants failed to"
"1176","     make daily adjustments for fluctuations between the US and foreign markets"
"1177","     in calculating net asset values in the Van Kampen International Magnum"
"1178","     Fund, which subsequently reorganized into the Van Kampen International"
"1179","     Advantage Fund, n/k/a the Invesco Van Kampen International Advantage Fund,"
"1180","     thereby exposing long-term shareholders to market timing trades. This"
"1181","     matter is stayed pending the Appeal in a companion case (Kircher v."
"1182","     Putnam). On January 6, 2010, the Fifth District issued a ruling in Kircher"
"1183","     holding on identical facts that the plaintiffs' claims were precluded under"
"1184","     SLUSA and ordered the Circuit Court to dismiss the case. The petition for"
"1185","     rehearing filed by the plaintiff in Kircher was denied. On March 30, 2010,"
"1186","     the appellate court issued a mandate remanding the case back to the trial"
"1187","     court to be dismissed with prejudice. Plaintiff in Kircher then filed a"
"1188","     motion to amend its complaint, which has yet to be ruled on by the trial"
"1189","     court. Based on the appellate court's ruling, Van Kampen intends to file a"
"1190","     motion to have its case, which is based on identical facts as Kircher,"
"1191","     dismissed as well."

"1842","          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the covenants"

"1844","follows:"
"1845","1.   DESCRIPTION OF THE REORGANIZATIONS"
"1846","     1.1. It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Reorganization"
"1847","described herein shall be conducted separately of the others, and a party that"
"1848","is not a party to a Reorganization shall incur no obligations, duties or"
"1849","liabilities with respect to such Reorganization by reason of being a party to"
"1850","this Agreement. If any one or more Reorganizations should fail to be"
"1851","consummated, such failure shall not affect the other Reorganizations in any way."
"1852","<PAGE>"
"1853","     1.2. Provided that all conditions precedent to a Reorganization set forth"
"1854","herein have been satisfied as of the Closing Date (defined in Section 3.1), and"
"1855","based on the representations and warranties each party provides to the others,"
"1856","each Target Entity and its corresponding Acquiring Entity agree to take the"
"1857","following steps with respect to their Reorganization(s), the parties to which"
"1858","and classes of shares to be issued in connection with which are set forth in"
"1859","Exhibit A:"
"1860","          (a) The Target Fund shall transfer all of its Assets, as defined and"
"1861","     set forth in Section 1.2(b), to the Acquiring Fund, and the Acquiring Fund"
"1862","     in exchange therefor shall assume the Liabilities, as defined and set forth"
"1863","     in Section 1.2(c), and deliver to the Target Fund the number of full and"
"1864","     fractional Acquiring Fund shares determined in the manner set forth in"
"1865","     Section 2."
"1866","          (b) The assets of the Target Fund to be transferred to the Acquiring"
"1867","     Fund shall consist of all assets and property, including, without"
"1868","     limitation, all cash, securities, commodities and futures interests, claims"
"1869","     (whether absolute or contingent, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued and"
"1870","     including, without limitation, any interest in pending or future legal"
"1871","     claims in connection with past or present portfolio holdings, whether in"
"1872","     the form of class action claims, opt-out or other direct litigation claims,"
"1873","     or regulator or government-established investor recovery fund claims, and"
"1874","     any and all resulting recoveries) and dividends or interest receivable that"
"1875","     are owned by the Target Fund and any deferred or prepaid expenses shown as"
"1876","     an asset on the books of the Target Fund on the Closing Date, except for"
"1877","     cash, bank deposits or cash equivalent securities in an amount necessary to"
"1878","     pay the estimated costs of extinguishing any Excluded Liabilities (as"
"1879","     defined in Section 1.2(c)) and cash in an amount necessary to pay any"
"1880","     distributions pursuant to Section 7.1(g) (collectively, Assets)."
"1881","          (c) The Acquiring Fund shall assume all of the liabilities of the"
"1882","     Target Fund, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at"
"1883","     the Closing Date, except for the Target Fund's Excluded Liabilities (as"
"1884","     defined below), if any, pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, with"
"1885","     respect to each Target Fund separately, Liabilities). Each Target Fund"
"1886","     will use its best efforts to discharge all known Liabilities prior to or at"
"1887","     the Valuation Date (as defined in Section 2.1(a)) to the extent possible"
"1888","     and consistent with its own investment objectives and policies and normal"
"1889","     business operations. If prior to the Closing Date the Acquiring Entity"
"1890","     identifies a liability that the Acquiring Entity and the Target Entity"
"1891","     mutually agree should not be assumed by the Acquiring Fund, such liability"
"1892","     shall be excluded from the definition of Liabilities hereunder and shall be"
"1893","     listed on a Schedule of Excluded Liabilities to be signed by the Acquiring"
"1894","     Entity and the Target Entity at Closing and attached to this Agreement as"
"1895","     Schedule 1.2(c) (the Excluded Liabilities). The Assets minus the"
"1896","     Liabilities of a Target Fund shall be referred to herein as the Target"
"1897","     Fund's Net Assets."
"1898","          (d) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Target"
"1899","     Fund will distribute to its shareholders of record (Target Fund
     Shareholders) the shares of the Acquiring Fund of the corresponding class"
"1900","     received by the Target Fund pursuant to Section 1.2(a), as set forth in"
"1901","     Exhibit A, on a pro rata basis within that class, and without"
"1902","                                       -2-"
"1903","<PAGE>"
"1904","     further notice the outstanding shares of the Target Fund will be redeemed"
"1905","     and cancelled as permitted by its charter and applicable law, and the"
"1906","     Target Fund will as promptly as practicable completely liquidate and"
"1907","     dissolve. Such distribution and liquidation will be accomplished, with"
"1908","     respect to each class of the Target Fund's shares, by the transfer of the"
"1909","     Acquiring Fund shares of the corresponding class then credited to the"
"1910","     account of the Target Fund on the books of the Acquiring Fund to open"
"1911","     accounts on the share records of the Acquiring Fund in the names of the"
"1912","     Target Fund Shareholders of the class. The aggregate net asset value of the"
"1913","     Acquiring Fund shares to be so credited to the corresponding Target Fund"
"1914","     Shareholders shall be equal to the aggregate net asset value of the"
"1915","     corresponding Target Fund's shares owned by the Target Fund Shareholders on"
"1916","     the Valuation Date. The Acquiring Fund shall not issue certificates"
"1917","     representing shares in connection with such exchange."
"1918","          (e) Ownership of Acquiring Fund shares will be shown on its books, as"
"1919","     such are maintained by the Acquiring Fund's transfer agent."
"1920","2.   VALUATION"
"1921","     2.1. With respect to each Reorganization:"
"1922","          (a) The value of the Target Fund's Assets shall be the value of such"
"1923","     Assets computed as of immediately after the close of regular trading on the"
"1924","     New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which shall reflect the declaration of"
"1925","     any dividends, on the business day next preceding the Closing Date (the"
"1926","     Valuation Date), using the Target Fund's valuation procedures established"
"1927","     by the Target Entity's Board of Trustees, which shall be provided to the"
"1928","     Acquiring Fund prior to the Valuation Date."
"1929","          (b) The net asset value per share of each class of the Acquiring Fund"
"1930","     shares issued in connection with the Reorganization shall be the net asset"
"1931","     value per share of the corresponding class of the Target Fund as of the"
"1932","     close of business on the Valuation Date, provided that, if more than one"
"1933","     class of shares of the Target Fund is being exchanged for a single class of"
"1934","     shares of the Acquiring Fund, then the net asset value per share of such"
"1935","     class of shares of the Acquiring Fund issued in connection with the"
"1936","     Reorganization shall be the net asset value per share of the corresponding"
"1937","     class of the Target Fund having attributes most consistent with the"
"1938","     Acquiring Fund share class, as determined by the Acquiring Fund (the"
