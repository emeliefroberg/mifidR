"3100","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"3101","To the Board of Trustees of MFS Variable Insurance Trust III and the"
"3102","Shareholders of MFS Blended Research Small Cap Equity Portfolio, MFS"
"3103","Conservative Allocation Portfolio, MFS Global Real Estate Portfolio, MFS Growth"
"3104","Allocation Portfolio, MFS Inflation-Adjusted Bond Portfolio, MFS Limited"
"3105","Maturity Portfolio, MFS Mid Cap Value Portfolio, MFS Moderate Allocation"
"3106","Portfolio and MFS New Discovery Value Portfolio (collectively, the Funds):"
"3107","In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements of the Funds"
"3108","as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards"
"3109","of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"3110","the Funds' internal control over financial reporting, including controls over"
"3111","safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for"
"3112","the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements and to comply"
"3113","with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an"
"3114","opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial"
"3115","reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"3116","The management of the Funds is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"3117","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"3118","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"3119","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"3120","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"3121","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"3122","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"3123","accounting principles. A fund's internal control over financial reporting"
"3124","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"3125","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"3126","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable"
"3127","assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of"
"3128","financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"3129","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only"
"3130","in accordance with authorizations of management of the fund and trustees of the"
"3131","trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"3132","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a fund's assets"
"3133","that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"3134","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3135","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"3136","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3137","inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance"
"3138","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"3139","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design"
"3140","or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal"
"3141","course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3142","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"3143","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"3144","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a fund's"
"3145","annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a"
"3146","timely basis."
"3147","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting was"
"3148","for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3149","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"3150","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting"
"3151","Oversight Board (placecountry-regionUnited States). However, we noted no"
"3152","deficiencies in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting and its"
"3153","operation, including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"3154","be a material weakness, as defined above, as of December 31, 2014."
"3155","This report is intended solely for the information and use of management, the"
"3156","Board of Trustees of MFS Variable Insurance Trust III and the Securities and"
"3157","Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone"
"3158","other than these specified parties."

"3221","of considering the removal of a person serving as Trustee shall be called by the"
"3222","Trustees if they are requested  in  writing  to do so by Shareholders holding in"
"3223","the aggregate Shares representing not less than  ten percent (10%) of the voting"

"3233","date  of  such  adjourned  meeting  is more than 90 days after the notice of the"
"3234","meeting  was  mailed  or sent. Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  either  the"
"3235","President or Clerk of the  Trust,  or  in  the  absence or unavailability of the"
"3236","President and the Clerk, any officer of the Trust,  determines  that as a result"
"3237","of force majeure or an act of God or war, the date, time or place designated for"
"3238","a meeting or adjourned meeting of Shareholders is not reasonably  practicable or"
"3239","available,  such officer may, without further notice to Shareholders,  designate"
"3240","such other date,  time  or  place  for such meeting or adjourned meeting as such"
"3241","officer shall, in his or her sole discretion, determine. No notice need be given"
"3242","to any Shareholder who shall have failed  to  inform  the  Trust  of his current"
"3243","address or if a written waiver of notice, executed before or after  the  meeting"
"3244","by  the  Shareholder  or  his  attorney  thereunto authorized, is filed with the"
"3245","records of the meeting."
"3246","      SECTION 3. RECORD DATE FOR MEETINGS.  For  the  purpose of determining the"
"3247","Shareholders who are entitled to notice of and to vote  at  any  meeting,  or to"
"3248","participate  in  any  distribution,  or for the purpose of any other action, the"
"3249","Trustees may from time to time close the  transfer  books  for  such period, not"
"3250","exceeding  thirty  (30) days, as the Trustees may determine; or without  closing"
"3251","the transfer books the  Trustees  may  fix a date not more than ninety (90) days"
"3252","prior to the date of any meeting of Shareholders or distribution or other action"
"3253","as  a  record  date  for the determination of  the  persons  to  be  treated  as"
"3254","Shareholders of record  for  such purpose. The Trustees also may select the time"
"3255","of  day  as  of which the calculations  for  determining  how  many  votes  each"
"3256","Shareholder is entitled to pursuant to the Declaration shall be performed."
"3257","      SECTION  4.  PROXIES. At any meeting of Shareholders, any holder of Shares"
"3258","entitled to vote thereat  may  vote  by  proxy,  provided that no proxy shall be"
"3259","voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Clerk, or"
"3260","with  such  other officer or agent of the Trust as the  Clerk  may  direct,  for"
"3261","verification  prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a"
"3262","vote of a majority  of the Trustees, proxies may be solicited in the name of one"
"3263","or more Trustees or one  or more of the officers of the Trust. When any Share is"
"3264","held jointly by several persons,  any  one  of  them  may vote at any meeting in"
"3265","person  or  by proxy in respect of such Share (and a proxy  shall  be  valid  if"
"3266","executed by any  one  of them), but if more than one of them shall be present at"
"3267","such meeting in person  or  by  proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so"
"3268","present disagree as to any vote to  be  cast, such vote shall not be received in"
"3269","respect of such Share. A proxy purporting  to  be  executed by or on behalf of a"
"3270","Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise,"
"3271","and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the  challenger.  The placing"
"3272","of  a  Shareholder's  name  on  a proxy pursuant to telephonic or electronically"
"3273","transmitted instructions obtained  pursuant to procedures reasonably designed to"
"3274","verify that such instructions have been  authorized  by  such  Shareholder shall"
"3275","constitute execution of such proxy by or on behalf of such Shareholder.  If  the"
"3276","holder  of any such Share is a minor or a person of unsound mind, and subject to"
"3277","guardianship  or  to the legal control of any other person as regards the charge"
"3278","or management of such  Share,  he  may vote by his guardian or such other person"
"3279","appointed or having such control, and  such  vote  may  be given in person or by"
"3280","proxy. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of a"
"3281","proxy may be substituted for or used in lieu of the original  proxy  for any and"
"3282","all  purposes  for  which  the original proxy could be used, provided that  such"
"3283","copy, facsimile telecommunication  or  other  reproduction  shall  be a complete"
"3284","reproduction of the entire original proxy or the portion thereof to  be returned"
"3285","by the Shareholder."
"3286","      SECTION  5.  QUORUM  AND  ADJOURNMENT.   Except  when  a larger quorum  is"
"3287","required by any provision of law, Shares representing one-third  of  the  voting"
"3288","power  of  the outstanding Shares entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum  at"
"3289","any meeting  of  Shareholders,  except  that  where  any  provision  of law, the"
"3290","Declaration or these By-laws requires that holders of any series or class  shall"
"3291","vote as a series or class, then Shares representing a one-third (unless a larger"
"3292","quorum  is  required  as  specified  above) of the voting power of the aggregate"
"3293","number of Shares of that series or class  entitled to vote shall be necessary to"
"3294","constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by that series or class. Any"
"3295","lesser number shall be sufficient to adjourn.  Only Shareholders of record shall"
"3296","be entitled to vote on any matter. Outstanding  Shares  represented in person or"
"3297","by proxy (including Shares which abstain or do not vote with  respect  to one or"
"3298","more  of  any proposals presented for Shareholder approval) will be counted  for"
"3299","purposes of  determining  whether  a quorum is present at a meeting. Abstentions"
"3300","will be treated as Shares that are present  and entitled to vote for purposes of"
"3301","determining the number of Shares that are present  and  entitled  to  vote  with"
"3302","respect  to  any particular proposal, but will not be counted as a vote in favor"
"3303","of such proposal.  If  a  broker  or  nominee  holding  Shares  in street name"
"3304","indicates on the proxy that it does not have discretionary authority  to vote as"
"3305","to  a  particular  proposal, those Shares will not be considered as present  and"
"3306","entitled to vote with respect to such proposal."
"3307","      SECTION 6. INSPECTION  OF  RECORDS. The records of the Trust shall be open"
"3308","to inspection by Shareholders to the same extent as is permitted shareholders of"
"3309","a Massachusetts business corporation."
"3310","      SECTION 7. ACTION WITHOUT MEETING.  Any  action  which  may  be  taken  by"
"3311","Shareholders  may  be  taken  without  a  meeting if Shareholders holding Shares"
"3312","representing a majority of the voting power  of  the  Shares entitled to vote on"
"3313","the matter (or such larger proportion thereof as shall  be  required by law, the"
"3314","Declaration or these By-Laws for approval of such matter) consent  to the action"
"3315","in  writing and the written consents are filed with the records of the  meetings"
"3316","of Shareholders.  Such consent shall be treated for all purposes as a vote taken"
"3317","at a meeting of Shareholders."

"3320","      SECTION 1. MEETINGS  OF THE TRUSTEES. The Trustees may in their discretion"
"3321","provide for regular or stated  meetings  of  the  Trustees. Notice of regular or"
"3322","stated meetings need not be given. Meetings of the  Trustees  other than regular"
"3323","or stated meetings shall be held whenever called by the Chair of the Trustees or"
"3324","by any one of the Trustees at the time being in office. Notice  of  the time and"
"3325","place  of each meeting other than regular or stated meetings shall be  given  by"
"3326","the Secretary  or  an Assistant Secretary, or the Clerk or an Assistant Clerk or"
"3327","by the officer, Chair  of  the Trustees or other Trustee calling the meeting and"
"3328","shall be mailed to each Trustee  at  least two days before the meeting, or shall"
"3329","be telegraphed, cabled, or wirelessed  or  sent by facsimile or other electronic"
"3330","means to each Trustee at his usual or last known  business or residence address,"
"3331","or personally delivered to him at least one day before  the meeting. Such notice"
"3332","may, however, be waived by any Trustee. Notice of a meeting need not be given to"
"3333","any Trustee if a written waiver of notice, executed by him  before  or after the"
"3334","meeting, is filed with the records of the meeting, or to any Trustee who attends"
"3335","the meeting without protesting prior thereto or at its commencement the  lack of"
"3336","notice to him. A notice or waiver of notice need not specify the purpose of  any"
"3337","meeting. Except as provided by law the Trustees may meet by means of a telephone"
"3338","conference  circuit  or  similar  communications equipment by means of which all"
"3339","persons  participating in the meeting  can  hear  each  other,  which  telephone"
"3340","conference  meeting  shall  be deemed to have been held at a place designated by"
"3341","the Trustees at the meeting.  Participation  in  a  telephone conference meeting"
"3342","shall constitute presence in person at such meeting."
"3343","      SECTION 2. QUORUM AND MANNER OF ACTING. A majority  of  the Trustees shall"
"3344","be  present  at  any  regular  or  special meeting of the Trustees in  order  to"
"3345","constitute a quorum for the transaction  of business at such meeting and (except"
"3346","as otherwise required by law, the Declaration  or  these  By-Laws)  the act of a"
"3347","majority  of  the  Trustees  present  at any such meeting, at which a quorum  is"
"3348","present,  shall be the act of the Trustees.  In  the  absence  of  a  quorum,  a"
"3349","majority of the Trustees present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until"
"3350","a quorum shall  be  present.  Notice  of an adjourned meeting need not be given."
"3351","Any action required or permitted to be  taken at any meeting of the Trustees may"
"3352","be taken by the Trustees without a meeting if a majority of the Trustees consent"
"3353","to the action in writing and the written  consents are filed with the records of"
"3354","the  Trustees' meeting.  Such consents shall  be  treated  as  a  vote  for  all"
"3355","purposes."
