<TEXT>

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED
                          INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

     This AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT is made as of this 6th day of August
2003, and amended as of October 1, 2005 and March 27, 2009, between Wells Fargo
Funds Trust (the Trust), a statutory trust organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware with its principal place of business at 525 Market Street,
12th Floor, San Francisco, California, 94105 and Wells Fargo Funds Management,
LLC (the Adviser), a limited liability company organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware with its principal place of business at 525 Market Street,
12th Floor, San Francisco, California, 94105.

     WHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the 1940 Act) as an open-end management investment company and is
authorized to issue interests (as defined in the Trust's Declaration of Trust,
as amended and supplemented from time to time), in separate series; and

     WHEREAS, the Trust desires that the Adviser provide investment advisory
services to each series of the Trust listed on Schedule A hereto as such
Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to time by mutual agreement
(each a Fund and collectively the Funds), and the Adviser is willing to
provide those services on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;

     NOW THEREFORE, the Trust and the Adviser agree as follows:

     SECTION 1. APPOINTMENT OF THE ADVISER. The Trust is engaged in the business
of investing and reinvesting its assets in securities of the type and in
accordance with the limitations specified in its Declaration of Trust, as
amended and supplemented from time to time, By-Laws (if any) and Registration
Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission)
under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act),
including any representations made in the prospectus and statement of additional
information relating to the Funds contained therein and as may be amended or
supplemented from time to time, all in such manner and to such extent as may
from time to time be authorized by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the Board).
The Board is authorized to issue any unissued shares in any number of additional
classes or series.

     The investment authority granted to the Adviser shall include the authority
to exercise whatever powers the Trust may possess with respect to any of its
assets held by the Funds, including, but not limited to, the power to exercise
rights, options, warrants, conversion privileges, redemption privileges, and to
tender securities pursuant to a tender offer, and participate in class actions
and other legal proceedings on behalf of the Funds.

     The Trust hereby employs Adviser, subject to the direction and control of
the Board, to manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets in the Funds
and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to provide the other
services specified in Section 2 hereof.

<PAGE>

     SECTION 2. DUTIES OF THE ADVISER.

     (a) The Adviser shall make decisions with respect to all purchases and
sales of securities and other investment assets for the Funds. Among other
things, the Adviser shall make all decisions with respect to the allocation of
the Funds' investments in various securities or other assets, in investment
styles and, if applicable, in other investment companies or pooled vehicles in
which a Fund may invest. To carry out such decisions, the Adviser is hereby
authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact for the Trust, for the account of, at
the risk of and in the name of the Trust, to place orders and issue instructions
with respect to those transactions of the Funds. In all purchases, sales and
other transactions in securities for the Funds, the Adviser is authorized to
exercise full discretion and act for the Trust in the same manner and with the
same force and effect as the Trust might or could do with respect to such
purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as with respect to all other
things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or conduct of such purchases,
sales or other transactions.

     (b) The Adviser will report to the Board at each regular meeting thereof
regarding the investment performance of the Funds since the prior report, and
will also keep the Board informed of important developments affecting the Trust,
each Fund and the Adviser, and on its own initiative will furnish the Board from
time to time with such information as the Adviser may believe appropriate,
whether concerning the individual companies whose securities are held by a Fund,
the industries in which they engage, or the economic, social or political
conditions prevailing in each country in which a Fund maintains investments. The
Adviser will also furnish the Board with such statistical and analytical
information with respect to securities in the Funds as the Adviser may believe
appropriate or as the Board reasonably may request.

          The Adviser shall promptly notify the Trust of (i) any changes
regarding the Adviser that would impact disclosure in the Trust's Registration
Statement, or (ii) any violation of any requirement, provision, policy or
restriction that the Adviser is required to comply with under Section 6 of this
Agreement. The Adviser shall immediately notify the Trust of any legal process
served upon it in connection with its activities hereunder, including any legal
process served upon it on behalf of the Funds or the Trust.

     (c) The Adviser will from time to time employ or sub-contract the services
to certain persons as the Adviser believes to be appropriate or necessary to
assist in the execution of the Adviser's duties hereunder; provided, however,
that the employment or sub-contracting with any such person shall not relieve
the Adviser of its responsibilities or liabilities hereunder and provided
further that the Adviser shall not have the authority to sub-contract advisory
responsibilities without the consent of the Trust. The cost of performance of
such duties will be borne and paid by the Adviser. No obligation may be imposed
on the Trust in any such respect.

          The Adviser shall supervise and monitor the activities of its
representatives, personnel, sub-contractors, and agents in connection with the
execution of its duties and obligations hereunder. The appropriate personnel of
the Adviser will be made available to consult with the Board at reasonable times
and upon reasonable notice concerning the business of the Trust.


                                       2

<PAGE>

     (d) The Adviser shall maintain records relating to portfolio transactions
and the placing and allocation of brokerage orders as are required to be
maintained by the Trust under the 1940 Act. The Adviser shall prepare and
maintain, or cause to be prepared and maintained, in such form, for such periods
and in such locations as may be required by applicable law, all documents and
records relating to the services provided by the Adviser pursuant to this
Agreement required to be prepared and maintained by the Trust pursuant to the
rules and regulations of any national, state, or local government entity with
jurisdiction over the Trust, including the Commission and the Internal Revenue
Service. The books and records pertaining to the Trust which are in possession
of the Adviser shall be the property of the Trust. The Trust, or the Trust's
authorized representatives, shall have access to such books and records at all
times during the Adviser's normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of
the Trust, copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by
the Adviser to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives.

     (e) With respect to a Fund, the Adviser shall have no duties or obligations
pursuant to this Agreement, during any period during which the Fund invests all
(or substantially all) of its investment assets in a registered, open-end
management investment company, or separate series thereof, in accordance with
Section 12(d)(1)(E) under the 1940 Act.

     SECTION 3. DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO THE ADVISER. The Trust has furnished
the Adviser with true, correct and complete copies of the following documents:

          (a)  The Declaration of Trust, as in effect on the date hereof;

          (b)  The Registration Statement filed with the Commission under the
               1940 Act and the Securities Act; and

          (c)  Written guidelines, policies and procedures adopted by the Trust.

     The Trust will furnish the Adviser with all future amendments and
supplements to the foregoing as soon as practicable after such documents become
available. The Trust shall furnish the Adviser with any further documents,
materials or information that the Adviser may reasonably request in connection
with the performance of its duties hereunder.

     SECTION 4. DELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES. The Adviser may carry out any of
its obligations under this Agreement by employing, subject to supervision by the
Adviser, one or more Sub-Adviser(s) who are registered as investment advisers
pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Sub-Advisers). Each
Sub-Adviser's employment will be evidenced by a separate written agreement
approved by the Board and, if required under the 1940 Act, by the shareholders
of the Fund (unless the Commission or its staff has given authorization or
issued an interpretation dispensing with the requirement of shareholder
approval). The Adviser shall not be liable hereunder for any act or omission of
any Sub-Adviser, except for failure to exercise good faith in the employment of
the Sub-Adviser and for failure to exercise appropriate supervision of such
Sub-Adviser, and as may otherwise be agreed in writing. The Adviser shall be
solely responsible for compensating any Sub-Adviser for services rendered under
any Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Adviser may, from time to time and at any time,
terminate any Sub-Adviser and reassume the responsibilities assigned to such
Sub-Adviser with respect to any Fund without obtaining the approval of the
shareholders of the Fund.


                                       3

<PAGE>

     SECTION 5. CONTROL BY BOARD. Any investment activities undertaken by the
Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any other activities undertaken
by the Adviser on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be subject to the
direction and control of the Board.

     SECTION 6. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS. In carrying out its
obligations under this Agreement, the Adviser shall at all times comply with:

     (a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and
regulations adopted thereunder;

     (b) the Registration Statement of the Trust, as it may be amended from time
to time, filed with the Commission under the Securities Act and the 1940 Act;

     (c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it may be
amended from time to time;

     (d) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to the Trust or the Funds, and any rules and regulations adopted
thereunder; and

     (e)any other applicable provisions of state or federal law, and any rules
and regulations adopted thereunder.

     SECTION 7. PROXIES. The Adviser shall have responsibility to vote proxies
solicited with respect to issuers of securities in which assets of the Funds are
invested in accordance with the Trust's policies on proxy voting.

     SECTION 8. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. In connection with the purchase and
sale of securities for the Funds, the Adviser is responsible for broker-dealer
selection and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Adviser's primary
consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best
price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular
transaction for a Fund, the Adviser will consider among other things: the best
net price available, the reliability, integrity and financial condition of the
broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in executing the order; and the value
of the expected contribution of the broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing
basis. Accordingly, the price to the Fund in any transaction may be less
favorable than that available from another broker-dealer if the difference is
reasonably justified by other aspects of the portfolio execution services
offered. Subject to such policies as the Board may from time to time determine,
the Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any
duty created by this Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a
Fund to pay a broker or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to
the Adviser an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment
transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would
have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Adviser determines in good
faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of
the brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in
terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of
the Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the


                                       4

<PAGE>

Adviser. The Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed by it
on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide brokerage and
research services within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and in compliance therewith. Such allocation shall be in such
amounts and proportions as the Adviser shall determine and the Adviser will
report on said allocations regularly to the Board, indicating the brokers to
whom such allocations have been made and the basis therefore.

     SECTION 9. EXPENSES. All of the ordinary business expenses incurred in the
operations of the Funds and the offering of their shares shall be borne by the
Funds unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement. The expenses
borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage commissions,
taxes, legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost of preparing share
certificates, custodian, transfer agent and shareholder service agent costs,
expense of issue, sale, redemption and repurchase of shares, expenses of
registering and qualifying shares for sale, expenses relating to trustees and
shareholder meetings, the cost of preparing and distributing reports and notices
to shareholders, the fees and other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection
with membership in investment company organizations and the cost of printing
copies of prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to
the Funds' shareholders.

     The Adviser shall pay its own expenses in connection with the services to
be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, the Adviser shall be
responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the
Trust: (a) to amend the Trust's registration statement or supplement the Fund's
prospectus, and circulate the same, to reflect a change in the personnel of the
Adviser responsible for making investment decisions in relation to a Fund; (b)
to obtain shareholder approval of a new sub-advisory agreement as a result of a
change in control (as such term in defined in Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act)
of the Adviser, or to otherwise comply with the 1940 Act, the Securities Act, or
any other applicable statute, law, rule or regulation, as a result of such
change; or (c) to meet other legal or regulatory obligations caused by actions
of the Adviser.

     SECTION 10. COMPENSATION.

     (a) As compensation for the advisory services provided under this
Agreement, the Trust shall pay the Adviser fees, payable monthly, at the annual
rates indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such Schedule may be amended or
supplemented from time to time;

     (b) Except as provided in the following paragraph, no fee shall be payable
hereunder with respect to a Fund during any period in which the Fund invests all
(or substantially all) of its investment assets in a single registered, open-end
management investment company, or separate series thereof, in accordance with
Section 12(d)(1)(E) under the 1940 Act (a Master-Feeder Fund structure);

     (c) The adviser shall receive a fee of 0.25% (0.35% in the case of the
WealthBuilder Funds) for asset allocation services if a Fund invests some of its
investment assets in two or more registered, open-end management investment
companies, or separate series thereof, in each case, in accordance with Section
12(d)(1)(G) under the Act, the rules thereunder or an exemptive order


                                       5

<PAGE>

issued by the Commission exempting the Fund from the provisions of Section
12(d)(1)(A) under the Act (a Fund of Funds structure).

     SECTION 11. STANDARD OF CARE. The Trust will expect of the Adviser, and the
Adviser will give the Trust the benefit of, the Adviser's best judgment and
efforts in rendering its services to the Trust, and the Adviser shall not be
liable hereunder for any mistake in judgment. In the absence of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or
duties hereunder on the part of the Adviser or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents, the Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Trust
or to any shareholders of the Trust for any act or omission in the course of, or
connected with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be
sustained in the purchase, holding or sale of any security.

     SECTION 12. NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The services of the Adviser to the Funds are
not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Adviser shall be free to render
investment advisory or other services to others (including other investment
companies) and to engage in other activities. It is understood and agreed that
officers or directors of the Adviser may serve as officers and directors of the
Trust, and that officers or directors of the Trust may serve as officers or
directors of the Adviser, to the extent that such services may be permitted by
law, and that the officers and directors of the Adviser are not prohibited from
engaging in any other business activity or from rendering services to any other
person, or from serving as partners, officers, directors or trustees of any
other firm or trust, including other investment advisory companies.

     SECTION 13. RECORDS. The Adviser shall, with respect to orders the Adviser
places for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities of the Funds, maintain
or arrange for the maintenance of the documents and records required pursuant to
Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act as well as such records as the Funds'
administrator reasonably requests to be maintained, including, but not limited
to, trade tickets and confirmations for portfolio trades. All such records shall
be maintained in a form acceptable to the Trust and in compliance with the
provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any successor rule. All such records will be the
property of the Trust and will be made available for inspection and use by the
Trust and its authorized representatives.

     SECTION 14. TERM AND APPROVAL. This Agreement shall become effective with
respect to a Fund after approved in accordance with the requirements of the 1940
Act, and executed by the Adviser and the Trust, and shall thereafter continue
from year to year, provided that the continuation of the Agreement is
specifically approved in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act, which
currently requires that the continuation be approved at least annually:

     (a) by the Board, or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting"
"2296","securities of the Fund (as defined in Section 2(a)(42) of the 1940 Act), and

     (b) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees who are
not parties to this Agreement or interested persons (as defined in the 1940
Act) of a party to this Agreement (other than as Trustees of the Trust), by
votes cast in person at a meeting specifically called for such purpose.


                                       6

<PAGE>

     SECTION 15. TERMINATION. As required under the 1940 Act, this Agreement may
be terminated with respect to a Fund at any time, without the payment of any
penalty, by vote of the Board or by vote of a majority of a Fund's outstanding
voting securities, or by the Adviser, on sixty (60) days' written notice to the
other party. The notice provided for herein may be waived by the party entitled
to receipt thereof. This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event of
its assignment, the term assignment for purposes of this paragraph having the
meaning defined in Section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, as it may be interpreted by
the Commission or its staff in interpretive releases, or by the Commission staff
in no-action letters issued under the 1940 Act.

     This Agreement may also be terminated immediately by the Trust or the
Adviser in the event that either party (i) breaches a material term of this
Agreement; or (ii) commits a material violation of any governing law or
regulation; or (iii) engages in conduct that would have a material adverse
effect upon the reputation or business prospects of such other party.

     SECTION 16. INDEMNIFICATION BY THE ADVISER. The Trust shall not be
responsible for, and the Adviser shall indemnify and hold the Trust or any Fund
harmless from and against, any and all losses, damages, costs, charges, counsel
fees, payments, expenses and liability arising out of or attributable to the
willful misfeasance, bad faith, negligent acts or reckless disregard of
obligations or duties on the part of the Adviser or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents.

     SECTION 17. INDEMNIFICATION BY THE TRUST. In the absence of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard of duties hereunder on
the part of the Adviser or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents,
the Trust hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Adviser against all
claims, actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity whether brought by a
private party or a governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or
instrumentality of any kind, arising from the advertising, solicitation, sale,
purchase or pledge of securities, whether of the Funds or other securities,
undertaken by the Funds, their officers, directors, employees or affiliates,
resulting from any violations of the securities laws, rules, regulations,
statutes and codes, whether federal or of any state, by the Funds, their

     SECTION 19. QUESTIONS OF INTERPRETATION. Any question of interpretation of
any term or provision of this Agreement having a counterpart in or otherwise
derived from a term or provision of the 1940 Act shall be resolved by reference
to such terms or provision of the 1940 Act and to interpretations thereof, if

pursuant to the 1940 Act. In addition, where the effect of a requirement of the
1940 Act reflected in any provision of this Agreement is revised by rule,
regulation or order of the Commission, such provision shall be deemed to
incorporate the effect of such rule, regulation or order. The duties and
obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware to the extent
that state law is not preempted by the provisions of any law of the United
States heretofore or hereafter enacted.

     SECTION 20. AMENDMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. This Agreement supersedes the
advisory agreement between the parties hereto dated March 1, 2001. No provision
of this Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but
only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which enforcement
of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought. If shareholder
approval of an amendment is required under the 1940 Act, no such amendment shall
become effective until approved by a vote of the majority of the outstanding
shares of the affected Funds. Otherwise, a written amendment of this Agreement
is effective upon the approval of the Board and the Adviser.

     SECTION 21. WELLS FARGO NAME. The Adviser and the Trust each agree that the
name Wells Fargo, which comprises a component of the Trust's name, is a
property right of the parent of the Adviser. The Trust agrees and consents that:
(i) it will use the words Wells Fargo as a component of its corporate name,
the name of any series or class, or all of the above, and for no other purpose;
(ii) it will not grant to any third party the right to use the name Wells"
"2297","Fargo for any purpose; (iii) the Adviser or any corporate affiliate of the
Adviser may use or grant to others the right to use the words Wells Fargo, or
any combination or abbreviation thereof, as all or a portion of a corporate or
business name or for any commercial purpose, other than a grant of such right to
another registered investment company not advised by the Adviser or one of its
affiliates; and (iv) in the event that the Adviser or an affiliate thereof is no
longer acting as investment adviser to any Fund, the Trust shall, upon request
by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be necessary to change its
corporate name to one not containing the words Wells Fargo and following such
change, shall not use the words Wells Fargo, or any combination thereof, as a
part of its corporate name or for any other commercial purpose, and shall use
its best efforts to cause its trustees, officers and shareholders to take any
and all actions that the Adviser may request to effect the foregoing and to
reconvey to the Adviser any and all rights to such words.

     SECTION 22. RISK ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. The Adviser does not guarantee the future
performance of the Funds or any specific level of performance, the success of
any investment decision or strategy that the Adviser may use, or the success of
the Adviser's overall management of the Funds. The Trust understands that
investment decisions made for the Funds by the Adviser are subject to various
market, currency, economic and business risks, and that those investment
decisions will not always be profitable. The Adviser will manage only the
securities, cash and other investments for which management responsibility is
delegated to it and which are held in the Funds' account(s) and, in making
investment decisions for the Funds, the Adviser will not consider any other
securities, cash or other investments owned by the Trust.

                             SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT
                         AMONG WELLS FARGO FUNDS TRUST,
                     WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, LLC AND
                        FIRST INTERNATIONAL ADVISORS, LLC

     This AGREEMENT is made as of this 9th day of July, 2010, by and among Wells
Fargo Funds Trust (the Trust), a statutory trust organized under the laws of
the State of Delaware with its principal place of business at 525 Market Street,
12th Floor, San Francisco, California 94105, Wells Fargo Funds Management, LLC
(the Adviser), a limited liability company organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware with its principal place of business at 525 Market Street,
12th Floor, San Francisco, California 94105, and First International Advisors,
LLC (the Sub-Adviser), a limited liability company organized under the laws of
the State of Delaware, with its principal place of business at One Plantation
Place, 30 Fenchurch Street, London, England, United Kingdom, EC3M 3BD.

     WHEREAS, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser are registered investment advisers
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act); and

     WHEREAS, the Trust is engaged in business as an open-end investment company
with one or more series of shares and is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act); and

     WHEREAS, the Trust's Board of Trustees (the Board) has engaged the
Adviser to perform investment advisory services for each series of the Trust
under the terms of an investment advisory agreement, dated August 6, 2003,
between the Adviser and the Trust (the Advisory Agreement); and

     WHEREAS, the Adviser, acting pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, wishes to
retain the Sub-Adviser, and the Trust's Board has approved the retention of the
Sub-Adviser, to provide investment advisory services to the series of the Trust
listed in Appendix A hereto as it may be amended from time to time (the Fund),
and the Sub-Adviser is willing to provide those services on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

     NOW THEREFORE, the Trust, the Adviser and Sub-Adviser agree as follows:

     SECTION 1. APPOINTMENT OF SUB-ADVISER. The Trust is engaged in the business
of investing and reinvesting its assets in securities of the type and in
accordance with the limitations specified in its Declaration of Trust, as
amended or supplemented from time to time, By-Laws (if any) and Registration
Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission)
under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act),
including any representations made in the prospectus and statement of additional
information relating to the Fund contained therein and as may be amended or
supplemented from time to time, all in such manner and to such extent as may
from time to time be authorized by the Board.


                                       1

<PAGE>

     Subject to the direction and control of the Board, the Adviser manages the
investment and reinvestment of the assets of the Fund and provides for certain
management and other services as specified in the Advisory Agreement.

     Subject to the direction and control of the Board and the Adviser, the
Sub-Adviser shall manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the
Fund as specified in this Agreement, and shall provide the management and other
services specified below in Section 2(a), all in such manner and to such extent
as may be directed in writing from time to time by the Adviser. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Adviser shall be responsible for
compliance with any statute, rule, regulation, guideline or investment
restriction that applies to the Fund's investment portfolio as a whole and the
Sub-Adviser's responsibility and liability shall be limited to following any
written instruction the Sub-Adviser receives from the Adviser.

     The investment authority granted to the Sub-Adviser shall include the
authority to exercise whatever powers the Trust may possess with respect to any
of its assets held by the Fund, including, but not limited to, the power to
exercise rights, options, warrants, conversion privileges, redemption
privileges, and to tender securities pursuant to a tender offer. The Sub-Adviser
shall not, however, be responsible for voting proxies, for participating in
class actions and/or other legal proceedings on behalf of the Fund, but will
provide such assistance as is reasonably requested in writing by the Adviser.

     SECTION 2. DUTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SUB-ADVISER.

     (a) The Sub-Adviser shall make decisions with respect to all purchases and
sales of securities and other investment assets for the Fund. To carry out such
decisions, the Sub-Adviser is hereby authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact
for the Trust, for the account of, at the risk of and in the name of the Trust,
to place orders and issue instructions with respect to those transactions of the
Fund. In all purchases, sales and other transactions in securities and other
assets for the Fund, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to exercise full discretion
and act for the Trust and instruct the Fund's custodian (the Custodian) in the
same manner and with the same force and effect as the Trust might or could do
with respect to such purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as with
respect to all other things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or
conduct of such purchases, sales or other transactions.

     The Sub-Adviser acknowledges that the Fund and other mutual funds advised
by the Adviser (collectively, the fund complex) may engage in transactions
with certain sub-advisers in the fund complex (and their affiliated persons) in
reliance on exemptions under Rule 10f-3, Rule 12d3-1, Rule 17a-10 and Rule 17e-1
under the 1940 Act. Accordingly, the Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that it will not
consult with any other sub-adviser of a fund in the fund complex, or an
affiliated person of a sub-adviser, concerning transactions for a fund in
securities or other fund assets. With respect to a multi-managed Fund, the
Sub-Adviser shall be limited to managing only the discrete portion of the Fund's
portfolio as may be determined from time-to-time by the Board or the Adviser,
and shall not consult with the sub-adviser as to any other portion of the Fund's
portfolio concerning transactions for the Fund in securities or other Fund
assets.


                                       2

<PAGE>

     (b) Following the close of each calendar quarter, the Sub-Adviser will
report to the Board regarding the investment performance of the Fund since the
prior report, and will also keep the Board informed of important developments
known by it to affect the Trust, the Fund and the Sub-Adviser, and on its own
initiative will furnish the Board and the Adviser from time to time with such
information as the Sub-Adviser, in its sole discretion, believes appropriate,
whether concerning the individual companies whose securities are held by a Fund,
the industries in which they engage, or the economic, social or political
conditions prevailing in each country in which the Fund maintains investments.
The Sub-Adviser will also furnish the Board and the Adviser with such
statistical and analytical information with respect to securities held by the
Fund as the Sub-Adviser, in its sole discretion, believes appropriate or as the
Board or the Adviser may reasonably request in writing.

     The Sub-Adviser shall promptly notify the Adviser of (i) any material
changes regarding the Sub-Adviser that would impact disclosure in the Trust's
Registration Statement, or (ii) any material violation of any requirement,
provision, policy or restriction that the Sub-Adviser is required to comply with
under Section 6 of this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser shall, within two business
days, notify both the Adviser and the Trust of any legal process served upon it
in connection with its activities hereunder, including any legal process served
upon it on behalf of the Adviser, the Fund or the Trust. The Sub-Adviser, upon
the written request of the Custodian, shall reasonably cooperate with the
Custodian in the Custodian's processing of class actions or other legal
proceedings relating to the holdings (historical and/or current) of the Fund.

     (c) The Sub-Adviser may from time to time employ or sub-contract the
services of certain persons as the Sub-Adviser believes to be appropriate or
necessary to assist in the execution of the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder;
provided, however, that the employment of or sub-contracting to any such person
shall not relieve the Sub-Adviser of its responsibilities or liabilities
hereunder. The cost of performance of such duties shall be borne and paid by the

                     WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, LLC AND

(the Adviser), a limited liability company organized under the laws of the

Management, LLC (the Sub-Adviser), a limited liability company organized under
the laws of the State of California, with its principal place of business at 610
Newport Center Drive, Suite 1000, Newport Beach, CA 92660.

     WHEREAS, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser are registered investment advisers

     WHEREAS, the Trust is engaged in business as an open-end investment company

under the terms of an investment advisory agreement, dated August 6, 2003,
between the Adviser and the Trust (the Advisory Agreement); and

those services on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;

     NOW THEREFORE, the Trust, the Adviser and Sub-Adviser agree as follows:

     SECTION 1. APPOINTMENT OF SUB-ADVISER. The Trust is engaged in the business
of investing and reinvesting its assets in securities of the type and in
accordance with the limitations specified in its Declaration of Trust, as
amended or supplemented from time to time, By-Laws (if any) and Registration
Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission)
under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act),
including any representations made in the prospectus and statement of additional
information relating to the Funds contained therein and as may be amended or
supplemented from time to time, all in such manner and to such extent as may
from time to time be authorized by the Board.


                                      -1-

<PAGE>

     Subject to the direction and control of the Board, the Adviser manages the
investment and reinvestment of the assets of the Funds and provides for certain
management and other services as specified in the Advisory Agreement.

     Subject to the direction and control of the Board and the Adviser, the
Sub-Adviser shall manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the
Funds as specified in this Agreement, and shall provide the management and other
services specified below in Section 2(a), all in such manner and to such extent
as may be directed in writing from time to time by the Adviser. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Adviser shall be responsible for
compliance with any statute, rule, regulation, guideline or investment
restriction that applies to the Funds' investment portfolio as a whole and the
Sub-Adviser's responsibility and liability shall be limited to following any
written instruction the Sub-Adviser receives from the Adviser.

     The investment authority granted to the Sub-Adviser shall include the
authority to exercise whatever powers the Trust may possess with respect to any
of its assets held by the Funds, including, but not limited to, the power to
exercise rights, options, warrants, conversion privileges, redemption
privileges, and to tender securities pursuant to a tender offer. The Sub-Adviser
shall not, however, be responsible for voting proxies, for participating in
class actions and/or other legal proceedings on behalf of the Funds, but will
provide such assistance as is reasonably requested in writing by the Adviser.

     SECTION 2. DUTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SUB-ADVISER.

     (a) The Sub-Adviser shall make decisions with respect to all purchases and
sales of securities and other investment assets for the Funds. To carry out such
decisions, the Sub-Adviser is hereby authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact
for the Trust, for the account of, at the risk of and in the name of the Trust,
to place orders and issue instructions with respect to those transactions of the
Funds. In all purchases, sales and other transactions in securities and other
assets for the Funds, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to exercise full discretion
and act for the Trust and instruct the Fund's custodian (the Custodian) in the
same manner and with the same force and effect as the Trust might or could do
with respect to such purchases, sales or other transactions, as well as with
respect to all other things necessary or incidental to the furtherance or
conduct of such purchases, sales or other transactions.

     The Sub-Adviser acknowledges that the Funds and other mutual funds advised
by the Adviser (collectively, the fund complex) may engage in transactions
with certain sub-advisers in the fund complex (and their affiliated persons) in
reliance on exemptions under Rule 10f-3, Rule 12d3-1, Rule 17a-10 and Rule 17e-1
under the 1940 Act. Accordingly, the Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that it will not
consult with any other sub-adviser of a fund in the fund complex, or an
affiliated person of a sub-adviser, concerning transactions for a fund in
securities or other fund assets. With respect to a multi-managed Fund, the
Sub-Adviser shall be limited to managing only the discrete portion of the Fund's
portfolio as may be determined from time-to-time by the Board or the Adviser,
and shall not consult with the sub-adviser as to any other portion of the Fund's
portfolio concerning transactions for the Fund in securities or other Fund
assets.

<PAGE>

     (b) Following the close of each calendar quarter, the Sub-Adviser will
report to the Board regarding the investment performance of the Funds since the
prior report, and will also keep the Board informed of important developments
known by it to affect the Trust, the Fund and the Sub-Adviser, and on its own
initiative will furnish the Board and the Adviser from time to time with such
information as the Sub-Adviser, in its sole discretion, believes appropriate,
whether concerning the individual companies whose securities are held by a Fund,
the industries in which they engage, or the economic, social or political
conditions prevailing in each country in which the Fund maintains investments.
The Sub-Adviser will also furnish the Board and the Adviser with such
statistical and analytical information with respect to securities held by the
Funds as the Sub-Adviser, in its sole discretion, believes appropriate or as the
Board or the Adviser may reasonably request in writing.

     The Sub-Adviser shall promptly notify the Adviser of (i) any material
changes regarding the Sub-Adviser that would impact disclosure in the Trust's
Registration Statement, or (ii) any material violation of any requirement,
provision, policy or restriction that the Sub-Adviser is required to comply with
under Section 6 of this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser shall, within two business
days, notify both the Adviser and the Trust of any legal process served upon it
in connection with its activities hereunder, including any legal process served
upon it on behalf of the Adviser, the Funds or the Trust. The Sub-Adviser, upon
the written request of the Custodian, shall reasonably cooperate with the
Custodian in the Custodian's processing of class actions or other legal
proceedings relating to the holdings (historical and/or current) of the Funds.

     (c) The Sub-Adviser may from time to time employ or sub-contract the
services of certain persons as the Sub-Adviser believes to be appropriate or
necessary to assist in the execution of the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder;
provided, however, that the employment of or sub-contracting to any such person
shall not relieve the Sub-Adviser of its responsibilities or liabilities
hereunder. The cost of performance of such duties shall be borne and paid by the
Sub-Adviser. No obligation may be imposed on the Trust in any such respect.

     The Sub-Adviser shall supervise and monitor the activities of its
representatives, personnel and agents in connection with the execution of its
duties and obligations hereunder. The appropriate personnel of the Sub-Adviser
will be made available to consult with the Adviser, the Trust and the Board at
reasonable times and upon reasonable notice concerning the business of the
Trust.

     (d) The Sub-Adviser shall maintain records relating to portfolio
transactions and the placing and allocation of brokerage orders as are required
to be maintained by the Trust under the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser shall prepare
and maintain, or cause to be prepared and maintained, in such form, for such
periods and in such locations as may be required by applicable federal
securities laws, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, including the rules and
regulations thereunder, all documents and records relating to the services
provided by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement required to be prepared
and maintained by the Trust. The books and records pertaining to the Trust which
are in possession of the Sub-Adviser shall be the property of the Trust. The
Trust, or the Trust's authorized representatives (including the


                                      -3-

<PAGE>

Adviser), shall have access to such books and records at all times during the
Sub-Adviser's normal business hours. Upon the reasonable written request of the
Trust, copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by the
Sub-Adviser to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives.

     (e) The Sub-Adviser represents and warrants to the Adviser and the Trust
that: (i) the retention of the Sub-Adviser as contemplated by this Agreement is
authorized by the Sub-Adviser's governing documents; (ii) the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement does not violate any obligation by
which the Sub-Adviser or its property is bound, whether arising by contract,
operation of law or otherwise; (iii) this Agreement has been duly authorized by
appropriate action of the Sub-Adviser and when executed and delivered by the
Sub-Adviser will be the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Sub-Adviser,
enforceable against the Sub-Adviser in accordance with the terms hereof,
subject, as to enforcement, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar
laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general equitable principles
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or law);
(iv) if Sub-Adviser furnishes to Adviser or the Trust the Sub-Adviser's
composite performance record for inclusion in a Fund's documents, (A) the
composite performance record of the Sub-Adviser's executive officers furnished
to the Adviser and the Trust in writing prior to the date hereof (the Data) is
true and correct, and has been prepared in accordance with applicable laws,
rules, regulations, interpretations and in accordance with industry guidelines
and standards with respect to standardized performance information; (B) there is
no information material to an understanding of the Data which the Sub-Adviser
has not provided in writing to the Adviser prior to the date hereof; (C) the
accounts included in the Data include all fully discretionary accounts managed
by the Sub- Adviser's executive officers designated to act as portfolio managers
of the Fund over the period covered that have investment objectives, policies
and strategies that are substantially similar to those that will be followed by
the Fund as approved by the Board; (D) the Sub-Adviser has the right, free from
any legal or contractual restrictions thereon, to the use, reproduction, and
incorporation of the Data in the public disclosure or marketing materials of the
Fund, including the prospectus and the statement of additional information and
proxy statements (the Public Disclosure); and (E) the Sub-Adviser is legally
entitled to grant, and hereby grants, such rights to the Adviser and/or the

Sub-Adviser or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents, the

in the Fund's offering materials (including the prospectus, the statement of
additional information, advertising and sales materials) and any proxy
statements that pertain to the Sub-Adviser, the portfolio managers of the Fund
and the investment of the Fund's assets.

     Nothing in this Agreement (including Sections 10, 15 or 16 of this

non-waivable provisions of any other federal or state laws.

companies.

     It is understood that the Sub-Adviser performs investment advisory services
for various clients, including accounts of clients in which the Sub-Adviser or
associated persons have a beneficial interest. The Sub-Adviser may give advice
and take action in the performance of its duties with respect to any of its
other clients, which may differ from the advice given, or the timing or nature
of action taken, with respect to the assets of the Funds. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to impose upon the Sub-Adviser any obligation to
purchase or sell

procedures governing the disclosure of Fund portfolio holdings, as amended or
supplemented from time to time. Information supplied by the Adviser or the Trust
to the Sub-Adviser in connection with performing its obligations under this

confirmations of portfolio trades, and such other records as the Adviser
reasonably requests to be maintained. All such records shall be maintained in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Adviser and the Trust and in compliance with
the provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any successor rule. All such records will be the
property of the Trust, and will be made available for inspection by the Trust

Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission)
under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act),
including any representations made in the prospectus and statement of additional
information relating to the Funds contained therein and as may be supplemented

time be authorized by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the Board). The Board is
authorized to issue any unissued shares in any number of additional classes or
series. The Trust has delivered copies of the documents listed in this Section
to the Sub-Adviser and will from time to time furnish the Sub-Adviser with any
amendments thereof.

     SECTION 2. APPOINTMENT OF SUB-ADVISER. Subject to the direction and control
of the Board, the Adviser manages the investment and reinvestment of the assets
of the Funds and provides for certain management and services as specified in
the Investment Advisory Agreement between the Trust and the Adviser with respect
to the Funds.

     Subject to the direction and control of the Board, the Sub-Adviser shall
manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the Funds, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall provide the management and other
services specified below, all in such manner and to such extent as may be
directed from time to time by the Adviser.

     SECTION 3. DUTIES OF THE SUB-ADVISER.

     (a) The Sub-Adviser shall make decisions with respect to all purchases and
sales of securities and other investment assets for the Funds. To carry out such
decisions, the Sub-Adviser is hereby authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact
for the Trust, for the account of, at the risk of and in the name of the Trust,
to place orders and issue instructions with respect to those transactions of the
Funds. In all purchases, sales and other transactions in securities for the
Funds, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to exercise full discretion and act for the
Trust in the same manner and with the same force and effect as the Trust might
or could do with respect to such purchases, sales or other transactions, as well
as with respect to all other things necessary or incidental to the furtherance
or conduct of such purchases, sales or other transactions.

     (b) The Sub-Adviser will report to the Board at each regular meeting
thereof all material changes in the Funds since the prior report, and will also
keep the Board informed of important developments affecting the Trust, the Funds
and the Sub-Adviser, and on its own initiative will furnish the Board from time
to time with such information as the Sub-Adviser may believe appropriate,
whether concerning the individual companies whose securities are held by a Fund,
the industries in which they engage, or the economic, social or political
conditions prevailing in each country in which the Fund maintains investments.
The Sub-Adviser will also furnish the Board with such statistical and analytical
information with respect to securities in the Funds as the Sub-Adviser may
believe appropriate or as the Board reasonably may request. In making purchases
and sales of securities for the Funds, the Sub-Adviser will comply with the
policies set from time to time by the Board as well as the limitations imposed
by the Trust's Declaration of Trust, as amended from time to time, By-Laws (if
any), Registration Statement under the Act and the Securities Act, the
limitations in the Act and in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
applicable to the Trust and the investment objectives, policies and restrictions
of the Funds.

     (c) The Sub-Adviser may from time to time employ or associate with such
persons as the Sub-Adviser believes to be appropriate or necessary to assist in
the execution of the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder, the cost of performance of
such duties to be borne and paid by the Sub-Adviser. No obligation may be
imposed on the Trust in any such respect.

     (d) The Sub-Adviser shall maintain records relating to portfolio
transactions and the placing and allocation of brokerage orders as are required
to be maintained by the Trust under the Act. The Sub-Adviser shall prepare and
maintain, or cause to be prepared and maintained, in such form, for such periods
and in such locations as may be required by applicable law, all documents and
records relating to the services provided by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this
Agreement required to be prepared and maintained by the Trust pursuant to the
rules and regulations of any national, state, or local government entity with
jurisdiction over the Trust, including the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the Internal Revenue Service. The books and records pertaining to the Trust
which are in possession of the Sub-Adviser shall be the property of the Trust.
The Trust, or the Trust's authorized representatives (including the Adviser),
shall have access to such books and records at all times during the
Sub-Adviser's normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of the Trust,
copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by the
Sub-Adviser to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives.

     SECTION 4. CONTROL BY BOARD. As is the case with respect to the Adviser
under the Investment Advisory Agreement, any investment activities undertaken by
the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any other activities
undertaken by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be
subject to the direction and control the Trust's Board.

     SECTION 5. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS. In carrying out its
obligations under this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall at all times comply
with:

     (a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and
regulations adopted thereunder;

     (b) the provisions of the registration statement of the Trust, as it may be
amended or supplemented from time to time, under the Securities Act and the 1940
Act;

     (c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it may be
amended or supplemented from time to time;

     (d) the provisions of any By-laws of the Trust, if adopted and as it may be
amended from time to time, or resolutions of the Board as may be adopted from
time to time;

     (e) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to the Trust or the Funds;

     (f) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law; and

     In addition, any code of ethics adopted by the Sub-Adviser must comply with
Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act, as it may be amended from time to time, and any
broadly accepted industry practices, if requested by the Trust or the Adviser.

     SECTION 6. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. The Sub-Adviser is responsible for
the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds, broker-dealer selection, and
negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Sub-Adviser's primary
consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best
price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular
transaction for a Fund, the Sub-Adviser will take the following into
consideration: the best net price available, the reliability, integrity and
financial condition of the broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in
executing the order; and the value of the expected contribution of the
broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the
Fund in any transaction may be less favorable than that available from another
broker-dealer if the difference is reasonably justified by other aspects of the
portfolio execution services offered. Subject to such policies as the Trust's
Board of Trustees may from time to time determine, the Sub-Adviser shall not be
deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this
Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker
or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to the Sub-Adviser an
amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in excess
of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for
effecting that transaction, if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that
such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the
brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in
terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of
the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the
Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed
by it on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide research or
statistical material, or other services to the Funds or to the Sub-Adviser. Such
allocation shall be in such amounts and proportions as the Sub-Adviser shall
determine and the Sub-Adviser will report on said allocations regularly to the
Board of Trustees of the Trust indicating the brokers to whom such allocations
have been made and the basis therefor.

     SECTION 7. EXPENSES OF THE FUND. All of the ordinary business expenses
incurred in the operations of the Funds and the offering of their shares shall
be borne by the Funds unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement.
These expenses borne by the Trust include, but are not limited to, brokerage
commissions, taxes, legal, auditing or governmental fees, the cost of preparing
share certificates, custodian, transfer agent and shareholder service agent
costs, expense of issue, sale, redemption and repurchase of shares, expenses of
registering and qualifying shares for sale, expenses relating to trustees and
shareholder meetings, the cost of preparing and distributing reports and notices
to shareholders, the fees and other expenses incurred by the Funds in connection
with membership in investment company organizations and the cost of printing
copies of prospectuses and statements of additional information distributed to
the Funds' shareholders.

     SECTION 8. COMPENSATION. As compensation for the sub-advisory services
provided under this Agreement, the Adviser shall pay the Sub-Adviser fees,
payable monthly, the annual rates indicated on Schedule A hereto, as such
Schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to time. It is understood that
the Adviser shall be


                                       4

<PAGE>

responsible for the Sub-Adviser's fee for its services hereunder, and the
Sub-Adviser agrees that it shall have no claim against the Trust or the Funds
with respect to compensation under this Agreement.

     SECTION 9. STANDARD OF CARE. The Trust and Adviser shall expect of the
Sub-Adviser, and the Sub-Adviser will give the Trust and the Adviser the benefit
of, the Sub-Adviser's best judgment and efforts in rendering its services to the
Trust, and as an inducement to the Sub-Adviser's undertaking these services at
the compensation level specified, the Sub-Adviser shall not be liable hereunder
for any mistake in judgment. In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith,
negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or duties hereunder on the part
of the Sub-Adviser or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents, the
Sub-Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Trust or to any
shareholders in the Trust for any act or omission in the course of, or connected
with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in
the purchase, holding or sale of any security.

     SECTION 10. NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The services of the Sub-Adviser to the Adviser
and the Trust are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Sub-Adviser shall be
free to render investment advisory and administrative or other services to
others (including other investment companies) and to engage in other activities.
It is understood and agreed that officers or directors of the Sub-Adviser are
not prohibited from engaging in any other business activity or from rendering
services to any other person, or from serving as partners, officers, directors
or trustees of any other firm or trust, including other investment advisory
companies.

     SECTION 11. RECORDS. The Sub-Adviser shall, with respect to orders the
Sub-Adviser places for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities of the
Funds, maintain or arrange for the maintenance of the documents and records
required pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act as well as trade tickets and
confirmations of portfolio trades and such other records as the Adviser or the
Funds' Administrator reasonably requests to be maintained. All such records
shall be maintained in a form acceptable to the Funds and in compliance with the
provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any successor rule. All such records will be the
property of the Funds, and will be available for inspection and use by the Funds
and their authorized representatives (including the Adviser). The Sub-Adviser
shall promptly, upon the Trust's request, surrender to the Funds those records
which are the property of the Trust or any Fund. The Sub-Adviser will promptly
notify the Funds' Administrator if it experiences any difficulty in maintaining
the records in an accurate and complete manner.

     SECTION 12. TERM AND APPROVAL. This Agreement shall become effective with
respect to a Fund after it is approved in accordance with the express
requirements of the 1940 Act, and executed by the Trust, Adviser and Sub-Adviser
and shall thereafter continue from year to year, provided that the continuation
of the Agreement is approved in accordance with the requirements of the 1940
Act, which currently requires that the continuation be approved at least
annually:

"2302","of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund (as defined in Section
2(a)(42) of the 1940 Act), and

     (b) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees who are
not parties to this Agreement or interested persons (as defined in the 1940
Act) of a party to this Agreement (other than as Trustees of the Trust), by
votes cast in person at a meeting specifically called for such purpose.

     SECTION 13. TERMINATION. As required under the 1940 Act, this Agreement may
be terminated with respect to a Fund at any time, without the payment of any
penalty, by vote of the Trust's Board of Trustees or by vote of a majority of a
Fund's outstanding voting securities, or by the Adviser or Sub-Adviser, on sixty
(60) days written notice to the other party. The notice provided for herein may
be waived by the party entitled to receipt thereof. This Agreement shall
automatically terminate in the event of its assignment, the term assignment
for purposes of this paragraph having the meaning defined in Section 2(a)(4) of
the 1940 Act, as it may be interpreted by the Commission or its staff in
interpretive releases, or applied by the Commission staff in no-action letters,
issued under the 1940 Act.

     SECTION 14. INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SUB-ADVISER. The Trust shall not be
responsible for, and the Sub-Adviser shall indemnify and hold the Trust or any
Fund of the Trust harmless from and against, any and all losses, damages, costs,
charges, counsel fees, payments, expenses and liability arising out of or
attributable to the willful misfeasance, bad faith, negligent acts or reckless
disregard of obligations or duties of the Sub-Adviser or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents.

     SECTION 15. INDEMNIFICATION BY THE TRUST. In the absence of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard of duties hereunder on
the part of the Sub-Adviser or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents, the Trust hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sub-Adviser
against all claims, actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity whether
brought by a private party or a governmental department, commission, board,
bureau, agency or instrumentality of any kind, arising from the advertising,
solicitation, sale, purchase or pledge of securities, whether of the Funds or
other securities, undertaken by the Funds, their officers, directors, employees
or affiliates, resulting from any violations of the securities laws, rules,
regulations, statutes and codes, whether federal or of any state, by the Funds,
their officers, directors, employees or affiliates. Federal and state securities
laws impose liabilities under certain circumstances on persons who act in good
faith, and nothing herein shall constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights
which a Fund may have and which may not be waived under any applicable federal
and state securities laws.

     SECTION 16. NOTICES. Any notices under this Agreement shall be in writing,
addressed and delivered or mailed postage paid to the other party at such
address as such other party may designate for the receipt of such notice. Until

     SECTION 17. QUESTIONS OF INTERPRETATION. Any question of interpretation of
any term or provision of this Agreement having a counterpart in or otherwise
derived from a term or provision of the 1940 Act shall be resolved by reference
to such terms or provision of the 1940 Act and to interpretations thereof, if
any, by the United States Courts or in the absence of any controlling decision
of any such court, by rules, regulations or orders of the Commission, or
interpretations of the Commission or its staff, or Commission staff no-action
letters, issued pursuant to the 1940 Act. In addition, where the effect of a
requirement of the 1940 Act or the Advisers Act reflected in any provision of
this Agreement is revised by rule, regulation or order of the Commission, such
provision shall be deemed to incorporate the effect of such rule, regulation or
order. The duties and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

     SECTION 18. AMENDMENT. This Agreement supersedes the sub-advisory agreement
among Wells Fargo Funds Trust, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Capital
Management Incorporated dated November 8, 1999, as approved by the Board of
Trustees on March 26, 1999 as amended October 28, 1999, May 9, 2000 and July 25,
2000. No provision of this Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or
terminated orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party
against which enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is
sought. If shareholder approval of an amendment is required under the 1940 Act,
no such amendment shall become effective until approved by a vote of the
majority of the outstanding shares of the affected Funds. Otherwise, a written
amendment of this Agreement is effective upon the approval of the Board of
Trustees, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser.

     SECTION 19. WELLS FARGO NAME. The Sub-Adviser and the Trust each agree that
the name Wells Fargo, which comprises a component of the Trust's name, is a
property right of the parent of the Adviser. The Trust agrees and consents that:
(i) it will use the words Wells Fargo as a component of its corporate name,
the name of any series or class, or all of the above, and for no other purpose;
(ii) it will not grant to any third party the right to use the name Wells"
"2303","Fargo for any purpose; (iii) the Adviser or any corporate affiliate of the
Adviser may use or grant to others the right to use the words Wells Fargo, or
any combination or abbreviation thereof, as all or a portion of a corporate or
business name or for any commercial purpose, other than a grant of such right to
another registered investment company not advised by the Adviser or one of its
affiliates; and (iv) in the event that the Adviser or an affiliate thereof is no
longer acting as investment adviser to any Fund or class of a Fund, the Trust
shall, upon request by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be
necessary to change its corporate name to one not containing the words Wells"
"2304","Fargo and following such change, shall not use the words Wells Fargo, or any
combination thereof, as a part of its corporate name or for any other commercial
purpose, and shall use its best efforts to cause its trustees, officers


                                       7

<PAGE>

and shareholders to take any and all actions that the Adviser may request to
effect the foregoing and to reconvey to the Adviser any and all rights to such
words.

executed in duplicate by their respective officers on the day and year first

                             WELLS FARGO FUNDS TRUST

     This fee agreement is made as of the 27th day of March, 2009, and is
amended as of the 25th day of August, 2010, by and between Wells Fargo Funds
Management, LLC (the Adviser) and Wells Capital Management Incorporated (the
Sub-Adviser); and

     WHEREAS, the parties and Wells Fargo Funds Trust (the Trust) have entered
into an Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement (Sub-Advisory Agreement) whereby the
Sub-Adviser provides investment management advice to each series of the Trust as
listed in Appendix A to the Sub-Advisory Agreement (each a Fund and
collectively the Funds).

     WHEREAS, the Sub-Advisory Agreement provides that the fees to be paid to
the Sub-Adviser are to be as agreed upon in writing by the parties.

     NOW THEREFORE, the parties agree that the fees to be paid to the
Sub-Adviser under the Sub-Advisory Agreement shall be calculated as follows on a
monthly basis by applying the annual rates described in this Schedule A to
Appendix A for each Fund listed in Appendix A.

     The Sub-Adviser shall receive a fee as described in this Schedule A to
Appendix A of the assets of the Conservative Allocation Fund, Growth Balanced
Fund and Moderate Balanced Fund and from each WealthBuilder Portfolio for
providing services with respect to which Master Trust Portfolios (or, in the
case of the WealthBuilder Portfolios, other unaffiliated funds) these Funds will
invest in and the percentage to allocate to each Master Portfolio or
unaffiliated fund in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(G) under the Act, the rules
thereunder, or order issued by the Commission exempting the Fund from the
provisions of Section 12(d)(1)(A) under the Act (a Fund of Funds structure).

     The net assets under management against which the foregoing fees are to be
applied are the net assets as of the first business day of the month. If this
fee agreement becomes effective subsequent to the first day of a month or shall
terminate before the last day of a month, compensation for that part of the
month this agreement is in effect shall be subject to a pro rata adjustment
based on the number of days elapsed in the current month as a percentage of the
total number of days in such month. If the determination of the net asset value
is suspended as of the first business day of the month, the net asset value for
the last day prior to such suspension shall for this purpose be deemed to be the
net asset value on the first business day of the month.

                        INVESTMENT SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT
                         AMONG WELLS FARGO FUNDS TRUST,
                      WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, LLC AND
                      WELLS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT INCORPORATED

     This AGREEMENT is made as of this 1st day of March 2001, between Wells

the State of Delaware with its principal place of business at 525 Market Street,
12th Floor, San Francisco, California 94163, Wells Fargo Funds Management, LLC
(the Adviser), a limited liability company organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware with its principal place of business at 525 Market Street,
12th Floor, San Francisco, California 94163, and Wells Capital Management
Incorporated, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of California,
with its principal place of business at 525 Market Street, 12th Floor, San
Francisco, California 94163 (the Sub-Adviser).

     WHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended, (the 1940 Act) as an open-end, series management investment
company; and

     WHEREAS, the Trust and the Adviser desire that the Sub-Adviser perform
investment advisory services for each of the series of the Trust listed in
Appendix A hereto as it may be amended from time to time (each a Fund and
collectively the Funds), and the Sub-Adviser is willing to perform those
services on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;

     NOW THEREFORE, the Trust, the Adviser and Sub-Adviser agrees as follows:

     SECTION 1. THE TRUST; DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS. The Trust is engaged in the
business of investing and reinvesting its assets in securities of the type and
in accordance with the limitations specified in its Declaration of Trust, as
amended or supplemented from time to time, By-Laws (if any) and Registration
Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission)
under the 1940 Act and the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act),
including any representations made in the prospectus and statement of additional
information relating to the Funds contained therein and as may be supplemented
from time to time, all in such manner and to such extent as may from time to
time be authorized by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the Board). The Board is
authorized to issue any unissued shares in any number of additional classes or
series. The Trust has delivered copies of the documents listed in this Section
to the Sub-Adviser and will from time to time furnish the Sub-Adviser with any
amendments thereof.


                                       1

<PAGE>

     SECTION 2. APPOINTMENT OF SUB-ADVISER. Subject to the direction and control
of the Board, the Adviser manages the investment and reinvestment of the assets
of the Funds and provides for certain management and services as specified in
the Investment Advisory Agreement between the Trust and the Adviser with respect
to the Funds.

     Subject to the direction and control of the Board, the Sub-Adviser shall
manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the Funds, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall provide the management and other
services specified below, all in such manner and to such extent as may be
directed from time to time by the Adviser.

     SECTION 3. DUTIES OF THE SUB-ADVISER.

     (a) The Sub-Adviser shall make decisions with respect to all purchases and
sales of securities and other investment assets for the Funds. To carry out such
decisions, the Sub-Adviser is hereby authorized, as agent and attorney-in-fact
for the Trust, for the account of, at the risk of and in the name of the Trust,
to place orders and issue instructions with respect to those transactions of the
Funds. In all purchases, sales and other transactions in securities for the
Funds, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to exercise full discretion and act for the
Trust in the same manner and with the same force and effect as the Trust might
or could do with respect to such purchases, sales or other transactions, as well
as with respect to all other things necessary or incidental to the furtherance
or conduct of such purchases, sales or other transactions.

     (b) The Sub-Adviser will report to the Board at each regular meeting
thereof all material changes in the Funds since the prior report, and will also
keep the Board informed of important developments affecting the Trust, the Funds
and the Sub-Adviser, and on its own initiative will furnish the Board from time
to time with such information as the Sub-Adviser may believe appropriate,
whether concerning the individual companies whose securities are held by a Fund,
the industries in which they engage, or the economic, social or political
conditions prevailing in each country in which the Fund maintains investments.
The Sub-Adviser will also furnish the Board with such statistical and analytical
information with respect to securities in the Funds as the Sub-Adviser may
believe appropriate or as the Board reasonably may request. In making purchases
and sales of securities for the Funds, the Sub-Adviser will comply with the
policies set from time to time by the Board as well as the limitations imposed
by the Trust's Declaration of Trust, as amended from time to time, By-Laws (if
any), Registration Statement under the Act and the Securities Act, the
limitations in the Act and in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
applicable to the Trust and the investment objectives, policies and restrictions
of the Funds.

     (c) The Sub-Adviser may from time to time employ or associate with such
persons as the Sub-Adviser believes to be appropriate or necessary to assist in
the execution of the Sub-Adviser's duties hereunder, the cost of performance of
such duties to be borne and paid by the Sub-Adviser. No obligation may be
imposed on the Trust in any such respect.


                                       2

<PAGE>

     (d) The Sub-Adviser shall maintain records relating to portfolio
transactions and the placing and allocation of brokerage orders as are required
to be maintained by the Trust under the Act. The Sub-Adviser shall prepare and
maintain, or cause to be prepared and maintained, in such form, for such periods
and in such locations as may be required by applicable law, all documents and
records relating to the services provided by the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this
Agreement required to be prepared and maintained by the Trust pursuant to the
rules and regulations of any national, state, or local government entity with
jurisdiction over the Trust, including the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the Internal Revenue Service. The books and records pertaining to the Trust
which are in possession of the Sub-Adviser shall be the property of the Trust.
The Trust, or the Trust's authorized representatives (including the Adviser),
shall have access to such books and records at all times during the
Sub-Adviser's normal business hours. Upon the reasonable request of the Trust,
copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by the
Sub-Adviser to the Trust or the Trust's authorized representatives.

     SECTION 4. CONTROL BY BOARD. As is the case with respect to the Adviser
under the Investment Advisory Agreement, any investment activities undertaken by
the Sub-Adviser pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any other activities
undertaken by the Sub-Adviser on behalf of the Funds, shall at all times be
subject to the direction and control the Trust's Board.

     SECTION 5. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS. In carrying out its
obligations under this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser shall at all times comply
with:

     (a) all applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, and any rules and
regulations adopted thereunder;

     (b) the provisions of the registration statement of the Trust, as it may be
amended or supplemented from time to time, under the Securities Act and the 1940
Act;

     (c) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust of the Trust, as it may be
amended or supplemented from time to time;

     (d) the provisions of any By-laws of the Trust, if adopted and as it may be
amended from time to time, or resolutions of the Board as may be adopted from
time to time;

     (e) the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to the Trust or the Funds;

     (f) any other applicable provisions of state or federal law; and

     In addition, any code of ethics adopted by the Sub-Adviser must comply with
Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act, as it may be amended from time to time, and any
broadly accepted industry practices, if requested by the Trust or the Adviser.


                                       3

<PAGE>

     SECTION 6. BROKER-DEALER RELATIONSHIPS. The Sub-Adviser is responsible for
the purchase and sale of securities for the Funds, broker-dealer selection, and
negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Sub-Adviser's primary
consideration in effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best
price and execution. In selecting a broker-dealer to execute each particular
transaction for a Fund, the Sub-Adviser will take the following into
consideration: the best net price available, the reliability, integrity and
financial condition of the broker-dealer; the size of and difficulty in
executing the order; and the value of the expected contribution of the
broker-dealer to the Fund on a continuing basis. Accordingly, the price to the
Fund in any transaction may be less favorable than that available from another
broker-dealer if the difference is reasonably justified by other aspects of the
portfolio execution services offered. Subject to such policies as the Trust's
Board of Trustees may from time to time determine, the Sub-Adviser shall not be
deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached any duty created by this
Agreement or otherwise solely by reason of having caused a Fund to pay a broker
or dealer that provides brokerage and research services to the Sub-Adviser an
amount of commission for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in excess
of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for
effecting that transaction, if the Sub-Adviser determines in good faith that
such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the
brokerage and research services provided by such broker or dealer, viewed in
terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of
the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Fund and to other clients of the
Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser is further authorized to allocate the orders placed
by it on behalf of the Funds to brokers and dealers who also provide research or
statistical material, or other services to the Funds or to the Sub-Adviser. Such
allocation shall be in such amounts and proportions as the Sub-Adviser shall
determine and the Sub-Adviser will report on said allocations regularly to the
Board of Trustees of the Trust indicating the brokers to whom such allocations
have been made and the basis therefor.

negligence or reckless disregard of obligations or duties hereunder on the part
of the Sub-Adviser or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents, the
Sub-Adviser shall not be subject to liability to the Trust or to any
shareholders in the Trust for any act or omission in the course of, or connected

     SECTION 10. NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The services of the Sub-Adviser to the Adviser
and the Trust are not to be deemed to be exclusive, and the Sub-Adviser shall be
free to render investment advisory and administrative or other services to
others (including other investment companies) and to engage in other activities.
It is understood and agreed that officers or directors of the Sub-Adviser are
not prohibited from engaging in any other business activity or from rendering

or trustees of any other firm or trust, including other investment advisory
companies.

required pursuant to Rule 31a-1 under the 1940 Act as well as trade tickets and
confirmations of portfolio trades and such other records as the Adviser or the
Funds' Administrator reasonably requests to be maintained. All such records
shall be maintained in a form acceptable to the Funds and in compliance with the
provisions of Rule 31a-1 or any successor rule. All such records will be the
property of the Funds, and will be available for inspection and use by the Funds
and their authorized representatives (including the Adviser). The Sub-Adviser
shall promptly, upon the Trust's request, surrender to the Funds those records

"2305","of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund (as defined in Section
2(a)(42) of the 1940 Act), and

     (b) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Trust's Trustees who are
not parties to this Agreement or interested persons (as defined in the 1940
Act) of a party to this Agreement (other than as Trustees of the Trust), by
votes cast in person at a meeting specifically called for such purpose.

     SECTION 13. TERMINATION. As required under the 1940 Act, this Agreement may
be terminated with respect to a Fund at any time, without the payment of any
penalty, by vote of the Trust's Board of Trustees or by vote of a majority of a
Fund's outstanding voting securities, or by the Adviser or Sub-Adviser, on sixty
(60) days written notice to the other party. The notice provided for herein may
be waived by the party entitled to receipt thereof. This Agreement shall

for purposes of this paragraph having the meaning defined in Section 2(a)(4) of
the 1940 Act, as it may be interpreted by the Commission or its staff in
interpretive releases, or applied by the Commission staff in no-action letters,
issued under the 1940 Act.

     SECTION 14. INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SUB-ADVISER. The Trust shall not be
responsible for, and the Sub-Adviser shall indemnify and hold the Trust or any

disregard of obligations or duties of the Sub-Adviser or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents.

     SECTION 15. INDEMNIFICATION BY THE TRUST. In the absence of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard of duties hereunder on
the part of the Sub-Adviser or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents, the Trust hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sub-Adviser
against all claims, actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity whether
brought by a private party or a governmental department, commission, board,
bureau, agency or instrumentality of any kind, arising from the advertising,
solicitation, sale, purchase or pledge of securities, whether of the Funds or
other securities, undertaken by the Funds, their officers, directors, employees
or affiliates, resulting from any violations of the securities laws, rules,
regulations, statutes and codes, whether federal or of any state, by the Funds,
their officers, directors, employees or affiliates. Federal and state securities
laws impose liabilities under certain circumstances on persons who act in good
faith, and nothing herein shall constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights
which a Fund may have and which may not be waived under any applicable federal
and state securities laws.

     SECTION 16. NOTICES. Any notices under this Agreement shall be in writing,
addressed and delivered or mailed postage paid to the other party at such

     SECTION 17. QUESTIONS OF INTERPRETATION. Any question of interpretation of
any term or provision of this Agreement having a counterpart in or otherwise
derived from a term or provision of the 1940 Act shall be resolved by reference
to such terms or provision of the 1940 Act and to interpretations thereof, if
any, by the United States Courts or in the absence of any controlling decision
of any such court, by rules, regulations or orders of the Commission, or
interpretations of the Commission or its staff, or Commission staff no-action
letters, issued pursuant to the 1940 Act. In addition, where the effect of a
requirement of the 1940 Act or the Advisers Act reflected in any provision of
this Agreement is revised by rule, regulation or order of the Commission, such
provision shall be deemed to incorporate the effect of such rule, regulation or
order. The duties and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

     SECTION 18. AMENDMENT. This Agreement supersedes the sub-advisory agreement

Trustees on March 26, 1999 as amended October 28, 1999, May 9, 2000 and July 25,

terminated orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party
against which enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is
sought. If shareholder approval of an amendment is required under the 1940 Act,
no such amendment shall become effective until approved by a vote of the
majority of the outstanding shares of the affected Funds. Otherwise, a written
amendment of this Agreement is effective upon the approval of the Board of
Trustees, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser.

     SECTION 19. WELLS FARGO NAME. The Sub-Adviser and the Trust each agree that
the name Wells Fargo, which comprises a component of the Trust's name, is a
property right of the parent of the Adviser. The Trust agrees and consents that:
(i) it will use the words Wells Fargo as a component of its corporate name,
the name of any series or class, or all of the above, and for no other purpose;
(ii) it will not grant to any third party the right to use the name Wells"
"2306","Fargo for any purpose; (iii) the Adviser or any corporate affiliate of the
Adviser may use or grant to others the right to use the words Wells Fargo, or
any combination or abbreviation thereof, as all or a portion of a corporate or
business name or for any commercial purpose, other than a grant of such right to
another registered investment company not advised by the Adviser or one of its
affiliates; and (iv) in the event that the Adviser or an affiliate thereof is no
longer acting as investment adviser to any Fund or class of a Fund, the Trust
shall, upon request by the Adviser, promptly take such action as may be
necessary to change its corporate name to one not containing the words Wells"
"2307","Fargo and following such change, shall not use the words Wells Fargo, or any
combination thereof, as a part of its corporate name or for any other commercial
purpose, and shall use its best efforts to cause its trustees, officers

thereunder, or order issued by the Commission exempting the Fund from the
provisions of Section 12(d)(1)(A) under the Act (a Fund of Funds structure).

     The net assets under management against which the foregoing fees are to be
applied are the net assets as of the first business day of the month. If this
fee agreement becomes effective subsequent to the first day of a month or shall
terminate before the last day of a month, compensation for that part of the
month this agreement is in effect shall be subject to a pro rata adjustment
based on the number of days elapsed in the current month as a percentage of the
total number of days in such month. If the determination of the net asset value
is suspended as of the first business day of the month, the net asset value for
the last day prior to such suspension shall for this purpose be deemed to be the
net asset value on the first business day of the month.
