"1739","Report of Independent Registered Public"
"1740","Accounting Firm"
"1741","To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of"
"1742","Deutsche Value Series, Inc.:"
"1743","In planning and performing our audit of the"
"1744","financial statements of Deutsche Small Cap"
"1745","Value Fund, Deutsche CROCI Equity Dividend"
"1746","Fund, and Deutsche Mid Cap Value Fund"
"1747","(three of the funds constituting Deutsche Value"
"1748","Series, Inc.) (the Company), as of and for the"
"1749","year ended November 30, 2017, in accordance"
"1750","with the standards of the Public Company"
"1751","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we"
"1752","considered the Company's internal control over"
"1753","financial reporting, including controls over"
"1754","safeguarding securities, as a basis for"
"1755","designing our auditing procedures for the"
"1756","purpose of expressing our opinion on the"
"1757","financial statements and to comply with the"
"1758","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the"
"1759","purpose of expressing an opinion on the"
"1760","effectiveness of the Company's internal control"
"1761","over financial reporting. Accordingly, we"
"1762","express no such opinion."
"1763","The management of the Company is"
"1764","responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"1765","effective internal control over financial reporting."
"1766","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and"
"1767","judgments by management are required to"
"1768","assess the expected benefits and related costs"
"1769","of controls. A company's internal control over"
"1770","financial reporting is a process designed to"
"1771","provide reasonable assurance regarding the"
"1772","reliability of financial reporting and the"
"1773","preparation of financial statements for external"
"1774","purposes in accordance with generally"
"1775","accepted accounting principles. A company's"
"1776","internal control over financial reporting includes"
"1777","those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to"
"1778","the maintenance of records that, in reasonable"
"1779","detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"1780","transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"1781","the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance"
"1782","that transactions are recorded as necessary to"
"1783","permit preparation of financial statements in"
"1784","accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"1785","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of"
"1786","the company are being made only in"
"1787","accordance with authorizations of management"
"1788","and directors of the company; and (3) provide"
"1789","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or"
"1790","timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,"
"1791","use or disposition of a company's assets that"
"1792","could have a material effect on the financial"
"1793","statements."
"1794","Because of its inherent limitations, internal"
"1795","control over financial reporting may not prevent"
"1796","or detect misstatements. Also, projections of"
"1797","any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods"
"1798","are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"1799","inadequate because of changes in conditions,"
"1800","or that the degree of compliance with the"
"1801","policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"1802","A deficiency in internal control over financial"
"1803","reporting exists when the design or operation of"
"1804","a control does not allow management or"
"1805","employees, in the normal course of performing"
"1806","their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"1807","misstatements on a timely basis. A material"
"1808","weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of"
"1809","deficiencies, in internal control over financial"
"1810","reporting, such that there is a reasonable"
"1811","possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"1812","company's annual or interim financial"
"1813","statements will not be prevented or detected on"
"1814","a timely basis."
"1815","Our consideration of the Company's internal"
"1816","control over financial reporting was for the"
"1817","limited purpose described in the first paragraph"

"1896","Fund (a series of Deutsche Value"
"1897","Series, Inc.) (the Fund)"
"1898","Effective February 16, 2017, the Fund's investment"
"1899","strategy was changed as follows:"
"1900","Main investments. Under normal"
"1901","circumstances, the fund invests at least 80%"
"1902","of net assets, plus the amount of any"
"1903","borrowings for investment purposes, in"
"1904","dividend-paying equity securities (mainly"
"1905","common stocks). Equity securities may also"
"1906","include preferred stocks, depository receipts"
"1907","and other securities with equity characteristics,"
"1908","such as convertible securities and warrants."
"1909","Companies are selected for the fund's"
"1910","portfolio using the Cash Return on Capital"
"1911","Invested (CROCI (r)) strategy as the primary"
"1912","factor, among other factors. Portfolio"
"1913","management will select stocks from among the"
"1914","largest US companies which are under"
"1915","CROCI (r) coverage at any given time (while"
"1916","the number of companies under CROCI(r)"
"1917","coverage will vary, as of September 30, 2016,"
"1918","approximately 345 companies were under"
"1919","CROCI (r) coverage)."
"1920","Although the fund can invest in stocks of any"
"1921","economic sector (which is comprised of two"
"1922","or more industries), at times it may"
"1923","emphasize one or more sectors and may"
"1924","invest more than 25% of total assets in a"
"1925","single sector. The fund may invest up to"
"1926","20% of total assets in foreign securities."
"1927","Management process. Portfolio management"
"1928","intends to select approximately forty stocks"
"1929","based on (among other factors) the Cash"
"1930","Return on Capital Invested (CROCI(r))"

"1932","seeking above average dividend yield. The"
"1933","CROCI(r) Economic Price Earnings Ratio"
"1934","(CROCI(r) Economic P/E Ratio) is a"
"1935","proprietary measure of company valuation"
"1936","using the same relationship between"
"1937","valuation and return as an accounting P/E"
"1938","ratio (i.e. price/book value divided by return"
"1939","on equity). It is a US-specific strategy seeking"
"1940","to select approximately the forty best value"
"1941","companies under CROCI(r) coverage"
"1942","(excluding financial companies) with"
"1943","additional screening on high dividend yield,"
"1944","dividend sustainability and price volatility. At"
"1945","times, the number of stocks held in the fund"
"1946","may differ from forty stocks as a result of"

"1948","The fund is reconstituted periodically in"
"1949","accordance with the strategy's rules (re-"
"1950","selecting approximately forty stocks that"
"1951","will make up the fund). The strategy"
"1952","targets low valuation combined with"
"1953","higher dividends and excludes stocks with"
"1954","undesirable characteristics such as, for"
"1955","example, high financial leverage, low cash"
"1956","returns and high volatility which are"

"1962","Strategy and Valuation Group is not"
"1963","responsible for the management of the fund."
"1964","The Advisor, not the fund, is responsible"
"1965","for paying the licensing fees.) The strategy"
"1966","may also utilize systematic turnover control"
"1967","buffers to minimize undesired levels of"
"1968","portfolio turnover. Portfolio management"
"1969","will take additional measures to attempt to"
"1970","reduce portfolio turnover, market impact"
"1971","and transaction costs in connection with"
"1972","implementation of the strategy, by applying"
"1973","liquidity controls and managing the"
"1974","portfolio with tax efficiency in mind."
"1975","The fund may also invest in exchange-traded"
"1976","funds (ETFs). The fund's investments in"
"1977","ETFs will be limited to 5% of total assets in"
"1978","any one ETF and 10% of total assets in the"
