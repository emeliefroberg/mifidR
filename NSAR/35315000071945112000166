"2973","<P align=center>ON INTERNAL CONTROL REQUIRED BY FORM N-SAR</P>"
"2974","<P align=center>____</P>"
"2975","<P>&nbsp;</P>"
"2976","<P>To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Fidelity Salem Street Trust:</P>"
"2977","<P></P>"
"2978","<P>In planning and performing our audits of the financial statements Fidelity"
"2979","Salem Street Trust: Money Market Portfolio, Spartan Intermediate Treasury Bond"
"2980","Index Fund, Spartan Long Term Treasury Bond Index Fund, and Spartan Short Term"
"2981","Treasury Bond Index Fund (collectively, the Trust) as of and for the year"
"2982","ended February 29, 2012, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company"
"2983","Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Trust's internal"
"2984","control over financial reporting, including control activities for safeguarding"
"2985","securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of"
"2986","expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the"
"2987","requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on"
"2988","the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting."
"2989","Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's"
"2990","internal control over financial reporting.</P>"
"2991","<P>The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining"
"2992","effective internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling this"
"2993","responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the"
"2994","expected benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal control"
"2995","over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance"
"2996","regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of"
"2997","financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted"
"2998","accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting"
"2999","includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"3000","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"
"3001","transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide"
"3002","reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit"
"3003","preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted"
"3004","accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Trust are being"
"3005","made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"3006","company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely"
"3007","detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a Trust's assets"
"3008","that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>"
"3009","<P>Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting"
"3010","may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of"
"3011","effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"3012","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance"
"3013","with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>"
"3014","<P></P>"
"3015","<P>&nbsp;</P>"
"3016","<P>&nbsp;</P>"
"3017","<P>&nbsp;</P>"
"3018","<P>&nbsp;</P>"
"3019","<P></P>"
"3020","<P></P>"
"3021","<P>A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the"
"3022","design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the"
"3023","normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"3024","misstatements on a timely basis. material weakness is a deficiency, or a"
"3025","combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such"
"3026","that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"3027","Trust's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected"
"3028","on a timely basis.</P>"
"3029","<P>Our consideration of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting"
"3030","was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not"
"3031","necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial"
"3032","reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the"
"3033","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted no"
"3034","deficiencies in the Trust's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"3035","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to"
"3036","be material weaknesses as defined above as of February 29, 2012.</P>"
"3037","<P></P>"
"3038","<P>This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and"
