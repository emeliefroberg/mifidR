"910","<TEXT>"
"911","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM"
"912","To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of Fiera"
"913","Capital Series Trust:"
"914","In planning and performing our audits of the financial"
"915","statements of Fiera Capital Funds, comprising Fiera"
"916","Capital International Equity Fund, Fiera Capital"
"917","Small/Mid Cap Growth Fund and Fiera Capital Global"
"918","Equity Focused Fund (collectively, the Funds), each"
"919","portfolios of the diversified series constituting Fiera"
"920","Capital Series Trust, as of and for the periods ended"
"921","March 31, 2018, in accordance with the standards of the"
"922","Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),"
"923","we considered the Funds internal control over financial"
"924","reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities,"
"925","as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the"
"926","purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial"
"927","statements and to comply with the requirements of Form"
"928","N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"929","on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over"
"930","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such"
"931","opinion."
"932","The management of the Funds is responsible for"
"933","establishing and maintaining effective internal control"
"934","over financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,"
"935","estimates and judgments by management are required to"
"936","assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls."
"937","A funds internal control over financial reporting is a"
"938","process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding"
"939","the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation"
"940","of financial statements for external purposes in accordance"
"941","with generally accepted accounting principles. A funds"
"942","internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"943","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance"
"944","of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly"
"945","reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of"
"946","the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions"
"947","are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial"
"948","statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting"
"949","principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund"
"950","are being made only in accordance with authorizations of"
"951","management and directors of the fund; and (3) provide"
"952","reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection"
"953","of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a funds"
"954","assets that could have a material effect on the financial"
"955","statements."
"956","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"957","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"958","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"959","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"960","inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree"
"961","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"962","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"963","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"964","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"
"965","performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect"
"966","misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a"
"967","deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal"
"968","control over financial reporting, such that there is a"
"969","reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the"
"970","Funds annual or interim financial statements will not be"
"971","prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"972","Our consideration of the Funds internal control over"
"973","financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in"
"974","the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all"
"975","deficiencies in internal control that might be material"
"976","weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company"
"977","Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted"
"978","no deficiencies in the Funds internal control over financial"
"979","reporting and their operation, including controls for"
"980","safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material"
"981","weakness, as defined above, as of March 31, 2018."
"982","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"983","management and the Board of Fiera Capital Series Trust and the"
"984","Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended"
"985","to be and should not be used by anyone other than these"
"986","specified parties."

"1037","Firm"
"1038","Ladies and Gentlemen:"
"1039","At a meeting held on September 13, 2017 (the"
"1040","September Meeting), the Board of Trustees of the"
"1041","Trust, upon recommendation of the Audit Committee,"
"1042","approved the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP"
"1043","(Deloitte) as the independent registered public"
"1044","accounting firm for Fiera Capital Global Equity"
"1045","Focused Fund (the Fund), a series of the Trust,"

"1047","independent registered public accounting firm, as"
"1048","the auditor of the Fund. The Fund did not consult"
"1049","with Deloitte prior to the September Meeting."
"1050","EisnerAmpers report on the seed capital financial"
"1051","statement of the Fund for the period from December"
"1052","8, 2016 (inception) through April 18, 2017 contained"
