"523","Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"
"524","The Board of Trustees and Shareholders"
"525","Legg Mason Partners Equity Trust:"
"526","In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements"
"527","of ClearBridge Aggressive Growth Fund (the Fund), a series of"
"528","Legg Mason Partners Equity Trust, as of and for the year ended"
"529","August 31, 2017, in accordance with the standards of the Public"
"530","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered"
"531","the Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including"
"532","controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing"
"533","our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion"
"534","on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements"
"535","of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion"
"536","on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over"
"537","financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion."
"538","Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and"
"539","maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting."
"540","In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by"
"541","management are required to assess the expected benefits and"
"542","related costs of controls. A fund's internal control over"
"543","financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable"
"544","assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and"
"545","the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in"
"546","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A"
"547","fund's internal control over financial reporting includes those"
"548","policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of"
"549","records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect"
"550","the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2)"
"551","provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as"
"552","necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in"
"553","accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and"
"554","that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in"
"555","accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the"
"556","fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention"
"557","or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or"
"558","disposition of the fund's assets that could have a material"
"559","effect on the financial statements."
"560","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"
"561","financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"562","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future"
"563","periods are subject to the risk that controls may become"
"564","inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree"
"565","of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"566","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists"
"567","when the design or operation of a control does not allow"
"568","management or employees, in the normal course of performing their"
"569","assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a"
"570","timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination"
"571","of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,"
"572","such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material"
"573","misstatement of the Fund's annual or interim financial statements"
"574","will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."
"575","Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over financial"
"576","reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first"
"577","paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in"
"578","internal control that might be material weaknesses under"
"579","standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight"
"580","Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the"
"581","Fund's internal control over financial reporting and its"
"582","operation, including controls over safeguarding securities that"
"583","we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of"
"584","August 31, 2017."
"585","This report is intended solely for the information and use of"
"586","management and the Board of Trustees of Legg Mason Partners"
"587","Equity Trust and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is"
"588","not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than"
"589","these specified parties."

"621","Changes in Registrant's certifying accountant"
"622","On August 14, 2017, KPMG LLP (KPMG) resigned, at the request of"
"623","ClearBridge Aggressive Growth Fund (the Fund), as the independent"
"624","registered public accounting firm to the Fund, upon completion of the"
"625","audit of the Fund's financial statements as of and for the fiscal"
"626","period ended August 31, 2017 and the issuance of their report thereon,"
"627","dated October 18, 2017. The Audit Committee of the Fund's Board of"
"628","Trustees participated in, and approved, the decision to change the"
"629","independent registered public accounting firm. KPMG's reports on the"
"630","Fund's financial statements for the fiscal periods ended August 31,"
"631","2017 and August 31, 2016 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of"
"632","opinion nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit"
"633","scope or accounting principle. During the Fund's fiscal periods ended"
"634","August 31, 2017 and August 31, 2016 and the subsequent interim period"
"635","through October 18, 2017, (i) there were no disagreements with KPMG on"
"636","any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement"
"637","disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not"
"638","resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG, would have caused them to make"
"639","reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection"
"640","with their reports on the Fund's financial statements for such"
"641","periods, and (ii) there were no reportable events of the kind"
"642","described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K under the Securities"
"643","Exchange Act of 1934, as amended."
"644","The Audit Committee of the Fund's Board of Trustees approved the"
"645","engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as the Fund's"
"646","independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year"
"647","ending August 31, 2018. The selection of PwC does not reflect any"
"648","disagreements with or dissatisfaction by the Fund or the Board of"
"649","Trustees with the performance of the Fund's prior independent"
"650","registered public accounting firm, KPMG. During the Fund's fiscal"
"651","periods ended August 31, 2017 and August 31, 2016, and the subsequent"
"652","interim period through October 18, 2017, neither the Fund, nor anyone"
"653","on its behalf, consulted with PwC on items which: (i) concerned the"
"654","application of accounting principles to a specified transaction,"
"655","either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might"
"656","be rendered on the Fund's financial statements; or (ii) concerned the"
"657","subject of a disagreement (as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of Item"
"658","304 of Regulation S-K) or reportable events (as described in paragraph"
"659","(a)(1)(v) of said Item 304)."
"660","The Registrant has requested KPMG to furnish it with a letter"
"661","addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether"
"662","KPMG agrees with the statements contained above. A copy of the letter"
"663","from KPMG to the Securities and Exchange Commission is filed as an"
"664","exhibit hereto."
