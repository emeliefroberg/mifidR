"5625","that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the"

"5636","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over"

"5638","Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to"

"5641","the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may"
"5642","deteriorate."
"5643","A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting"
"5644","exists when the design or operation of a control does not"
"5645","allow management or employees, in the normal course of"

"5653","Our consideration of the Funds' internal control over"

"5987","Adviser will treat confidentially and as proprietary"
"5988","information of the Fund all records and other information"
"5989","relating to the Fund and prior, present or potential"
"5990","shareholders (except with respect to clients of the Investment"

"5997","contempt proceedings for failure to comply, when requested to"
"5998","divulge such information by duly constituted authorities, or"
"5999","when so requested by the Fund. Where the Investment Adviser"

"6001","failure to comply with a request for records or other"
"6002","information relating to the Fund, the Investment Adviser may"
"6003","comply with such request prior to obtaining the Fund's written"
"6004","approval, provided that the Investment Adviser has taken"

"6008","Investment Adviser and its officers may act and continue to"
"6009","act as investment managers for others, and nothing in this"
"6010","Agreement shall in any way be deemed to restrict the right of"
"6011","the Investment Adviser to perform investment management or"
"6012","other services for any other person or entity, and the"
"6013","performance of such services for others shall not be deemed to"
"6014","violate or give rise to any duty or obligation to the"
"6015","Portfolio or the Fund."
"6016","      Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict"
"6017","the Investment Adviser or any of its directors, officers,"

"6022","time, have, acquire, increase, decrease, or dispose of"

"6024","acquired or disposed of for the Portfolio.  The Investment"
"6025","Adviser shall have no obligation to acquire for the Portfolio"
"6026","a position in any investment which the Investment Adviser, its"
"6027","directors, officers, affiliates or employees may acquire for"
"6028","its or their own accounts or for the account of another"
"6029","client, so long as it continues to be the policy and practice"
"6030","of the Investment Adviser not to favor or disfavor"
"6031","consistently or consciously any client or class of clients in"

conduct).  The Portfolio will indemnify the Investment"
"6160","Adviser against and hold it harmless from any and all losses,"
"6161","claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including reasonable"
"6162","counsel fees and expenses) resulting from any claim, demand,"
"6163","action or suit not resulting from disabling conduct by the"
"6164","Investment Adviser.  Indemnification shall be made only"
"6165","following:  (i) a final decision on the merits by a court or"
"6166","other body before whom the proceeding was brought that the"
"6167","Investment Adviser was not liable by reason of disabling"
"6168","conduct or (ii) in the absence of such a decision, a"
"6169","reasonable determination, based upon a review of the facts,"
"6170","that the Investment Adviser was not liable by reason of"

"6180","shall provide to the Portfolio a written affirmation of its"
"6181","good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for"

"6183","undertaking to repay any such advance if it should ultimately"
"6184","be determined that the standard of conduct has not been met."
"6185","In addition, at least one of the following additional"
"6186","conditions shall be met:  (a) the Investment Adviser shall"
"6187","provide a security in form and amount acceptable to the"

"6192","determined, based upon a review of facts readily available to"
"6193","the Portfolio at the time the advance is proposed to be made,"
"6194","that there is reason to believe that the Investment Adviser"
"6195","will ultimately be found to be entitled to indemnification."
"6196","Any amounts payable by the Portfolio under this Section 12"
"6197","shall be satisfied only against the assets of the Portfolio"
"6198","and not against the assets of any other investment portfolio"
"6199","of the Fund."
"6200","      The limitations on liability and indemnification"
"6201","provisions of this Section 12 shall not be applicable to any"

"6884","execute a certificate of any fact found by them.  No Director"
"6885","or candidate for the office of Director shall act as inspector"
"6886","of an election of Directors.  Inspectors need not be"

"6919","office prior to the expiration of his term unless such"
"6920","Director is specifically removed pursuant to Section 5 of this"
"6921","Article III at the time of such decrease.  Directors need not"

"6933","      Section 4.  Resignation.  A Director of the Corporation"
"6934","may resign at any time by giving written notice of his"
"6935","resignation to the Board or the Chairman of the Board or the"

"6939","immediately upon its receipt; and, unless otherwise specified"
"6940","therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be"
"6941","necessary to make it effective."
"6942","      Section 5.  Removal of Directors.  Any Director of the"

"6957","A Director elected by the shareholders to fill a vacancy which"
